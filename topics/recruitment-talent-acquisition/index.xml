Yeah. Hi. Welcome to this open security summit session in October 2023.
And I&amp;rsquo;m here with Chen, and we&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about, I think, a
massive topic in our industry, which is basically how you address
cybersecurity talent gap and fundamentally the growing skill shortages
that we I think we all feel. Anybody who&amp;rsquo;s hiring and is building teams
experience this. So you want to just kick us off, Chen, and give
introduction about you and then your views on this topic?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
