&lt;p>OWASP Juice Shop is an incredible tool to learn and teach about web
application security. The Juice Shop lets people attack a real(ish) web
application - which looks like a normal eCommerce Shop - and learn step
by step about some of the most impactful vulnerabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you are running a Security Training for developers based on the
Juice Shop you have one problem: How can every developer run and access
his own Juice Shop Instance to train his skills? The Juice Shop is
basically a single user application, so every user needs to have their
own instance to train.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OWASP Juice Shop introduction</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/owasp-projects/owasp-juiceshop-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/owasp-projects/owasp-juiceshop-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWASP/owasp-swag/master/projects/juice-shop/logos/custom/JuicyBot_MedicalMask.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this &lt;strong>introduction session to OWASP Juice Shop&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>we will take a quick tour through the OWASP flagship project that
claims to be &amp;ldquo;probably the most sophisticated vulnerable web
application!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Starting with a &amp;ldquo;happy path&amp;rdquo; shopping tour we will then learn what
security flaws lurk beneath the shiny web UI surface!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>You will also learn about the CTF support, hacking instructor scripts,
tutorial mode, dos and don&amp;rsquo;ts and some technical background of the
project!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OWASP Juice Shop Introduction</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/owasp-juice-shop/owasp-juiceshop-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/owasp-juice-shop/owasp-juiceshop-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="notable-logs-from-the-chat-during-the-session">Notable logs from the chat during the session&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>17:21:39	 From Jannik : Fun Fact: The Hacking Instructor was merged during last year&amp;rsquo;s Open Security Summit :slightly_smiling_face:
17:36:48	 From Rusty : He&amp;rsquo;s using this framework &lt;br>
17:36:49	 From Rusty : &lt;a href="https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf/releases/tag/v8.1.0">https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf/releases/tag/v8.1.0&lt;/a> &lt;br>
17:51:16	 From N/A : Bjorn (sorry no umlaut on my keyboard :) ) is there any official walkthrough with all vulnerabilities and how to exploit them? &lt;br>
I&amp;rsquo;m asking this because sometimes, due to lack of time all I want is to spin a juice shop container and test/train a particular vulnerability.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
