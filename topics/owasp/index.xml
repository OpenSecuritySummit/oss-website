The Juice Shop lets people attack a real(ish) web application - which looks like a normal eCommerce Shop - and learn step by step about some of the most impactful vulnerabilities.
When you are running a Security Training for developers based on the Juice Shop you have one problem: How can every developer run and access his own Juice Shop Instance to train his skills?</description></item><item><title>OWASP Juice Shop introduction</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/owasp-projects/owasp-juiceshop-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/owasp-projects/owasp-juiceshop-introduction/</guid><description>In this introduction session to OWASP Juice Shop
we will take a quick tour through the OWASP flagship project that claims to be &amp;ldquo;probably the most sophisticated vulnerable web application!&amp;rdquo;
Starting with a &amp;ldquo;happy path&amp;rdquo; shopping tour we will then learn what security flaws lurk beneath the shiny web UI surface!
You will also learn about the CTF support, hacking instructor scripts, tutorial mode, dos and don&amp;rsquo;ts and some technical background of the project!</description></item><item><title>OWASP Juice Shop Introduction</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/owasp-juice-shop/owasp-juiceshop-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/owasp-juice-shop/owasp-juiceshop-introduction/</guid><description>Notable logs from the chat during the session 17:21:39 From Jannik : Fun Fact: The Hacking Instructor was merged during last year&amp;rsquo;s Open Security Summit :slightly_smiling_face: 17:36:48 From Rusty : He&amp;rsquo;s using this framework 17:36:49 From Rusty : https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf/releases/tag/v8.1.0 17:51:16 From N/A : Bjorn (sorry no umlaut on my keyboard :) ) is there any official walkthrough with all vulnerabilities and how to exploit them? I&amp;rsquo;m asking this because sometimes, due to lack of time all I want is to spin a juice shop container and test/train a particular vulnerability.</description></item></channel></rss>
