This can be found at https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/pattern-safely-importing-data
The pattern fundamentally recommends a Transform and Verify approach to imports as shown below:
This has some significant differences to import processes typically in use in commercial environments.
The objective of this session is to raise the awareness of this pattern, highlight the differences in the pattern and the pros/cons of them, and to explore the practicalities of using this patter in commercial environments.</description></item><item><title>Office Documents ISG - How to automate Inspection and Sanitization Guidance testing</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-office-docs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-office-docs/</guid><description>About this talk: Once learning about the potential areas of concern that exist within office documents and exploring ISGs for them, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to discover the testing strategies that will be oriented on validation of the requirements of the ISGs. This session will be dedicated to automation of ISG testing for Office documents.

Training Session Video About this talk: Portable Document Format (PDF) is one of the most widely used file formats. In this session we&amp;rsquo;re going to explore ISGs for PDF files which will include inspection and analysis on various elements and objects that are contained within the PDF file structure and how they can be a cause for concern for either hiding sensitive data or attempts to exploit a system.</description></item><item><title>Threat Modeling - Cloud Functions as Detonation Chambers - Part 1</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/hacking-and-defending/hacking-glasswall-sdk-and-cloud-thursday/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/hacking-and-defending/hacking-glasswall-sdk-and-cloud-thursday/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
