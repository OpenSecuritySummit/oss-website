&lt;p>Inspection and Sanitisation Guidance standards allow us to analyze elements and objects contained within the file structures, reveal the data hiding, data attack, and data disclosure risks. They show how identified elements can be a cause for concern for hiding sensitive data to ensure that files are safer for users to open and conform to the specification. Whilst getting acquainted to ISG standards in details in one of our sessions, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to measure and visualise these standards.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What are ISGs and how to convert ISGs into checklists?</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-converting-to-checklist/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-converting-to-checklist/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="about-this-talk">About this talk:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We live in an age where data has penetrated into all areas of our lives, where everything gets captured digitally. Data helps companies and businesses grow, expand and improve their products and services, constantly apply innovations, better serve their customers and gain new ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While more and more companies gather data and share, store and access various files, it becomes vital to analyze files, spot unknown threats and struggle with malicious content. Files inspection and sanitisation plays a significant role in reaching that goal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What security exploits are prevented by implementing ISGs</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-security-expoit-protection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-security-expoit-protection/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="about-this-talk">About this talk:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Cyber attackers want access to the user&amp;rsquo;s sensitive information or intellectual property for strategic advantage, or more commonly, for monetary gain. They commonly attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the user&amp;rsquo;s computer system and network by using malware delivered via email or web servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This session will be dedicated to a discussion of the security exploits that can be prevented by applying ISGs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ISGs can be found in this publication repo: &lt;a href="https://nsacyber.github.io/publications.html">https://nsacyber.github.io/publications.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
