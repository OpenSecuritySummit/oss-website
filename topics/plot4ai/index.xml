This threat modeling library inspired on LINDDUN GO has been created to help you build responsible AI systems. It contains currently a collection of 86 threats classified in 8 different categories. But PLOT4ai is more than a collection of threats: it also provides a card game and a methodology to make it easy and accessible to everyone working in the field of ML/AI to do threat modeling.</description></item></channel></rss>
