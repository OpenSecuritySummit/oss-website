slides About this session Eaten by SARLaC: lessons learned from failing at trying to scale-up product security teams by managing architecture diagrams, control libraries and collaboration as code.\nThis is a failure story. This is about how we identified the need of reducing toil and built a framework to try to programatically generate documents about security architecture models of new projects and products. We will deep dive into how we made possible to translate architecture diagrams to code and manage the whole process using CLI tools and git to automatically generate friendly documentation.","tags":null,"title":"Lessons learned from trying to create Architecture Diagrams As Code","type":"working-session","url":"/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/lessons_learned_from_trying_to_creat_architecture_diagrams_as_code/","weight":0,"wordcount":122},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"TBD","dir":"sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/DevSecOps/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688310011,"objectID":"6875a34aaf1fae6497d9555da9f415f0","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/devsecops/lgtm-in-action/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/devsecops/lgtm-in-action/","section":"sessions","summary":"About this talk how to use https://semmle.com/lgtm effectively ","tags":null,"title":"LGTM in action","type":"training-session","url":"/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/devsecops/lgtm-in-action/","weight":0,"wordcount":8},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"participant/organizers/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688310011,"objectID":"c1b2664df15530db1a78d47b8ef894f3","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/lianne-potter/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/participant/organizers/lianne-potter/","section":"participant","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Lianne Potter","type":"participant","url":"/participant/organizers/lianne-potter/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2023/mini-summits/Feb/DevSecOps/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688310011,"objectID":"ae34b9f3953606f52fedfd539213cbad","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/feb/devsecops/linux-kernel-containerization-without-dockerruncoci/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2023/mini-summits/feb/devsecops/linux-kernel-containerization-without-dockerruncoci/","section":"sessions","summary":"About this session A Linux® container is a set of 1 or more processes that are isolated from the rest of the system.

Louis then discusses a SaaS solution that supports grading systems in one state of the United States as their target for evaluation and identifies potential threats from students and teachers.","tags":null,"title":"Threat Modeling Kata Part 2","type":"working-session","url":"/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/threat-modeling-kata2/","weight":0,"wordcount":9453},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/threat-modeling/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":2200,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688310011,"objectID":"997b6c9653599bcf2e629999d941cbfe","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-manifesto/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":11,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-manifesto/","section":"sessions","summary":"https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/\n15 OWASP authors have come up with the Manifesto, excited to have a number of them joining us in this session.
