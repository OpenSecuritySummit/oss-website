expected it to have. While it does have much merit and has influenced security in an indispensable way, I argue that “shift left” should be viewed as a tactic in a larger management strategy rather than a comprehensive solution to solve application security woes. Just as software development is a very complicated process with many layers, “shift left” should not be viewed as a straightforward, linear effort. This presentation will review the success, concerns and potential of “shift left”  and how we can “restart” the process by applying it a little differently.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":null,"title":"“Shift Left” Isn’t What You Expected","type":"working-session","url":"/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/shift-left-isnt-what-you-expected/","weight":0,"wordcount":6989},{"authors":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2024/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1733870867,"objectID":"cd0f35e2a4124620cac34cbf7d3b34c1","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2024/","section":"sessions","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"2024 Summit Sessions","type":"sessions","url":"/sessions/2024/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"authors":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2024/mini-summits/Jun/banners/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1733870867,"objectID":"d77d4d715b335e7fd9db5de20e181b2a","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jun/banners/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jun/banners/","section":"sessions","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"2024 Summit Sessions","type":"sessions","url":"/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jun/banners/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"authors":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2024/mini-summits/Jan/DevSecOps/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":200,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733870867,"objectID":"6f16c48cad86985916ba0243a1d22b9f","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/devsecops/call-for-metrics/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/devsecops/call-for-metrics/","section":"sessions","summary":"\u003ciframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRrxYed72bXrKr1I2XnMzt6mbVycNr9qmZfyL3KQOPDu0n7DC9eglnx-akBO96IXA/embed?slide=id.p/embed?start=false\u0026loop=false\u0026delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-session\"\u003eAbout this session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;re excited to invite you to a dynamic discussion featuring Benji, Lars, Timo, and yourself, focusing on the strategies for collecting and showcasing DevSecOps metrics effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this session, we will delve into two distinct perspectives.

Models editable in developer IDEs and diffable in Git, which automatically derive risks including graphical diagrams and report generation with recommended mitigation actions.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":null,"title":"Agile Threat Modeling with Open-Source Tools","type":"working-session","url":"/sessions/2021/mini-summits/nov/threat-modeling/agile_threat_modeling_with_open_source_tools/","weight":0,"wordcount":167},{"authors":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"participant/organizers/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733870867,"objectID":"959bfb08f86a73bb6cc262900c873ede","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/participant/organizers/ahmed-mohamed/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/participant/organizers/ahmed-mohamed/","section":"participant","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Ahmed Mohamed","type":"participant","url":"/participant/organizers/ahmed-mohamed/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"authors":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2024/mini-summits/Jun/Threat Modeling/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733870867,"objectID":"9715c7a8f3121a01eb1d0a5cb77dc812","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jun/threat-modeling/ai-agents-for-cyber-threat-intelligence/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jun/threat-modeling/ai-agents-for-cyber-threat-intelligence/","section":"sessions","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-session\"\u003eAbout this session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn overview of the \u0026ldquo;roles\u0026rdquo; and tasks a team of AI Agents for basic Cyber Threat Intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":null,"title":"AI Agents for Cyber Threat Intelligence","type":"working-session","url":"/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jun/threat-modeling/ai-agents-for-cyber-threat-intelligence/","weight":0,"wordcount":20},{"authors":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2024/mini-summits/Dec/DevSecOps/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":200,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733870867,"objectID":"3a92468c758f501794c60e8eaa6ec19c","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/ai-and-appsec-are-we-finally-on-the-verge-of-the-big-breakthrough/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2024/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/ai-and-appsec-are-we-finally-on-the-verge-of-the-big-breakthrough/","section":"sessions","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-session\"\u003eAbout this session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAI and AppSec: are we finally on the verge of the big breakthrough?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn cybersecurity, AI has made significant advances, especially in threat detection, risk quantification and remediation automation.\nHowever, perhaps in Application Security (AppSec), it hasn\u0026rsquo;t fully reached its potential—yet. This talk will explore why the next big breakthrough in AI is deemed to potentially revolutionise threat modelling and security reviews, an area traditionally plagued by manual processes, high complexity, and slow adoption in fast-moving development environments.\nWe are at the tipping point where AI can understand code deeply enough to automate threat modelling, shifting threat modelling left and removing bottlenecks in the security review process. By using AI to derive data flows, identify threats and controls and continuously update threat models, we can potentially integrate security into the development lifecycle more effectively.\nJoin this session to discuss and discover how AI could potentially take threat modelling as code (and from code!) to the next level.\nKey discussion points:\u003c/p\u003e","tags":null,"title":"AI and AppSec: are we finally on the verge of the big breakthrough?","type":"working-session","url":"/sessions/2024/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/ai-and-appsec-are-we-finally-on-the-verge-of-the-big-breakthrough/","weight":0,"wordcount":186},{"authors":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2021/mini-summits/May/Misc/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733870867,"objectID":"d2ecb1a04be16591c2d15a525b07ac3e","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/may/misc/ai-ml-european-regulation/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2021/mini-summits/may/misc/ai-ml-european-regulation/","section":"sessions","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-session\"\u003eAbout this session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Panel discussion about the upcoming European regulation about AI/ML\u003c/p\u003e","tags":null,"title":"AI ML European regulation","type":"working-session","url":"/sessions/2021/mini-summits/may/misc/ai-ml-european-regulation/","weight":0,"wordcount":13},{"authors":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2024/mini-summits/Jan/Threat Modeling/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":200,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733870867,"objectID":"9120c01dd80f6f29f48e9e939ecffaf7","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/threat-modeling/ai-driven-threat-modelling-with-stride-gpt/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/threat-modeling/ai-driven-threat-modelling-with-stride-gpt/","section":"sessions","summary":"\u003ciframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQzOqKvccdSPsVcV3SuurY9EHobCiFw68oda2-pi8tVqz1K5F2Cg0e3X0OaLA0_Hg/embed?slide=id.p/embed?start=false\u0026loop=false\u0026delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-session\"\u003eAbout this session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;In this presentation, I will introduce STRIDE GPT, an AI-powered tool that leverages the latest OpenAI GPT models to generate comprehensive threat models and attack trees.

But with this shift comes a crucial question. \n \nAre we embracing the future of security, or are we relinquishing too much control?\n \nJoin me as I explore this timely topic, examining the potential of AI to transform security operations alongside the risks of relying too heavily on outsourced services. We’ll look at real-world examples of how AI-driven MDR can enhance threat detection, streamline security processes, and integrate with security pipelines. While also addressing concerns around data privacy, trust, and maintaining the right balance between human oversight and automation.\n \nThis session is aimed at those working in AI, DevOps and Cyber Security, sparking debate on whether outsourcing security really provides the protection we need or introduces new vulnerabilities.

a penetration tester. Having to then go back and fix the security bugs, 6 months to a year later, can be a pain. In this talk, you’ll learn common approaches of hacking your own apps and APIs (called offensive testing) from the get-go, so that you can learn how to respond (fixing vulnerabilities in your code) earlier in the software development life cycle.

Practitioners come to Cybersecurity from different backgrounds: development, system or network administration, compliance,\npentesting, and many others. Not everyone can think like an attacker. STRIDE is nice, deceitfully easy, incredibly noisy when applied by brute force, and sometimes just hard\nto apply when starting.

In this talk, Tim will touch on why we should be looking at nudge theory, what makes a good nudge and why, how to run a campaign to steer behaviours, and the potential impact this approach can have. He will also offer some takeaways on how to apply nudge theory, behavioural and learning science to your own awareness campaigns as you build up towards real-time nudges.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":null,"title":"In the moment nudges – What?

wish to. Combined with the power of Jupyter notebooks, we have stunning new ways to organize and visualize our data. Utlizing Jira’s API, secure authentication ensures that data doesn’t get into the wrong hands, and all the same flexible privilege options that we set in Jira will apply in Jupyter. In this session, you will see how with Python’s automation abilities, entire reports and dashboards can be built in clean and scalable ways, right from a simple notebook. You’ll see how graphs help visualize your workflow, and easily find what needs changing/improving. These changes can be implemented, and new nodes and edges can be added to our “map”, on a huge scale. We can neatly graph all of these Issues however we’d like - by their type, or by the link types they share with other issues, for example - or even store it in a clean Pandas dataframe. The consistency in Jira’s structure translates over seamlessly to code.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":null,"title":"Jira-Jupyter integration

Spoiler alert: it did not turn out to be so good but lessons learned help us improve the old legacy process into a more scalable and efficient one.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":null,"title":"Lessons learned from trying to create Architecture Diagrams As Code","type":"working-session","url":"/sessions/2022/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/lessons_learned_from_trying_to_creat_architecture_diagrams_as_code/","weight":0,"wordcount":122},{"authors":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2023/mini-summits/Oct/Governance/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":6600,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733870867,"objectID":"13734e11f4b68264941766afdd7ab5f9","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/governance/lets-go-on-a-data-with-vulnerabilities/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":31,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/governance/lets-go-on-a-data-with-vulnerabilities/","section":"sessions","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-session\"\u003eAbout this session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePosture and Data don’t lie - risk and fact-driven approach on posture management with deep dive into exploitability, reliability and the likelihood of exploitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"abstract\"\u003eAbstract\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePosture is the art of representing complex problems in simple risk-based visualization.

Hi. Welcome to this open security summit session in October 2023.\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;re joined by Simon Wardley and Marius Poskus. You know, has to\nbe one of my favorite topics, especially, I have to say, the thing I\u0026rsquo;ve learned\nthe most in the last 510 years that changed my perception. I have to add\nGen AI to that now. I have to say, Simon, but, you know, I still feel that it\u0026rsquo;s\none of those unexplored areas that has so much that we need to do to\nfigure out how to really use it. And it\u0026rsquo;s not perfect, but it\u0026rsquo;s way better than\na lot of the things that we use. So big fan on worldly maps. So, Simon, I\nknow you got some things you want to present to us. Why don\u0026rsquo;t we start\nthere and then we start the Q A out of it.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":null,"title":"Mapping Threat Intelligence: Enhancing Situational Awareness

Not every vulnerability is an intolerable risk. That’s where Sustainable Risk Triage (SRT) can come in.\nOversimplification gifted us a thousand tick-box compliance memes and arbitrary scoping decisions, often just based on spend.\nStarting at the top of a testing to-do list and just working downwards. Burn out, incidents, and audit points, because time and money ran out.\nThis session is about a middle way. Standardizing and simplifying conversations about achievable work and risk.\nCreating a defensible justification for de-scoping or deferral. Building hooks into next steps.\nLinking to available resource Whether for Schrems II, 3rd party assessment, or applying a better quality risk lens to vulnerability reports,\nthis session will look at how SRT works and how it could be tailored for different purposes\u003c/p\u003e","tags":null,"title":"Schrems II - Transfer risk triage and other adventures in scoping","type":"working-session","url":"/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/schrems-ii/schrems-ii---transfer-risk-triage-and-other-adventures-in-scoping/","weight":0,"wordcount":173},{"authors":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2021/mini-summits/Mar/DevSecOps/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":200,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733870867,"objectID":"2f1d864fbf57107a41d25cdc0b594cac","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/da-se-cluster-scanner-is-going-open-source/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/da-se-cluster-scanner-is-going-open-source/","section":"sessions","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-session\"\u003eAbout this session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cluster Scanner detects images in Kubernetes clusters and provides fast feedback based on security scans.\nAs a developer, the Cluster Scanner works out of the box.

The close relationship between a programmer, a machine, and code felt special.\nWe went to college and joined the workforce. We even launched our own startups and witnessed the transition of programming from one machine to many and eventually to cloud computing. This brought enormous complexities into our lives. Half of our effort now goes towards erecting and continuously maintaining complex \u0026ldquo;cloud environments\u0026rdquo; for our programs.\nEach environment consists of numerous layers of computing resources, each with its own trust model, often separated by network boundaries and overburdened with excessive configuration. Not only is this complexity slowing us down, but it is also prone to human errors, resulting in poor security.\nWe started the company because we found this mess with environments…unpleasant. We liked the simplicity of giving instructions to a computer better. Can we have that in the modern era of cloud computing?\nWe believe the answer is yes, but we have to let go of environments and leap into environment-free computing, i.e. fully embrace the promise of the cloud and treat the entire planet as a single, multi-tenant computer.

He explains\nthe four-step model for threat modeling and suggests using a structured approach from\nsystem architecture instead of relying on threat modeling tools. Louis then discusses a\nSaaS solution that supports grading systems in one state of the United States as their\ntarget for evaluation and identifies potential threats from students and teachers.\nThe transcript discusses the potential risks of cheating in an exam system and suggests\nways to prevent it. They discuss adding an admin to connect with the grading system and\ncreating architecture diagrams to understand where vulnerabilities may lie. The group also\ntalks about different components involved in the testing process, such as a Node JS API for\ndisplaying questions and a teacher UI for submitting them. They mention that short answer\nand essay questions will be manually graded by teachers before being added to the\nsystem\u0026rsquo;s reporting feature.\nThe speaker discusses creating documentation with dev teams and the value it adds to\nsecurity teams. They also discuss the Python Fast API, node JS UI, and student\nauthentication for a test-taking system. They emphasize the importance of not giving\nadmin rights to everything and improving readability in code by aligning arrows and\ngrouping related items together. The diagram serves as a basis for threat modeling.\nTwo individuals discuss the potential of creating graphs programmatically to scale their\nwork. They prefer the simplicity of graphics and want to create relationships between text\nand code bases that are created programmatically. The need for change is acknowledged,\nbut people often resist it due to time constraints. The speakers plan to make connections\nbetween UI and API less wide while acknowledging between UI and API less wide while acknowledging there is room for innovation in this area.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":null,"title":"Threat Modeling Kata Part 2","type":"working-session","url":"/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/threat-modeling-kata2/","weight":0,"wordcount":9453},{"authors":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"Starting a threat model can be challenging if you have never done it or if you face new technologies.

We also know from the shift-left movement that security issues can easily become technical debt when they aren’t squarely part of the feature delivery workflow. So how can we keep secure coding top of mind when it is often considered a “context switch” for developers working on features? In this talk, I’ll show how developers can use \u003cstrong\u003eruntime code analysis\u003c/strong\u003e to find security flaws as they code. Code analysis happens continually as developers work in their code editor, presenting security findings and interactive visual code maps in real time. For an additional layer of protection, code is analyzed again in CI. Examples of flaws that are detectable by runtime code analysis include: leaking customer data \u0026amp; secrets into log files; missing or improper authentication or authorization; unsafe data marshaling; unsafe handling of user-provided parameters. We will discuss how these specific examples of common flaws can creep into web apps, and I’ll show how runtime code analysis alerts developers to these problems while they are still in their flow and more likely to make prompt fixes. This talk will feature an open-source developer runtime analysis tool called AppMap that provides visualization and can be programmed to provide security analysis.

I\u0026rsquo;m finding it hard to understand the starting point of the threat model. Assuming that in a first stage you don\u0026rsquo;t use any tools to automate the process / parse code. You are simply using a whiteboard. My questions are:   \u003cbr\u003e\n1 - Do you (as a security engineer) call everyone into the same room (devs, devops, product owners maybe), and start asking the questions OR you start alone by understanding the maximum you can, and then create multiple meetings with different teams to improve your model ?   \u003cbr\u003e\n2 - Assuming you are threat modeling a huge web application, with a variety of dependencies on different teams / third parties.  Do you start by a really high level threat model of all journeys, or you pick one specific journey until you feel confortable with the final result ?   \u003cbr\u003e\n3 - A few times you mentioned you can zoom in on a specific process. How do you actually do this ? Does it mean you have a high level threat model and then multiple smal threat models ? are these all different files/ (edited)\u003c/p\u003e","tags":null,"title":"Wardley Maps First Aid","type":"user-session","url":"/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/wardley-maps/wardley-maps-introduction5/","weight":0,"wordcount":424},{"authors":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"TBD","dir":"sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/wardley-maps/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733870867,"objectID":"2b3e890c90acfd2589f2c58659569ce7","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/wardley-maps/wardley-maps-introduction4/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/wardley-maps/wardley-maps-introduction4/","section":"sessions","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Wardley Maps introduction","type":"training-session","url":"/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/wardley-maps/wardley-maps-introduction4/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"authors":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"TBD","dir":"sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/wardley-maps/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733870867,"objectID":"29aded317bca6554082b0d52ab23d9c4","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/wardley-maps/wardley-maps-thursday/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/wardley-maps/wardley-maps-thursday/","section":"sessions","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Wardley Maps Introduction","type":"training-session","url":"/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/wardley-maps/wardley-maps-thursday/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"authors":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2022/mini-summits/Dec/Governance/","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733870867,"objectID":"4c8207208cd245b4a5440175a1ef14ed","permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/dec/governance/we-need-secondorder-thinking-in-security/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2022/mini-summits/dec/governance/we-need-secondorder-thinking-in-security/","section":"sessions","summary":"\u003ciframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR9D-ayzrk0wT-wpzRo44fZh3_iI3wv5qO99j16VqEQ8ySNLLP1ZgFS_mo4H3eLuw/embed?slide=id.p/embed?start=false\u0026loop=false\u0026delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-session\"\u003eAbout this session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis session will be based on the theme of second-order thinking, which is a cognitive process that helps you look beyond the surface and identify underlying causes, effects, and relationships.
