Lars Hermerschmidt is Product Owner for Security Engineering at REWE digital. With his team he creates transparency for Software Security, shows teams how to improve, and coaches them to master new capabilities.
In the past, Lars tried to enable Security Champions with Security Belts in a non-DevOps organization. To fix the root cause, he ended up driving the DevOps transformation with insights from organizational sociology instead of building lots of tools into CI/CD pipelines.
