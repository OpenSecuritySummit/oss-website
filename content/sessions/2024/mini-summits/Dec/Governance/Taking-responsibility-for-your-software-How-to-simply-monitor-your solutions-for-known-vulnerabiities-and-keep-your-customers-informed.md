## About this session
Today's software solutions comprise of many different artefacts: Open source, own code, configurations, 3rd party licensed or produced tools, etc. Your customers tend to expect you to keep them informed about any issues arising from known vulnerabilities. Upcoming legal frameworks such as the European Cyber Resilience Act will even enforce this trend. 
It is essential to set up a solution allowing you to offer this information in an effortless and timely manner. This speech will introduce you to the challenges associated with this task and demonstrate how a solution might look like to cope with them.
