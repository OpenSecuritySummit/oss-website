## About this session
As cyber threats and bad actors become increasingly sophisticated, organisations are increasingly turning to AI-supported Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services to enhance their security. But with this shift comes a crucial question. 
 
Are we embracing the future of security, or are we relinquishing too much control?
 
Join me as I explore this timely topic, examining the potential of AI to transform security operations alongside the risks of relying too heavily on outsourced services. We’ll look at real-world examples of how AI-driven MDR can enhance threat detection, streamline security processes, and integrate with security pipelines. While also addressing concerns around data privacy, trust, and maintaining the right balance between human oversight and automation.
 
This session is aimed at those working in AI, DevOps and Cyber Security, sparking debate on whether outsourcing security really provides the protection we need or introduces new vulnerabilities. Don't miss this chance to engage in a discussion on the future of cybersecurity.
