## About this Session
In this session Dinis will share how he is using GenAI to transform the way security professionals consume and understand cybersecurity news and threat intelligence.

### The Why

The cybersecurity landscape generates massive amounts of data daily, creating several challenges:

- Information overload from multiple news sources and threat feeds
- Difficulty in identifying relevant threats for specific industries or roles
- Time-consuming manual analysis and correlation of security news
- Need for personalized insights based on user roles (CISO, SOC Analyst, Board Member)
- Lack of structured, actionable intelligence from raw news feeds

### The How 

In this session, we'll explore a practical FastAPI-based solution that uses GenAI to transform cybersecurity news consumption:

#### 1. Data Collection and Processing

- Automated collection from multiple security news sources
- Converting raw data into structured Python-friendly JSON schemas
- Efficient storage and retrieval using AWS S3
- Real-time updates and historical data management

#### 2. GenAI Analysis Layer

- Using LLMs to analyze and categorize security news
- Creating role-specific insights and summaries
- Threat level assessment and trending analysis
- Personalized recommendations based on user profiles

#### 3. Delivery and Integration

- FastAPI interface for flexible data access
- Tiered service levels from free to premium
- Integration with existing security tools
- Scalable architecture using AWS Lambda

### Key Innovation: Personalization Through GenAI

The platform leverages GenAI to provide customized insights through:
- **Role-Based Analysis**: Tailored summaries for executives, CISOs, and security teams
- **Industry Context**: Threat analysis specific to different sectors
- **Automated Categorization**: Smart classification of security incidents and trends
- **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time analysis of emerging threats
- **Custom Alerts**: Personalized notification based on user preferences

### Who Should Attend

This session is particularly valuable for:

- Security Teams and SOC Analysts
- CISOs and Security Leaders
- DevSecOps Practitioners
- Security Tool Developers
- Anyone interested in automated security intelligence

### Expected Outcomes

Participants will leave with:

- Understanding of how to build GenAI-powered security news feeds
- Practical implementation strategies using FastAPI and AWS
- Insights into personalization techniques using LLMs
- Ideas for integrating automated analysis into security workflows

Join us for this interactive session where we'll explore how GenAI is transforming security intelligence from overwhelming data streams into actionable, personalized insights.
