## About this session

Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has emerged as a leading approach to cybersecurity, emphasizing the principle of "never trust, always verify." This topic explores the concepts, benefits, and implementation strategies of ZTA in modern security landscapes.

## Outline
- Introduction to Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) and its principles.
- Exploring the limitations of traditional perimeter-based security models.
- Understanding the key components of ZTA, such as identity verification, micro-segmentation, and continuous monitoring.
- Implementing ZTA frameworks and best practices.
- Case studies and real-world examples of successful ZTA deployments.
