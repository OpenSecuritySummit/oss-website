## About this session
The aim of this presentation is to provide my strategic approach in dealing with unemployment, and the challenges associated with breaking into a cybersecurity role. Therefore, it's not my intention to focus on the hiring process or hiring manager or what the job market stats are saying but rather to help others take on a new of perspective in addressing or dealing this crisis.
