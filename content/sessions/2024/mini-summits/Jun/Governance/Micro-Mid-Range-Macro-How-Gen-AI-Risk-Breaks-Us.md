## About this session

Generative AI risk through a personal (Micro), company (Mid-Range), and Societal (Macro) lens... or at least an attempt at that. 

Sharing the journey, overwhelm, uncertainty, defeats and exploring why those challenges are their own strategic risks. Moving on to lessons learned about doable due diligence and trustworthy sources.
