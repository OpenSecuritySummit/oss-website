## About this session
Getting started with threat modeling can be daunting. Everyone has heard of STRIDE. Hearing from and using it are very different things. Very often you just don't know how or where to start. This is the purpose of a kata. Kata is a japanese word meaning "Form" and is used in martial arts for when a series of movements are trained to create muscle memory. This is a hands-on session, where you can collaborate to create a threat model of a system to be disclosed during the session.
