## About this session
"In this presentation, I will introduce STRIDE GPT, an AI-powered tool that leverages the latest OpenAI GPT models to generate comprehensive threat models and attack trees. Designed to enhance cybersecurity practices, STRIDE GPT also assists professionals by suggesting possible mitigations for identified threats, ensuring a proactive approach to security. 

Attendees will gain insights into the integration of AI with traditional threat modelling techniques, observe a live demonstration of the tool in action, and understand the benefits of incorporating AI-driven security solutions into their own practices. The session will also cover recent enhancements including Azure OpenAI Service integration, and will conclude with a discussion on future developments."
