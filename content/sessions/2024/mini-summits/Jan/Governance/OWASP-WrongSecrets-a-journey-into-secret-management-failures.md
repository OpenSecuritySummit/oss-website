## About this session
I am happy to turn it into a guided online workshop where people can do the challenges together with us, as we have online hosted versions.
I want to go over various examples of our project OWASP WrongSecrets (42 challenges by now), and dive into examples like secrets in LLM, and other mistakes made.
