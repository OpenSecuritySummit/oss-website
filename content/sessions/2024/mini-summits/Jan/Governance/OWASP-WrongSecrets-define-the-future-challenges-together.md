## About this session

In this working session, We would love to have an interactive discussion on new challenges that should be added to the platform based on the expertise of the people joining the session. To get an idea, we first want to go over various exercises and then, together, think about what challenges or features we should add to the platform.
The presentation/working session will give insight to secrets management and its pitfalls, and will, based on the synergy of working together, help people to grow faster.
