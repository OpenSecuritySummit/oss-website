## About the session:
"In this talk I will address a critical aspect of all organisational resilience mainly cybersecurity and how to convey the criticality of the solutions, expenditure and long-term investment to senior management. In an era where digital landscapes are evolving at an unprecedented pace, the need to fortify our defences against cyber threats has never been more urgent. Turning the tide in our favour requires a concerted effort, and a key component of this effort lies in convincing senior management and ownership to invest substantially in cybersecurity measures.
 
We will cover during this talk how to articulate the tangible risks that our organization faces in the cyber realm in a way that meets the language of the business owners and senior leaders, removing the normal approach of “tech washing” and hit your business leaders with solid, facts , figures and the irrefutable facts that will make gaining the consistent level of investment possible.
 
We then move on to how you demonstrate the potential impact through concrete examples and case studies will help senior leaders understand the gravity of the situation.
 
We then move onto how it's crucial to highlight the evolving regulatory landscape. Governments and industry bodies are increasingly stringent about data protection, and non-compliance can result in hefty fines. Investing in cybersecurity is not just a proactive measure; it's a legal obligation that safeguards our organization from severe financial penalties and legal consequences. Emphasizing the cost of non-compliance and the potential legal ramifications will underscore the importance of cybersecurity as a strategic imperative.
 
From here the talk track moves into how, we must present cybersecurity not merely as an expense but as an investment that yields long-term benefits. A robust cybersecurity infrastructure enhances our operational efficiency, protects intellectual property, and fosters customer trust. By showcasing how cybersecurity measures contribute to a positive return on investment (ROI), we can shift the narrative from a necessary expenditure to a strategic initiative that fortifies our competitive advantage.
 
Our closing aim is to help those in the room build a vocabulary and approach to garner support from senior management, it's essential to speak their language. Translate technical jargon into business metrics, illustrating how cybersecurity investments align with overarching business goals. Emphasize the potential for innovation and growth that a secure digital environment can foster positioning cybersecurity as an enabler rather than a hindrance.
 
We then will lastly, cover cultivate a culture of cybersecurity awareness throughout the organization. Train employees to be the first line of defence against cyber threats, turning them into assets rather than vulnerabilities. A well-informed and vigilant workforce not only reduces the risk of successful cyber-attacks but also showcases a commitment to cybersecurity that resonates with stakeholders. Having the whole business talk cyber-security and push this to the senior leaders and how doing so strengthens your resolve and will leverage the spend you need.
 
In conclusion our talk , “Turning the tide” favours robust cybersecurity and how this requires a strategic and persuasive approach. By presenting the risks, emphasizing legal obligations, showcasing long-term benefits, aligning with business goals, and fostering a culture of awareness, we can convince senior management and ownership to make the necessary investments. Together, we can build a resilient organization that thrives in the face of evolving cyber threats."
