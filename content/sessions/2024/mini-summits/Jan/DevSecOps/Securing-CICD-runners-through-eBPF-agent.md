## About this session
CI/CD pipelines are complex environments. This complexity requires methodical comprehensive reviews to secure the entire stack. Often a company may lack the time, specialist security knowledge, and people needed to secure their CI/CD pipelines. Realising these facts; cyberattacks targeting CI/CD pipelines has been gaining momentum, and attackers increasingly understand that build pipelines are highly-privileged targets with a substantial attack surface. In this presentation, we will share some of our observation through showing different flavours of attack on possible development pipelines, and introduce a tool to detect them.
