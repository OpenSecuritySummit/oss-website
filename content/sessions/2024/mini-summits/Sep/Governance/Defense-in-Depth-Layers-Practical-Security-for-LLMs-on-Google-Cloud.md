## About this session
This presentation examines the evolving security challenges associated with LLMs. We'll delve into common prompt injection attacks (Live Demo) and explore effective mitigation strategies using a defense in depth approach. You'll learn how to leverage DLP, Natural Language API, and responsible AI safety filters to build a secure foundation for LLM applications.
