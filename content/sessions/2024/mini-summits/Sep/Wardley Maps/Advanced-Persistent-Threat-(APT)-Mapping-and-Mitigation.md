## About this session
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) involve sophisticated and prolonged attacks aimed at compromising organizations. This topic focuses on techniques for mapping APT attack vectors and patterns to improve detection and mitigation efforts. It covers tools and strategies for identifying APT activities and responding to them effectively. Panelists can discuss real-world examples of APT mapping and response, sharing insights into how organizations have defended against these advanced threats.

## Outline:
- Understanding Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and their tactics
- Techniques for mapping APT attack vectors and patterns
- Tools and strategies for detecting and mitigating APTs
- Real-world examples of APT mapping and response
