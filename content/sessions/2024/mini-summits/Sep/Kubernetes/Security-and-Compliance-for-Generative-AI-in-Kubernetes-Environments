## About this session
Generative AI models, especially those handling sensitive data, pose unique security and compliance challenges. This topic focuses on best practices for securing Generative AI models and data in Kubernetes environments. It explores Kubernetes security features, such as network policies and role-based access control (RBAC), and how they can be applied to protect AI workloads. Panelists can discuss compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and share examples of effective security strategies and compliance measures.

## Outline
- Overview of scaling challenges for Generative AI applications
- Kubernetes features for scaling (e.g., Horizontal Pod Autoscaling, Cluster Autoscaler)
- Strategies for managing scaling efficiently
- Case studies of scaling Generative AI applications
