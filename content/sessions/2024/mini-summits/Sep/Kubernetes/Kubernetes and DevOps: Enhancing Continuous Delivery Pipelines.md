## About this session
 Kubernetes plays a significant role in modern Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines by enabling scalable and reliable application deployment. This topic explores how Kubernetes can be integrated with CI/CD tools like Jenkins and GitLab to streamline build and deployment processes. It covers best practices for creating and managing CD pipelines, including automated testing and deployment strategies. Panelists can discuss case studies where Kubernetes has improved CD processes and share insights on optimizing delivery pipelines.

 ## Outline:
Role of Kubernetes in Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines
Integrating Kubernetes with CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD)
Best practices for building and deploying applications using Kubernetes
Case studies of optimized CD pipelines
