## About this Session
In the age of generative AI, the focus often shifts to content creation, but there is a powerful and often overlooked application: using GenAI to understand and transform existing content. This session, led by Dinis Cruz, will delve into how organizations can harness GenAI to analyze, refine, and optimize content, making it more relevant, accessible, and actionable without generating new material from scratch.

**Key Focus Areas:**

- **Content Analysis and Insights:** Explore how GenAI can be used to dissect and understand large volumes of text, extracting key insights and identifying patterns that can inform decision-making and strategic planning.

- **Content Transformation and Adaptation:** Learn how to utilize GenAI to transform content—whether it's restructuring, summarizing, translating, or adapting for different audiences—ensuring that existing materials are more impactful and better aligned with your goals.

- **Enhancing Content Accessibility:** Discover methods for using GenAI to improve the accessibility of content, such as generating simpler versions, creating summaries for quick comprehension, or transforming content formats to suit various needs and preferences.

- **Leveraging GenAI for Compliance and Consistency:** Understand how GenAI can be employed to audit and adjust content for compliance with regulatory standards, brand consistency, and organizational guidelines, reducing the risk of errors and misalignment.

- **Case Studies and Real-World Applications:** Gain insights from real-world examples where organizations have successfully used GenAI to transform their content strategies, enhancing efficiency, engagement, and the overall user experience.

## Who Should Attend
This session is ideal for content managers, digital strategists, marketing professionals, compliance officers, and anyone interested in leveraging GenAI to optimize and transform existing content rather than creating new material. Whether you're looking to improve content accessibility, compliance, or overall quality, this session will provide valuable insights and practical approaches.
