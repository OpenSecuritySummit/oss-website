19:31:35	 From James Bore : The idea of laying out 'here are your risk scenarios, make a choice' sounds very familiar.
19:51:45	 From Carey Lening : "Tutanota uses a standardized, hybrid method consisting of a symmetrical and an asymmetrical algorithm - AES with a length of 128 bit and RSA with 2048 bit.[19][20][dead link][non-primary source needed] To external recipients who do not use Tutanota a notification is sent with a link to a temporary Tutanota account. After entering a previously exchanged password, the recipient can read the message and reply end-to-end encrypted"
19:52:48	 From Carey Lening : Also, womp womp : "German e2e encrypted email provider Tutanota has been ordered by a regional court to develop a function that allows it to monitor an individual account."
