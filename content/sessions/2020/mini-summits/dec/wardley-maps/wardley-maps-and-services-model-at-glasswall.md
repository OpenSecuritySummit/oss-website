description  : We'll give people a quick tour of the Wardley Maps & Doctrine assessment created at Glasswall over the past few months, and touch on challenges & the road ahead.  The bulk of the session will be a panel discussion digging into the way maps were used and the planned services model (e.g. cell-based structure).
