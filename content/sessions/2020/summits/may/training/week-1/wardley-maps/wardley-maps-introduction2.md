### Notable logs from the chat during the session

14:19:19     From Wallaby Curtis : In relation to amount of usage?    \
14:21:57     From Michele Chubirka : Yes, finally someone can explain Wardley maps \
14:35:12     From Tomas Pilvelis : why is power not at the top, reason I say is because surely without something like power being key to tea is it not higher in the value axis?  \
14:37:20     From Luke Robbertse : Anchor is at the top. Anchor being the item under review in map. Then you read the map top down. In this case being 'cup of tea' is the item being broken down?   \
14:56:15     From Wallaby Curtis : Someone has sound on.   \
