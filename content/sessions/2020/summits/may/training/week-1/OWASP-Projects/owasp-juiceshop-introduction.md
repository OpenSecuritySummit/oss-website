In this **introduction session to OWASP Juice Shop**

- we will take a quick tour through the OWASP flagship project that
  claims to be "probably the most sophisticated vulnerable web
  application!"

- Starting with a "happy path" shopping tour we will then learn what
  security flaws lurk beneath the shiny web UI surface!
- You will also learn about the CTF support, hacking instructor scripts,
  tutorial mode, dos and don'ts and some technical background of the
  project!

_Note: The theming and integration capabilities as well as the
MultiJuicer project will only be covered very briefly, as they both have
their own user sessions during the main summit week!
