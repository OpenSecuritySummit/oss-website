### About this talk:

Supply Chain Attacks are becoming increasingly widespread as cyber criminals seek to access sensitive data and systems through less secure third parties. In such attacks, the victim is not the ultimate target of the attack, but rather a stepping stone to other larger networks. In this talk, I will present an overview of enterprise cyber risk and supply chain attacks and delve into various attack patterns, specific cases, lessons learned, challenges and mitigations.
