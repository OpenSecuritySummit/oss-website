### About this talk:

In this session, we'll do threat modelling for using a cloud funtion as a detonation chamber. 
A detonation  chamber as defined by NIST, is an ideal capability for providing vulnerability shielding. They allow for a thorough analysis of objects entering an environment to determine if they are malicious or contain exploit code targeting a known vulnerability or an unknown/zero-day vulnerability.
