## About this session
This will be a walkthrough of our team’s recently released open-source developer toolset for privacy. I’ll show how you can make things like privacy risk assessment an automated part of the CI Pipeline, and share some thoughts about how we think privacy is treading the same path that AppSec laid in recent years.
