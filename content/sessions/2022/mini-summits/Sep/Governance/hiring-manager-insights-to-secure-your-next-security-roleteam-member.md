## About this session
This is an insider guide on the hiring process with tips for applicants and hiring managers. 
It will cover what is going through a hiring manager’s mind, what things will maximise your chances of success on both sides, and how to improve your interview performance. 
We’ll also cover how we tweaked and tuned our hiring to accelerate the process and secure great applicants in a competitive landscape, and how we shifted to building a team around capabilities we could hire, rather than chasing unicorns!
