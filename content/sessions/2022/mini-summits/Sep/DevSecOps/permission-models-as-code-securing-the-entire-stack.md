## About this session
In this presentation, we will discuss a number of topics that will provide an insight into how permission models as code can be used to secure products from top to bottom - from infrastructure up to the application layer.

The following topics will be discussed:
- Why permissions are hard to build and maintain
- The different options for permission models
- Policy as Code
- Generating policy as code (Rego) - with Permit.io's low-code policy editor
- Applying policies to Kubernetes infrastructure
- Applying policies to the application layer
