description  :
With security teams being vastly outnumbered many organizations have responded to this challenge with different program scaling methods, including building security champions programs. Which leads us to questions; How does a security champions program work? How do you select your champions? And once you have them, what do you DO with them? 

This session will teach you;
	•	How to attract the right people to your program
	•	What and how to train them
	•	How to engage them, and turn them into security advocates
	•	What do delegate and what NOT to delegate
	•	What to communicate, how often and to who
	•	How to motivate them
	•	How to build an AMAZING security champion program

Recipe for success; recruit, engage, teach, recognize, reward, don’t stop.
