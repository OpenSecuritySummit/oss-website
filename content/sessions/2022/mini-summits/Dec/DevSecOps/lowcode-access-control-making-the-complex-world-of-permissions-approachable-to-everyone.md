## About this session
Access control is hard, and building and rebuilding your homebrew solution is even harder. Building more granular permissions that dive deeper than admin and non-admin, or even simple RBAC is tedious, and a solution like Permit exists that abstracts away from the complexity, and nails a solid foundation for building very complex permissions that are scalable and fast to implement.
