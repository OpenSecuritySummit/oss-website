A LinuxÂ® container is a set of 1 or more processes that are isolated from the rest of the system. That is available in Linux/Unix (kernel) from decade. In this topic, will explore the layers, isolation, privileges, environments/resource utilization etc for a Linux process and use the same as container/isolated env.
