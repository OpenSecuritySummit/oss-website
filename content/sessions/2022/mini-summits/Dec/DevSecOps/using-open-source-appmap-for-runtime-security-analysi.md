## About this session
In this workshop. We will show how new users can use AppMap, an open source runtime code analysis tool, to analyze [RailsGoat](https://github.com/land-of-apps/railsgoat) a vulnerable Ruby on Rails application.  We'll show a step my step process for users to get Railsgoat running and also an introduction to VS Code and AppMap.  In addition we'll show:

* Opening projects in VS Code
* Setup and Run Railsgoat locally via bundler
* Install AppMap into VS Code & Ruby Libraries
* Run tests and use Runtime Analysis to identify vulnerabilities
* Navigate AppMaps: Dependency View,  Trace View and Sequence Diagrams
* Fix vulnerabilities and use Runtime Analysis to confirm fixes
* Compare Auto-Generate Sequence Diagrams with before/after fixes
* Generate OpenAPI Documentation
* Ingest OpenAPI Documentation into OWASP Zap for targeted Web Application Scanning (DAST)

From here we'll investigate security findings that can only be picked up within a runtime analysis of the software.
