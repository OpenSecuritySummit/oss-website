## About this session
CVSS, CVE, Vulnerabilities and the land of broken dreams, Stop your tiers and start with a risk approach and contextual view of vulnerabilities

## Abstract 
Vulnerability tooling is increasing, security advisories are faster, and teams are leaner. Have we lost the battle of vulnerabilities, is shift left and is security everyone’s problem working? 
We present a risk and cyber quantification view on vulnerabilities across cloud, application, and infrastructure addressing modern approaches to cybersecurity from the point of view of the product security team. 
We will walk several use cases that shows how context, prioritization, probability and impact analysis can be used to improve which vulnerability to solve first.
