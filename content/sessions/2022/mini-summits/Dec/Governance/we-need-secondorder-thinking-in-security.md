## About this session
This session will be based on the theme of second-order thinking, which is a cognitive process that helps you look beyond the surface and identify underlying causes, effects, and relationships. The goal is to develop insights that are deeper than what you would get by looking only at the immediate cause and effect.

Deepak will discuss how security professionals can apply second-order thinking to their work to improve their ability to identify and address risks more effectively.
