## About this session

This session will focus on how the multiple O2 Platform tools you can use today

### O2 Platform

The O2 platform represents a new paradigm for how to perform, document and distribute Web Application security tests and scripts.

O2 is designed to Automate Security Consultants Knowledge and Workflows and to Allow non-security experts to access and consume Security Knowledge

In practice the O2 Platform is a collection of Open Source modules that help Web Application Security Professionals to maximize their efforts and quickly obtain high visibility into an application's security profile.
