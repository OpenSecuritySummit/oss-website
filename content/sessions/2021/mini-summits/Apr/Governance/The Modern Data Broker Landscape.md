## About this session

Who is aggregating data on us? An easier question might be: Who is not? Explore a new dataset on Brokers. We'll discuss definitions, classification systems, 
expansion into new data streams and business models, visualizations of the industry, bad actors, a new Data Stewardship Index, risks of selling and sharing deidentified data, 
potential solutions, and regulation.
