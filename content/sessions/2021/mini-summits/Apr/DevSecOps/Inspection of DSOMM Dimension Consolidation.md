## About this session
This is a hands-on workshop, your experience is very welcome.

In this workshop we will think in small groups and present outcomes regarding questions like
* Introduction of more activities like Web Application Firewalls (your experience is needed here)
* Comparation of OWASP DSOMM with [DevSecOps Maturity Model - A Team centric view - Public Request for comments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/117qhaw7wEJ465_wLgv2e4C1FgcIiYWVOw2A3KZEiBl8/edit#gid=2096996119), specially security empowerment and take aways
* Discussion of priorization of one dimension (maybe voted by the audiance)
* Enhancement of maturity levels (e.g. 5 instead of 4) to provide a better priorization
* Mapping to other models like [Gartner DevSecOps model/loop](https://github.com/wurstbrot/DevSecOps-MaturityModel/issues/14) and expected outcome/value
* Gathering of requirements for the application

Please do not hesitate to bring your own questions.
