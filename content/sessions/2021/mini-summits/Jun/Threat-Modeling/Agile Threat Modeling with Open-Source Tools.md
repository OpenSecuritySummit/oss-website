## About this session

If we can build software in a reliable, reproducible and quick way at any time using Pipeline-as-Code and have also automated security scans as part of it, how can we quickly capture the risk landscape of agile projects to ensure we didn’t miss anything important? Traditionally, this happens in workshops with lots of discussion and model work on the whiteboard with boxes, lines, and clouds. It’s just a pity that in some agile projects it stops there: Instead of a living model, a slowly but surely eroding artifact is created, while the agile project evolves at a faster pace. In order to counteract this process of decay, something has to be done continuously, something like “Threat-Model-as-Code” in the DevSecOps sense. See in this talk the ideas behind this approach: Agile developer-friendly threat modeling right from within the IDE using open-source tools. Models editable in developer IDEs and diffable in Git, which automatically derive risks including graphical diagrams and report generation with recommended mitigation actions.
