## About this session
A tabletop-esque interactive session pitting 2-3 groups against one another.
Whether you are in the IT & production department, among the executives or a part of the regulatory bodies, your job is to determine how to move forward to ship a new IoT product rapidly and securely, without awaking the regulatory bodies' wrath.
Bring your party forward along the allotted timeline and influence other parties decisions in order to ship your product in time. But your actions and mitigations might fail, because you may fall prey to the cast of the die! You may have to sacrifice things in order to recoup development time, and this may lead to problems.
Can you bring the project to fruition? Or will you be making sure it never sees the light of day?
