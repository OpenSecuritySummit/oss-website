## About this session
In this 1 hour session Lianne will discuss:

By 2025 it is estimated $10.5 trillion will be lost to cyber criminals.

Hacking humans is a very lucrative business. Social engineering is one of the easiest and most effective ways to access a secure system. Cyber criminals know this, and they are increasingly leaning on the research and techniques of the social science disciplines to leverage the human element into letting them into our lives, our businesses and our bank accounts. Yet, while the security industry is always striving to be ‘one step ahead’ of the criminals in terms of technical capabilities, it often neglects the need to consider the very social nature of hacking.

As the threat continues to grow, how can security practitioners increase security awareness and build up our resilience to unite against malicious actors looking to leverage what makes us human against us? This talk argues that we do the same, and use what makes us human to make us stronger. 

This discussion puts people and social science at the centre of the solution with real-life examples and experiences from a SOC analyst turned cyber anthropologist. Lianne will discuss how this has been successfully applied in organisations to change the perceptions and responses to security threats, ultimately leading to an intrinsic security culture that works in collaborating to make the estate more secure.
