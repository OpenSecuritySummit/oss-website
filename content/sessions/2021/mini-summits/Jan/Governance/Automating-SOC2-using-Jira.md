## About this session
To find our more about how we are going to run this project, you can read this blog to get a view of our approach, as we explain it in our drive to find new talent to onboard and join for the project: https://medium.com/glasswall-engineering/were-hiring-any-security-and-compliance-people-out-there-to-help-us-achieve-soc-2-and-then-some-10e0d15571fc

- SOC 2 Criterias and Controls are represented in Jira - and linked - so we have a graph behind the scences
- Jupyter notebooks are generating reports based on all Jira issues
- Google sheets and slides are generated from report data
- All work we do, all callatoral we create, all process documentation and evidence requirements will be linked to all controls on Jira
- We want to scale this
- We want to automate
- We want continuous compliance
