## About this session
In a cloud-native, agile environment with hundreds of services operating at scale for products, security needs to be comprehensive, data driven and focuses on risk reduction. How does a lean team of security engineers achieve this with an emphasis on trust and partnership? In this presentation, I'll cover my learnings as a security engineer working on security design and guidance at scale. The talk will mainly focus on three things: 1. Automation for security design reviews 2. Partnership with developers and product teams 3. Partnership with security engineering teams for timely involvement

We will also discuss how to measure success and overall developer experience.
