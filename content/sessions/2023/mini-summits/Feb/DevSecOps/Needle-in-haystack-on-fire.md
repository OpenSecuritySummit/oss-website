## About this session
- The panel discussion on modern challenges of vulnerability management, entitled "Needles in the Haystack", will be led by Francesco Cipollone. The panel will bring together heads of application security and security engineers to discuss the difficulties and practical solutions for managing vulnerabilities in today's rapidly evolving software landscape. The panel will explore the current landscape of vulnerability management and the reasons why vulnerabilities are becoming increasingly hard to manage.

- Francesco Cipollone and the panel will delve into the problems of the software development life cycle (SDLC) and modern enterprise software, which are further compounded by the divide between operations and development teams. The panel will provide a solution to these challenges by introducing a contextualized framework for vulnerability management, separating but unifying operations and development teams, and focusing on metrics that matter such as Service Level Agreements (SLA) and Objectives and Key Results (OKR).

- The panel will also discuss the "funnel of salvation," a roadmap for organizations to follow in order to effectively manage their vulnerabilities and secure their software systems. By focusing on practical solutions, the panel will help organizations to find the needle in the haystack of vulnerabilities and secure their software systems. The panel, led by Francesco Cipollone, will provide valuable insights for organizations looking to tackle the challenges of vulnerability management and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving software landscape.
