## About this session
When learning threat modeling, there is a need for examples that are well thought out. In hacker summer camp 2022 there was a competition with a very comprehensive system description to find possible threats and evaluate them. The system described allows users to order food and have it delivered by a drone.
In this session we'll analyze the system: draw diagrams using the C4 modeling technique (https://c4model.com/) to understand what are we building. Then we'll start looking for anything that could go wrong and what we could do about it.
It will be an interactive session where audience participation is actively encouraged.
