## About this session
Enterprise vendors continue to discover new phishing scams, and insert these new techniques into phishing simulations. Is this reasonable and the most effective use of our users time? If AI is so smart why are we wasting users time, when there is evidence suggests that users don't have time to be so watchful and careful? Shouldn't we stop stressing out our users?
