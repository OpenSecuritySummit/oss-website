## About the session:
"We support battle-hardened production applications every day, but do we hold ourselves accountable to the same standard with our own tools? Learn how to protect the tools that help us to get our jobs done, while accelerating our ability to connect systems together using programmable Zero Trust Networking technology powered by OpenZiti. 
The OpenZiti project is an open source initiative focused on bringing Zero Trust to any application. The project gives developers the capability of monitoring anything, anywhere, and doesn’t compromise your solution’s security to do so. No open firewall holes. No exposed web hooks. All private and secure using a zero trust overlay that’s both comprehensive and free."
