## About this session
"
Shifting left had success, shifting right and adding context is hot as the number of vulnerabilities pre-flight in an SDLC is piling up. Find your path in this modern, challenging.  The talk walks trough a new approach on risk base approach on vulnerabilities called shift smart.
