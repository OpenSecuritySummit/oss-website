## About this session
This topic focuses on integrating SemGrep into the CI/CD pipeline for automated code quality and security checks. Panelists will discuss the practical implementation of SemGrep in various stages of the pipeline, its impact on reducing vulnerabilities and improving overall code quality, and strategies for handling false positives.

### Outline:
- Importance of integrating static analysis into the CI/CD pipeline
- Configuring SemGrep for automated code scanning in different pipeline stages
- Strategies for managing false positives and reducing noise
- Collaborating with development and security teams for effective implementation
- Real-world examples and best practices of SemGrep integration in CI/CD workflows
