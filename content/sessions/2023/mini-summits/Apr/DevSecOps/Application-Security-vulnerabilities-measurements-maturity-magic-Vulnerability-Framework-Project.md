## Session Transcript:
Dinis Cruz - 00:05
Hi, welcome to this Open Security Summit session, the first one in April
2023. We start with a bang with Francesco. She's going to covers us on
building Zealand application security programs. Over to you, Francesco.

Francesco Cipollone - 00:21
Thank you very much, Denis. Some technical hiccups, but we hear we're
ready to go. Thank you very much for everyone for coming and joining
today, the presentation. We're going to go through of intro on why we
created the Vulnerability Management program and how to build resilient
application security, cloud security and vulnerability management
program. This is a community effort that we kick off last year and has
been developed over the course of the years with several industry
members, vendors participating in building the Vulnerability Management
Framework project, that is an open source project sponsored by several
vendors, but completely vendor neutral. I'm here today to show you the
latest developments. It's free for all to develop and participate and
contribute. We built this for a specific reason because there was no much
guidance for how to solve issue other than when we found the issue. There
was a lot of guidance around secure development, lifecycle maturity
elements.

Francesco Cipollone - 01:27
After you find the issue, what do you do with it? How do you triage? Who
do you involve? How do all the different little pieces that form mature
application security program, robulnerbility management program fit all
together from detection to action and measurements and KPI, how do all
these elements fit together? I think with the latest evolution of the industry,
with risk based vulnerability management, the application security and
cloud security coming together into a single CNAP, this was very much
needed and hence why we put it together. So, without further ado, let's
continue, and I hope you guys excuse me, because I'm going to use an
insane amount of jokes and an insane amount of memes, because
cybersecurity and application security in particular is half enough. Let's
start with a smile, let's talk about with a smile. So let's joke about it. On
the first jokes, on the traditional slide, on the presenter, this can never fail,
this can never miss.

Francesco Cipollone - 02:40
My name is Francesco Cipolone for who doesn't know me. Frank for
friends. I'm the CEO and founder of Phoenix security startup here in
London and Europe that revolves around software security, maturity
aggregation, prioritization, but fundamentally my mission is to prevent
burnout and make everybody live a happy life on security. Why? My ethos
is because I've been through this, I've been through several vulnerability
management transformation. I felt the pain of actually triaging, dealing
with tons of tickets, dealing with tons of frustrated developer and security
professional executive that couldn't get into the same page. I've been
doing a lot of transformation from several financial institution to telcos.
I've seen a lot of environment doing this. My question to you is, can we
scale security to make it more enjoyable? A little bit more fun. Yeah, the
answer is yes, we can. Vulnerability management framework is the first
part.

Francesco Cipollone - 03:46
So what is a framework? Well, traditionally it has been around scanning
everything that you can find possibly. This is definitely one part of a
vulnerability management framework or detection of issue from software
to vulnerabilities infrastructure, operating system and all the way down to
the cloud. It's not only that, it's what you do with these things. How do
you mature, how do you define who needs to what, when and to which
level? This is all the purpose endpoint around the vulnerability
management level. Today, as I mentioned, we're going to talk about the
problem and where are we and why are we here and why is this
framework really needed across the industry? Why it was very much
vocalized on why it was needed, the issue and human cost of actually
triaging and fixing vulnerability manually that has exacerbated in the
recent year. I wanted to bring some data and metrics together with some
studies that have been available in the industry and then we're going to
dive deeper on the modern security development lifecycle or security
development framework and focusing then on deep diving in the
vulnerability management framework.

Francesco Cipollone - 05:01
I'm going to stop a certain section for everybody to ask question and then
we're going to wrap up at the end with why the Q and A. Let's start with a
fundamental question why do we need a vulnerability management
framework or why do we need some guidance or why do we need
vulnerability overall or managing those vulnerabilities? Well, let's start
with the more obvious thing that everybody knows, but I think it's useful
to reiterate attackers are getting faster and faster with chat GPT, new
attack methods, script keydis and new developments. Attacker are getting
faster at exploiting vulnerability from recent studies for critical
vulnerability, three to 15 days from declaration time is the exploit stage at
scale. That's probably one of the elements that I want to hone in and
probably hammer during this presentation is the at scale part that has
been particularly hard in the recent years because fundamentally attacker
are getting clever and clever on orchestrating and scheduling attacks at
scale using well known vulnerabilities that can be automated and scripted.

Francesco Cipollone - 06:19
The resolution time has been dramatically squished, especially for things
externally facing, but also we've seen things that are also internally facing
in an organization being at risk in some level of stage. This is of a diagram
of how the history have changed from 2013 where the average resolution
time and exploit time, sorry, was around 80 days for a critical vulnerability
from the date of discovery to all the way down to 2021 and forward where
the vulnerability resolution time is around 15 days. Three to 15 days
roughly right now is the average and some statistics around average time
that this one of the recent Garner studies, but Kolis hasn't released similar
studies. Ponemon Institute have released a similar studies on how quickly
are we fixing on average vulnerabilities across the board and where
should we really focus. For me this feels like we are defending
organization with 2013 mindset and defense, but having 2023 level
attackers and this is only going to get worse.

Francesco Cipollone - 07:37
I know I'm reiterating the obvious, but things are getting faster quickly if
you enable me the job. One input breaches has been proven to be derived
from direct vulnerability exploitation of things that are externally facing.
The time is now to actually think in a bit more clever way. I want to maybe
reiterate as well the fact that right now we're focusing on really taking
vulnerability and everything that we find from different security scanners
and I've listed some of them at the bottom of the pyramid where we should
really focus in of a clever way to actually do that. That is contextual, that
is CTI based exploitation, that is looking at things that really matters and
stuff that really needs fixing. The challenge is a security professional. We
all say we should be there and the question is how do we get there? In
order to get to the Moon, we need a step by step approach and hence why
we created the vulnerability management framework to create that level
of guidance.

Francesco Cipollone - 08:53
Because not everybody needs to be around the Moon. Maybe in your
organization, maybe you can be well off just looking at what are the
exploits available in the one. Because even with just that you will shave off
an enormous amount of vulnerability, at least from a software and
operating system perspective and container perspective, it will reduce
drastically the amount of vulnerability that you will look at. From a
software perspective it's roughly the same amount. If you look at
contextualization, roughly 10% of vulnerability are the only one that really
need attention. If you bring additional context and intelligence, it will be
even less. Without intelligence, without context, without any information,
where are we standing? This is the modern security development lifecycle
after an organization have implemented maybe one, two or three scanners
and you try to dump information in a security data lake or you might look
at different security dashboards, you have tons of criticals from different
scanners, completely uncontextualized, completely unrelated together.

Francesco Cipollone - 10:04
The question is where do you start, how should fix things and what is the
most urgent? To me, when I started this life in application, security and
vulnerability management triaging at scale, I was overhelmed and to me it
felt like finding a needle in a haystack. A haystack was on fire and
everybody was screaming around me. Scaling this to organization, to
large enterprise organization was particularly challenging. How are we
fixing it so far? What are the methods and approach that we're fixing it so
far? Well, we put a security team in front of a huge backlog of
vulnerability to triage across all the landscape that we have, plus looking
at cyber threat, intelligence and then trying to find the vulnerability
matters most and being that rake that fundamentally shifted and reduced
the number of vulnerability to a minimal level, to the 10%. But that's not
scalable.

Francesco Cipollone - 11:08
And that leads to burnout. Shall I mention what happened to lawful J or
spring for Shell or any other if you want us? One of my good friend Alyssa
says the superstar vulnerability that every hands on deck, everything needs
to be resolved in every kind of repository or in any kind of library or in any
kind of operating system, which Paulina was across the board. A very well
known Microsoft vulnerability log for J was the other well known one that
happened during Christmas last year. We all kind of remember and I guess
have PTSD out of log for J. Do every lock for Jenny to be resolved?
Probably not, but we have the capability to say which one should we
resolve? Which particular instance of lock for J is actually behind a buff,
behind a compensating control? Probably not. The usually narrative that
happens is the boats hear something on the news say do we have this
problem, shall we fix everything?

Francesco Cipollone - 12:15
All hands on deck. The opposite element that happens is when security
team says security is everybody's responsibility. What that really means
usually is checking to development team all the vulnerability across the
board and that results in an enormous backlog of things that might get
overlooked or might not get overlooked. Development team work and job
is not to look at every vulnerability that any kind of tool speed out.
Actually probably that's the receipt for failure. What that generally
speaking, end up being is us as a security team running, scanning solution
and then checking over vulnerability to development team and screaming
at them why can't you be secure? The business screams at us why can't
you be secure? The reason to do so is because security team in any
organization that I've been dealing with, when you're lucky, you have 15
application security people for a specific amount of range.

Francesco Cipollone - 13:23
Usually it's very few of us in an organization and is really difficult to
triage be on every single vulnerability and be in every single scrum team or
development team. Hence we give all this responsibility to the developer
hoping that they have more time than us to actually develop. This is the
good road to burnout for both aspect and both element of the table. Both
the security team and the development team. The developer don't want to
deal with tons of vulnerability, the security team doesn't want to be in
every single scrum looking at every single ticket because that's not
scalable and average. This was last year we have 570 more developer than
a security person. An average amount I would say, of security to
development in a small organization is one security person for every 50
devs. That if you take a nine hour vulnerability triage versus a 48 minutes
time that a security professional can dedicate to a development team to
analyze a vulnerability or to sit down to an architectural review or
retrospective, there is a huge disparity.

Francesco Cipollone - 14:43
It takes quite a lot of time to recognize what to do with a specific
vulnerability in the context of where that vulnerability happens. If we take
you to the extreme of any large organization that we traditionally deal
with, the development community keeps on growing while the security
community doesn't keep pace. We have roughly one to 201 security
professional to 200 developers. The number of hours and the number of
times that the development community can dedicate the security
community can dedicate to the development community is up to 10
minutes per team per week. That means that we either ignore a bunch of
application and we just focus on maybe two or three that are critical and
we dedicate the right time, but we need to know which one are actually
critical and which one are the repeat that are critical. This is why I say
this is the right road to burnout and I've been there, I feel a pain, I've done
that.

Francesco Cipollone - 15:44
The only solution is probably a mention and a shout out to a team of sage
and this is Tanya. Jank has recently shared this and I really like the idea of
sorry for the low resolution image, was a last Windows edition but shifting
everywhere. We've been talking about shift left and shift right and shift left
mean bringing security very early stage in a security development lifecycle.
We're going touch in a second. Shift right means fundamentally still
looking at vulnerability and what happened in production and there is not
either or both of them needs to be there. Also shift up and shift down
means involving the business and having the business involved with us.
Only in that way we can create a good collaboration across the team
between product owner, between the business development and security.
We're missing one person in the room or a couple of person in the room,
the auditor and regulators.

Francesco Cipollone - 16:44
Unfortunately there is a lot of regulation unfortunately there is a lot of
regulation around vulnerability management. More coming from the
European for the new Cyber Resiliency Act and from the recent bomb and
all the conversation of the Cyber Resiliency Act from the US. Also there
are mandate and statement of how many women are beating how quickly
you should look at things. Unfortunately those are statics and static
information, static declaration. They don't look at prioritization, they
don't look at maturity, they don't look at where you are. They just ask you,
where are the vulnerability, have you fixed the report? Have you done
these things? Without a proper vulnerability centralization system and a
mature program around it you spend that time and effort of security or
development running around colliding report and I'm going to make this
available through PDF. We're not going to go promise across every single
regulation that there is around vulnerability management but there are
more and more statements around vulnerability management that are
coming out and more that will come out.

Francesco Cipollone - 17:59
I want to make a quick postal and take a step back. What is the real
objective of security? Because right now we've been down the rabbit hole
of oh my God, there are vulnerabilities everywhere oh my God, we don't
have enough time, oh my God, we don't have collaboration and there is
new regulation. This is not the purpose of the presentation, it's not to
cause panic but it's really to describe the landscape where we are and our
thinking of where we should go and what is the real objective. The real
objective is not to fix all the vulnerability altogether but to involve the
business to define what and where we should be at a specific point in time.
Where should we be from a risk perspective and risk for who knows? Me, I
love risk because risk enable us as a security professional and
development to communicate with the business and having the business
communicate to us.

Francesco Cipollone - 18:57
Also it's really important because enable us to describe where does a
business want us to be, against whom we should defend, against which
level do we want to deploy our security team and not fixing all the
vulnerabilities? Also because fixing vulnerability, as you can see here on
the right, is just one of the elements of a vulnerability management
program like implementing security control, influencing culture,
implementing things in a shift left way, implementing fundamentally
controls at the very early stage like threat modeling or guardrails at the
very early stage. All of those things forms part of a single but united
vulnerability management framework that enables you resilience
vulnerability management and application security program of work that
enables you to operate at a risk level of an organization that an
organization fund. I wanted to reiterate vulnerability in itself are not risk
vulnerability on an asset described by a threat that has a particular
probability of an exploit to happen and a particular impact.

Francesco Cipollone - 20:12
This is really what risk is and our objective is to reduce the risk service in
the attack surface of the security team and operate at the level that the
business is comfortable with. All this is done with vulnerability
management, the framework risk management patching, fixing,
implementing control, implementing a culture and so on. I probably spoke
25 minutes about the vulnerability management framework without
showing you what is the vulnerability management framework. Drum rolls
and let's show so this is the current published version of the vulnerability
management framework is divided between five levels, actually six with
level zero. There is a lot of debate around the team on creating a level
zero or not. It was a good way to show that this is when you don't do
anything. Usually organization operates a maturity level one. The
framework in itself is divided between detection, aggregation and
management, prioritization action and measurement.

Francesco Cipollone - 21:20
Those are the various pillars of the framework with a maturity level across
each one of them. Now we're going to go and analyze fundamentally
where vulnerability come from and how normally an application security
program is put together, and then come back to the vulnerability
management framework on every single vertical of this and dive deeper.
That you have more context around where do we start and where do we
end, and why is the framework structure in this way? So let's start with
the first part. What is a traditional or what is a modern application
security program of work? I like to represent this in this particular way
where you have at the central part the three core elements of an
application security program of work. This can be also described as a
vulnerability management program where you have more less security
design and secure build but you have more tests and secure operate.

Francesco Cipollone - 22:24
It is applicable on both way as well as cloud security where you have
element of design, build and test with infrastructure as a code and
creation of environment. On top of that there is governance and open size,
risk management and risk management framework, cultural change and
education. We're not here to talk about all of that area. I would like to
focus on the central part because it's a central part that generates
fundamentally issue vulnerability and also enable us to mitigate. We
generate vulnerability and I know this is a bit huge to digest, so I'm going
to go slowly on this. This is how a modern security pipeline with all the
controls and all the scanning technology is created. You have on top
fundamentally automated scanning solution and at the bottom process
and procedures that are enabling the process and enabling security
professional to operate. You have a left and a right and the left is the
concept of shift left.

Francesco Cipollone - 23:31
You build and when you test and the definition of the dotted line is when
you deploy in either dev test or production. Definitely speaking, what we
refer here is production. The left is where I'd like to say you have fast
triage and fast operational fast fixing. This is where you implement
security technology and security tool like code Analysis or Sea secure
library checks, where if an issue is get thrown at the developer or at you,
as a security professional SRE, you can quickly make a decision either to
fix it because you have something in your IDE in where you develop the
code that flat red and says there is an issue here or a potential issue here,
or there is a library. When you build the code or when you commit a
specific segment, this is where I call fast reage now you can make a
decision can I fix it or is this going to cause more issue around the code or
is this going to cause a number of incidents?

Francesco Cipollone - 24:43
This is where I call Fast reaction, fix it now or put in the backlog and then
revisit it at next print or retrospective. This is some quick decision that you
can make and then the right part is where things happen in a more
consistent way. When logo J happened, local J didn't appear in a library
where were writing code, but appeared everywhere. Either if the library
was deployed, if the particular piece of software was deployed in
production, was a Java virtual machine, or image deployed in production,
or if you take polina happen not in a development environment, but
happening, production happening, laptops happen everywhere, exchange
Vulnerabilities, the latest one that happened everywhere. This is where we
need to monitor fundamentally production and we need to monitor what
happened in an operational and production environment. This is a shift
right where we look at where vulnerability happened and they
traditionally don't have somebody on the keyboard at that particular point
in time with the exception maybe of the sock.

Francesco Cipollone - 25:49
This is where fundamentally you have either complex triage or complex
impact assessment of a vulnerability and you need to decide how to tackle
this backlog. This is the backlog of fundamentally vulnerability that we
need to tackle and decide who needs to do what where. This is the
challenging part of the vulnerability management triage and why a lot of
the time we created the framework. So what is the process of triage? As
we said, I like to see it in a three step process where you discover things
from various scanners, either in a fast fixed way or in an operational way,
scan it, aggregate all this finding in a central place and then triage
deciding which one is important. In the process of triage there is the
correlation and the prioritization process where you look at which things
should be addressed first. Comes the fun part, finding the right team
where this vulnerability needs to be addressed or the right repository, or
the right people, even if you're lucky that particular application is
maintained by a specific set of people and then chasing and following up,
maybe raising an exception, maybe that's a false positive.

Francesco Cipollone - 27:14
This is the part that is enormously time consuming. Also the triage
correlation and prioritization can be enormously time consuming but this
can be automated in a certain way. Chasing, following up, alerting
reporting can be gamified if you develop a security champion program,
but it's definitely time consuming. Also planning, following up, resolve and
making sure that the vulnerability was actually resolved is the other action
part kind of sits at the border. I would like to maybe look at also the other
side of the world where we have to deal as a Blue Team, as a Purple Team
with a lot of politics, deciding what to fix, when not to fix, what time to
allocate. On the other side you have attackers that still have their own
organizational structure they need to discover, they need to identify a
good target to attack prioritizing maybe which vulnerability to attack
first.

Francesco Cipollone - 28:16
Then do it. They don't have to deal with who need to fix what. Yes, they
have right now their own development tool and they're becoming
especially for ransomware software house but that's not the operational
people, the one that goes in attack. They don't have that time or that
expenditure of time to spend on dealing with politics. Well us as a defender
we have to and this is a process that tend to be linear from our resolution
time. We scan issues, we visualize sorry, we scan issues, we aggregate, we
visualize, we triage, we remediate, we resolve and we go back to the
original step to rescan and verify this is the traditional process and how it
happens sometimes I used to think that this was linear, it's actually not. I
think it more now as a funnel where on top of the funnel you have two
kind of source of information.

Francesco Cipollone - 29:23
You have everything that happened in your software and everything that
happened in your environment, infrastructure, container, cloud and so on.
You aggregate all this information in one single place on multiple places.
You prioritize, you deduplicate and you contextualize each of these
process enable you to screen and reduce the number of vulnerability or
things that you should look at. That's the purpose of the panel to then
create a streamlined approach of things that needs to be fixed. That's how
you operationalize and scale a traditional chaotic and slow vulnerability
management program across different parts of the organization into a
more sausage factory and resolution factory. This is, if you think about it,
vulnerability are just bugs are just defect. Development team have gone
quite good at scheduling work to address defect and bugs, maybe doing
retrospective and then continuing resolving. The more we go forward and
the forward we go, the more everything is going to be engineering
structured and at the pace of an engineering sprint.

Francesco Cipollone - 30:34
If we align Security sausage Creation Factory and issue Creation Factory
into the structure and process of a development team, then we're winning
because we ensure that the development team can then or the engineering
team can then schedule work in a consistent way and focusing always on
what's more important, but also having process and procedures to support
them. Now this in the easy part and airport for who is listening of
Structuring and shadowing work. How do we report on all this? Because
KPI is the other very important part and aspect of reporting either to the
business or to the virus team and if we choose the wrong KPI, this is how
we end up looking. This is how I remember looking when I was talking just
about vulnerability to any community that wasn't dealing with
vulnerability. If I was talking about a specific APD group that was
attacking a specific vulnerability that was behind not behind a firewall or
not behind a WAF and hence had the probability of getting exploited of x
amount of time or board member they would just get completely lost.

Francesco Cipollone - 31:55
What the heck are you talking about? And they were right. They're dealing
with business unit, they're dealing with line of business. They're dealing
with country. They're dealing with a lot of risk. Security is not in their day
to day dealing, not at least at their detail level. Well, if I talk about risk
position or amount of money that an organization could lose or the
reputational damage maybe that an organization could lose to a
developer, an engineer will say, what do I need to do in Next Sprint? I
understand the impact, I understand that this is potentially bad. What is
the stuff that I need to do so that's the two aspect or the two pyramid
elements of reporting that I would like to mention that is at technology
level we have specific KPI or specific objective. If you use the system of
OKR, that matters and that are really useful.

Francesco Cipollone - 32:54
How many vulnerability do you have? What is the time to fix vulnerability
meantime to resolution or what is the mean time to open? All these
elements really work well at this level, which is the most critical asset,
which is the most critical vulnerability. The higher you go in the chain, the
more abstract those reports needs to be. We need to aggregate the number
of vulnerability. Maybe we need to convert them in risk. Yes, because
enable us to communicate with the business and create scorecards in a
very consistent way per application, per business unit, per organization.
And they all interrelate together. The higher we go, the more abstract
those element becomes. The lower we go those reporting, the more detail
they need to become. It's really important to keep them linked together.
We can't have the risk. Level to be in a spreadsheet that express risks that
are not totally correlated to number of vulnerability that we have or the
state of the control that we have on a specific system.

Francesco Cipollone - 33:58
Because then when we have a complete disconnect of the objective of an
organization saying, I want to be at risk zero. An engineering community
says or a security community that says, if you want to be at risk, really
zero, you need to deploy a small army or a small country budget to
actually be at that risk. Well, if you express the number of vulnerability, the
number of. Risk of each application and you enable the business to say, I
want to operate at this risk level. You can quantify and you can schedule
work in a consistent way and in a way that is aligned with their
expectation. That's where you create reporting and expectation and you
enable the business to operate at the risk level where they want in
engineering and security to collaborate and create that triangle of
collaboration that is shift up, shift down, shift left and shift right.

Francesco Cipollone - 34:51
So shift everywhere. All right, so back on the vulnerability management
framework. We're going to dive deeper on each of these sections and
describe which one, which of the various vertical they are. Right now the
vulnerability management framework is at version 1.2 and we're already
working at 1.5. Enriching a lot of the detection, prioritization action and a
few others element that enable you to assess in an easier way and also
scope in a more way. The detection part is specifically important for
dealing where you find things and we kind of divided them in an evolving
way where you have a maturity one and two, maybe the beginning of an
application security scanning or an infrastructure scanning or a Pen test
scanning. That's usually where an organization tend to start, depending if
you're a more software oriented house or you are less software oriented
house. Maturity three and four is where you start getting more into the
automation and adding additional scanners.

Francesco Cipollone - 36:00
Maturity four is where you have the full part of scanner that traditionally
a software house or a modern enterprise has. That is API scanning, sea
manual testing, Pen testing, maybe a bug bunty program and so on and so
forth. Maturity level five is where you start automating some of this
control, putting them inside the pipeline, operationalizing scanning, it at
scale. Again, you don't necessarily need to be a level five, you need to ask
your organization which level do you want to be? That enables you to plan
step by step every year. How do you evolve your scanning capability? The
following step is aggregation and deduplication from a lot of those
scanners. The more scanner you have, the more noise those generate. The
more you need to reduce the number of noise by either consolidating all
these problems and really laser focusing every team that really matters
and we're going to cover that in action and voting on focusing every
development team on just the vulnerability that matters more and on the
backlog of the vulnerability that affect them.

Francesco Cipollone - 37:11
What is the point of raising the ticket with the development team of a
vulnerability that is sitting on an application that they can't support that
create noise, that create confusion. The more scanning you have, the more
likely is that a data lake that you create all the information that you
present to a team becomes noisy. This is the nature of it. This is where a
lot of organizations lack because security at the lake is a new concept and
security aggregation is a new thing. Traditionally you start by aggregating
vulnerability and maybe represent them, maybe represent the vulnerability
by criticality. It's this critical, how many critical do we have, how many
vulnerability from a low medium perspective do we have? On maturity two
and three you start enriching and aggregating things by business unit, by
maybe application. That's where you start getting more into the concept
of enrichment and helps as well.

Francesco Cipollone - 38:15
The next stage is the prioritization and then four and five is where you
have automations. Here is where fundamentally you need more heavy
work on deduplication and removing duplicated from every application or
every scanner or aggregating things together. For example, scanner that
scans an IP address externally and scanner that scans an IP address
internally. Or maybe libraries are not being used or maybe different
repositories that are being scanned in different and multiple scanner. This
is traditionally what happened with a lot of organizational maturity three
or four that they may be grow by acquisition and you have different
business units and different teams that then have their own scanning
capability. Maybe you have an ACA tool in one organization and an ICA
tool in another organization and that fragmentation doesn't enable you to
operate in a control way. That is where aggregation deduplication really
comes handy.

Francesco Cipollone - 39:12
Prioritization is the holy grail, is the most important aspect of things. The
prioritization aspect operates on bumping up and down vulnerability
based on different elements. Traditional organization in maturity one and
two operates around SLA or what needs to be solved, at which specific
time for a specific criticality, where the organization gets a bit better and
clever as maturity Two and three, where things get better, where you start
using cyber threat intelligence, possibly at scale to operationalize and
really prioritize the vulnerability matters more. There are several
framework like EBSS exploit, prediction scoring, that is an open source
available threat feed to at least look at the infrastructure. We're working
on CWE level software vulnerability to at least prioritize the vulnerability
that are attacked in the world that are more likely to get exploited in the
next 30 days. A maturity four and five is where you start moving towards a
more risk based approach, a more contextualization approach, and
bringing in really the concept of where an asset is and how business
critical is a specific set of assets or an application or a business service.

Francesco Cipollone - 40:39
This is where you get a bit better and you start aligning fundamentally in a
more business way, in a more risk way, in a more modern way. Your
vulnerability management program or your application security
management program, the action part is what you do to then scale down
and action on the vulnerability. Traditionally this approach in maturity one
and two is reactive react on the vulnerability that gets raised to you from
a few vulnerability perspective. On maturity two and three, you start
reviewing a backlog because maybe you have a backlog of vulnerability
that you have available and you start maturity three and four, start
tackling down the backlog in a maybe more intelligent way or more
proactive way. Four and five is where you start getting really proactive
and looking at insight and statistics. There are tons of open source tooling
available, not just Phoenix Security, but there is Open Bus and Defect
Dojo, for example.

Francesco Cipollone - 41:39
They give you a lot of statistic and insights on what is the most common
vulnerability that you have or what is the most common issue that you
have or which one is the most vulnerable asset. That's in maturity four and
five where you start getting the security team more proactively operating
and tackling at scale vulnerability. Netflix, for example, is really good at
this, creating paved way, removing vulnerability altogether or classes of
vulnerability altogether. The last part but not least important is the
measurement. This is probably the area that is being developed the most
and in this particular version of the framework is least developed because
we've been debated on what are the KPI and what are the measurements
that make sense at every stage and every organization have different
metrics and prospective. This has been highly debated on what are the
metrics that really matters from an operational perspective versus an
application security perspective.

Francesco Cipollone - 42:38
We have a consensus around, for example, the maturity one where
traditionally vulnerability are being raised by criticality. You move
reporting by SLA or number of vulnerability per business unit per SLA,
things that are inside and outside a service level agreement. You move in
maturity three where you have more business concept. Remember,
maturity levels are also marked together, so you don't necessarily need to
be at specific stage. If you don't have any concept of business context, you
can do SLA based on risk, you can do SLA based on specific other
elements. The value stages of this framework are also interlinked together.
In maturity five, probably some of this metric will be strickled down on
different level because meantime to resolution build versus fix, that is, how
many user stories do you have versus how many stories you don't have.
They probably are more common in maturity three and four.

Francesco Cipollone - 43:46
We're still debating on where to move these things, this particular area of
the framework as well, the debate is around the element that we saw
before, that is who look at various metrics and reporting. Specific KPI
needs to be also mapped to specific persona. If you're a business persona,
you probably want to look at specific APIs that are based on risk. If you're
not a business persona, if you're a technical persona or a security person
or a developer, you probably want to look at KPI that makes sense to you,
like how many stories do we need to build versus how many things do we
need to fix and metrics like that. There is a whole debate, we just done a
whole debate one of a form that I love the most that is less full security
around this specific subject to our discussion this. Without further ado, let
me wrap up probably the conversation that is we've been hearing and
talking about shift left, shift right, shift up and shift down.

Francesco Cipollone - 44:54
We've been talking about going to the moon without the step necessary to
get there. I would like to recap that a mature application security program
or a vulnerability management program or a cloud security program. For
me, they're interchangeable. They all deal with defects and they all deal
with defects. When you write code, that is in the left and when you run
things that is in the right and aggregating and consolidating all these
issues in a central place so that you can triage in a bit better way, manage
exception and create executive reports but also an engagement with the
development team cleaning up those information. All of this is supported
by the vulnerability management framework from detection left and right
to measurements to action. This is what a modern observation security
program works. If you haven't seen as well, there is a blog where a couple
of these images are taken.

Francesco Cipollone - 45:53
This betterupcycle.com is a fantastic resource for a lot of these additional
information together with us. Wrapping up vulnerability management can
be daunting and at the beginning for me was overwhelming the amount of
tasks and people that I needed to talk with. So identify where you identify
the issue. This is my recommendation decide the maturity level, where you
are and where you want to be. Collaborate and sit down with team and
define which team can move faster and which team can move slower. Talk
with the business, shift up and shift down. Get commitment from the
business and then talk with the development and security. Shift left and
shift right for me and implement the vulnerability management program
and framework. Give us feedback as well. Use the framework, give us
feedback, let us know what you think and let us know how to fix. I would
like to leave you with fundamental message.

Francesco Cipollone - 46:57
I created this and we created this framework and we created Phoenix as
well to prevent burnout. Don't just be complacent and just deal with
criticality their vulnerability because this leads to burnout. I would like to
mention as well that we have all of this documented in application security
vulnerabilities management framework is available for everybody to
download for free. We are making as well a collaborative project and
integration with Tson in the upcoming future. Shout out to us a little bit.
This is what we do operationally. Phoenix security does fundamentally
vulnerability management triage prioritization enable you to communicate
from a risk perspective. Close pitch parentheses, but we are partner as
well with OS. If you have an OS account, please. You have access to both
the AbSec part of it but the full platform for free. This is our commitment
to the community as well. On the subject of metrics, we have dedicated a
whole book written with the community and few other leaders in
application security that is available to download for free.

Francesco Cipollone - 48:15
SLA dead and Long leave SLA and a data driven approach on application
security. So we are probably few minutes away. I'd like to thank you
everyone for your time that you dedicate to me. I'd like to open the floor
to questions.

Dinis Cruz - 48:39
Yeah, man, this was great. It's like a master class on application security,
man. Sorry. Yeah, I was just checking with Adam. I think again, let's
create lots of small little nuggets of this because I think it's a really good
one. I'm not seeing any questions here.

Francesco Cipollone - 49:03
Did I shock everyone questions?

Dinis Cruz - 49:06
I think we wowed everybody. And the slides. I keep getting better, man,
every session. You're making some really amazing slides that I feel like I
just want to use them and do all my presentations.

Francesco Cipollone - 49:20
Feel free to use it. This is my commitment to the community. It has a
copyright, but feel free to use a lot of these slides of vulnerability
management framework. Some of this stuff is freely available to use. It
cool. I'm going not no question.

Dinis Cruz - 49:43
No, I don't think so. So I think we're good.

Francesco Cipollone - 49:45
All right, good stuff. Thank you everyone. Please remember to download
the framework and use it and give us feedback. Hopefully.
