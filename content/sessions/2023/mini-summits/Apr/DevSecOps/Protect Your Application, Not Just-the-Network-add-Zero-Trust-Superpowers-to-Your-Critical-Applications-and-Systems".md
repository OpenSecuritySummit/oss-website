## About the session:
Applications are the new edge and zero trust is the security industryâ€™s latest hot buzzword. Most solutions are closed source and try to protect the network. Securing the network isn't enough. Adding zero trust directly to your app is the future and the best way to keep your mission-critical systems secure and running. Zero trust overlay networking can be embedded into your application making the security of the network entirely irrelevant - the isolated application will have zero trust of the internet, local and host OS network.
