## About the session:
"Securing your database is incredibly important and easy to get wrong. We can't go a week without hearing about another database leak. What if we could access these databases using strong identities and zero-trust principles?

That's exactly what you can do quickly and easily using OpenZiti's zero trust JDBC. Not only can you add the OpenZiti JDBC directly to your app for zero-trust access, but you can also add it to your favorite SQL editors and access the DB over a zero-trust overlay network with no VPN. Who wants to turn on the VPN just to run a query?"
