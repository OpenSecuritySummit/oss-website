## Session Transcript
Dinis Cruz

Hi. Welcome to this open security summit session in April 2023. We're
going to be talking about security vendors operating model and hopefully
set up the beginning of a nice, again, community infrastructure for us to
have a much more productive relationship with a lot of the vendors and
really ratchet up right where the states or where we currently are. So I'm
Denis. I'm the chief scientist of Glasswall. I run a lot of stuff in the
Summit. I'm also the CEO of Holland and Barrett, so also been CISO for
quite a long time. Nick, quick introduction from you. Yeah.

Nick Harris

Nick Harris, deputy CISO and Head of Cybersecurity here at Holland and
Barrett. So work very closely with Dennis.

Dinis Cruz

Yeah, me and Nick work really close together. There's a number of stuff
that we kind of have done in the past, and I just want to very quickly walk
through it because I feel that sets the stage. There's a really cool
presentation that Dan Cutbird has been done recently, I think, with Black
Hat Europe, where he was really talking about the state of the vendors
and the state of the especially security vendors and how we're really not in
a good place. And I kind of agree with him. Right. I also agree that we
probably need a bit more regulation in our industry, but I feel at the
moment, like the quality and the service and basically what we get from a
lot of our vendors is not where we need to be. Given the fact that with the
new GPT and the Chat GPT and the evolution of that into the products, a
lot of the vendors we really need to ratchet up.

Dinis Cruz

In terms of the quality, what they provide, the service they do, I really feel
that the time is right for the best vendors to actually really come on top
and we're creating an economic model that really rewards them. There's a
couple of two parts in here. One of the elements is that what we really
need to see a lot more. This is now a call for a lot of other CSVs, a lot of
other companies that we need to be working together much closely. Me
and Ants did a bunch of sessions in the last Summit. This is actually
started in 2008, right? Incredibly. Right. So we did a session in 2022. We
actually talked about the CDC, and I actually got the slides here. Right.
This idea is about creating these collective defense clusters that initially
started in 17 and 2018 in one of the first Summits.

Dinis Cruz

Incredibly tom flies. Right. We did this session in there and we did a follow
up, and again, there was some good stuff. Ironically, again, sometimes if
you don't put energy, things don't really happen. Right. Me and him
actually created some really nice documents about basically thinking and
how would we set this up. The original idea of the defense cluster was
almost the article is it article nine or whatever that article is article five of
NATO, which is actually this day quite relevant, right? Also that was the
idea of creating relationships within companies that for example, if one
gets really attacked, all the other companies will go to the defense. It's
almost like try to pull the resources that exist across multiple companies
and really help each other out. This works really well when you have
companies of reasonable size of maturity. It doesn't work if you have a
Microsoft GitHub type of security team with a much smaller company.

Dinis Cruz

What works is when you have security teams of certain level of maturity, it
basically band together and really leverage that. We put a bit of thinking
of this and there's almost like this agreement that we can do. The
importance again of doing this stuff like this is that you need to make
some of these formal agreements within companies. And it was about
improving sharing. We talk about some of the confidential data that we
share, some of the resources, the pool, the trade intelligence. One of the
things we actually end up doing a bit is also vendor knowledge because
this already happens unofficially, right? A lot of the systems, a lot of
security professionals would talk to their friends, their colleagues, their
mentors and I think we need to really formalize this a lot better, right? We
could even have some share funds, share research, share sharing
resources.

Dinis Cruz

That was kind of the idea, right, that we could play and there's already
some good stuff out there, right? So there's already some good forums.
This was kind of the creation of these semi structured groups of
companies that then come together and band together to really leverage
this. If you then apply this, for example, to the not just to the response, but
for the vendor and make sure that we get the best of the products that we
have, one of the things that we're kind of thinking is, and this is something
I shared with some of the vendors that we have, is that basically what you
really want is have this model where we are one team, right? A lot of
vendors sell a product and then almost like they don't care until they care.
You can really see a big difference between the moment of the sale and the
moment of the reset of the renewal.

Dinis Cruz

In the middle it's they go, well here's the product, you make the mode out
of it, right? So I think that is very wrong. The other one is that you really
want a massive degrees of openness within the system, right? I still don't
feel that we have the right level of openness and sharing of information.
Right? The other one is, again, we want to be a partner, not a client,
right? That means that we want to give a lot more to the vendors, right?
We want to give them much more feedback. We want to have shared
communication platforms. It's amazing how many vendors still don't have
an easy place to file bugs, file issues. Even something as big simple as to
collaborate is not there, right? The other one is that we invest in our
vendors. We spend the time, we really invest. We really spend the time to
make the most out of it and collaborate in the error.

Dinis Cruz

Again, there needs to be a two way street. It's super critical that every
vendor at any moment in time really shows the value, right, that we need
internally, but also that we can use a lot more of the products. This is the
thing I really like. At any moment in time, we should be either buying more
or reducing the spend on a product until we reach a state of balance. This
should not be a one year or whatever contract. We should be adjusting the
spend according to what we use. We can go up, but also we can go down
because that's a healthy relationship, right? Which kind of takes us to the
model that, again, companies like AWS already do. I think a lot of the
industry needs to move again too, which is we should be paying by usage,
not block of licenses. We really should be doing this again, if you're in here
in the right side of history, if you're not, you might still have clients and
people who pay you money, right?

Dinis Cruz

Definitely your customers are not really going to like a lot of the stuff
that's happening, right? We really need for me, it's almost like the key
area, right? Again, automation and scale creating graphs focus on the
value proposition. To be honest, I would actually now add here, make sure
that tools like Chat GPT or GPT, like technology can consume you because
that's literally the next evolution. Again, people's personal technology help
us to make the most out of it. And a worldly map, right? The thing that
also I found funny, right? Nick here got a nice taste of worldly maps when
he was joining, right? He created really great worldly maps which actually
have a session in the Summit. It's like every vendor should give us a
worldly map to say, where do you add value? Like, what are you
commoditizing, what are the things that you're enabling?

Dinis Cruz

What are you moving the needs? Even if it's like, oh, we got this custom
build that we're making, it almost as a product. Are we improving this
today or there? Right? They really should be giving that across the board.
So Nick, some comments on this, right? I just drop a whole bunch of stuff
in there, right? Where do you want to start on your views on this.

Nick Harris

Yeah, I think it's about disrupting the model. I think there's a momentum
growing that vendors have possibly got quite comfortable that we go
through this onboarding, we give them security assessments, we go
through POVs, we scorecard them, we choose the rest one, the CSM that
works with you and you have monthly calls and it's all going well, and
then you come back for renewal. Well, I think does that work? Really?
We're spending all this money, we're putting all the hard work in. They
provided good products, definitely. There's a lot of R and D that's gone
into the back end. Are they truly working with us as partners to make best
use of it? Some vendors better than others, but a lot will be first on your
back if you've gone over the license count. There'll be chew ups and true
ups, which is fine, that's the business model.

Nick Harris

But where's the true down? If we pay for 2000 licenses and we're only
consuming 1000 because the adoption hasn't gone well and we need more
time with a partner to drive that adoption, where's the true down to say,
well, we paid for that, but we're not getting any use from this? I think
there's a massive shift that needs to happen in partners getting beyond this
customer Success Manager, the Customer Relationship Manager,
whatever they call themselves, and properly partnering that they don't just
give you the product at the front door and go over to you tell me how it's
going. They actually drive the adoption and facilitate that. It's not about
professional services and kind of extra stuff. It's just that it's about really
getting the best out of the whole platform. Product, service, whatever
they're providing, the partnership really needs to link up. Less
transactional, more collaborative.

Dinis Cruz

I agree. Right. I think one of the areas to facilitate that is, I think for a lot
of companies to start to collaborate because it's easy to do sometimes
those moves when you're dealing with one company. If you're now dealing
with a band of companies, or a group, or a cluster, or a sector, or a
government right. Or a set of regulations that defines how you interact
with industries, then that's a much stronger proposition.

Nick Harris

Yeah. There are a couple of bits in there. The first one is probably a real
stretch, but how amazing would this be? Under your CDC concept, it's not
the mobile phone provider I have, but there are mobile phone providers
which, if you as the brother, don't use your full contracts, your sister can
use it. Why can't if we've paid for 2000 licenses to use 1000, another
company that we're partnered with can consume the rest and we can then
negotiate around that and they can send some others our way where we've
missed. About kind of spreading in an exchange way, some of that
licensing and really therefore kind of evening out. Maybe they've overused
in one underneath the other. Actually we could benefit with some of that.
How can we bitcoin anyway, or transact and pass those licenses around
where they're just not being used?

Dinis Cruz

Yeah. No, I like that. Right. Because that's having that value added of a
cluster of companies, right, that some negotiate well. You could even think
like when you have for example, groups of companies, you can have the
same structure. If you have even investor groups that they all are on this
or certain companies who are aligned on specific objectives where they all
care about a particular thing, where we once get hit, everybody else
suffers. It makes sense to be leveraging this, right, even cross company
arrangements. Like you said, you can have a case where you do an
agreement that actually addresses multiple companies and then people
can use licenses right, in the most effective way.

Nick Harris

Yeah, definitely. That once it is a very good point as well. We talked
haven't we, about, I guess peacetime activity, how vendors can work with
us. Peacetime non article five. We're in NATO and we're kind of getting
the best of the tool and driving the right adoption and adoption just
beyond the security adoption to the business, whether it's in the Accept
Team or DevOps or in HR, whatever it might be. What about when it gets
to wartime? I think we've talked about this previously, where are the
vendors when the incident happens? They need to be pulled in part of the
incident response team. It's not just that we are using that platform to do
some investigation, whatever it might be. Where are they saying, did you
could use your platform for this? I'm going to bring my engineer in from
the vendor and be part of your sponsoring to get the best out of the
platform and really drive in on that incident to help us out.

Nick Harris

If we need to sort the professional services out or whatever it is after the
event, then we'll do that. But when it's proper crisis, the vendors.

Dinis Cruz

Need to be in the room and then have that experience, right, have the
experience of how to bring them on board, how to create the
communication channels. At the moment, if you think about it, every
company needs to set that up. Some companies might have done it better
than others, right? Every company needs to set up the environment, the
relationships, the connections. And again, we don't leverage that. It's
almost like you just need somebody in that group to have that relationship.
Somebody it's almost like in a weird way, again, within a group, we can
even have certain parts of the group saying well, we are really good at this
because for whatever reason in our world, we have to be really good at
this response where maybe another group is really good at DLP, right?
Another group is really good at managing cloud assets. Another group is
really good at this.

Dinis Cruz

Again, think about being able to leverage that and then being able to bring
the vendors in and bring the partners in on peace, but also on incident
wartime, right, where you get the best out of the shared intelligence and
the shared knowledge within those clusters.

Nick Harris

That exact example can work for the vendor because if the vendors, the
DLP vendor, let's take that example, working really well with that
company and they're part of the border community, well, that message is
going to translate. The other parts of the community are going to use the
same vendor. They're going to take the recommendation they've probably
already been part of some demonstrations or actually sitting with the
analysts doing some collaboration and saying, actually just show me how
this tool works. And that's going to drive their business. By putting the
time and effort in to make their product really work. The business will
follow off the back of that.

Dinis Cruz

Absolutely. There's a business incentive for them to do that. Right. The
other element is that we now also start to need the security vendors to be
secure. Right? Which sounds ironic, but come on, let's be clear. Some of
the security vendors, some of them can be the worst ones in security
practices. As the market is evolving and we now need S bombs for
everything, we need really good understanding and really good mappings.
This is also a nice way to ratchet up the quality of the vendors. I already
know stories of some big players who are already putting financial
penalties on companies who don't provide good information about their
security, don't do good due diligence, don't really in a way provide that
good service or that quality product and then really drive independence
down. My comment, I had a panel yesterday, but my comment is like, we
need to make a lot of those things public and there needs to be a lot more
openness industry.

Dinis Cruz

I think what we can be thinking here is we need to start working on that
model. This is like the worldly maps, right? We know that in the next
couple of years the openness will commoditize and it's either going to be
by regulation, by incidents, or by force or by market momentum. There's
going to be a move from where we are with the crew relationship with the
products and the isolation that you have per client to a lot more openness
and cluster driven negotiations. We can already operate at that level and
start thinking about the logistics of making that happen.

Nick Harris

No, you're right. Everyone harps back to Solar Winds being a prime
example of where a close vendor has caused big problems. I think in the
same manner that with shared intelligence, so to speak, but with sharing
happening across the companies about what vendors can work really well,
that you see them invest their time and their effort making things work.
The sharing of the Glitches and the negative side is also going to be more
prolific and get around. If the company that you collaborate with, part of
the CDC over there has a glitch with a vendor, whether it be their own
breach, their own security issue that will come round. Instead of it being
closed, shop and the vendor thinking, well, maybe I'll lag it until it goes
public. Actually, the threat of that knowledge being much more readily
shared, much more public, should drive their own practices in the first
place.

Dinis Cruz

Yeah. And we know that works, right? Because there's already real data
that shows that. Cool. Look, I think this is a first step on this, right? I feel
that let's plan more sessions at the next summits. Let's start bringing
people together. Let's try to make some of these work right, collaborate a
bit more, use this video, right, to generate some more energy. Right? I
think the momentum now is starting to be with, let's create some groups,
let's create some clusters. Let's kind of collaborate, and let's find the
vendors that are working well, the good ones. Right? Because they should
be rewarded. Right? The ones who don't have either good products stop,
innovating, are not providing a great service. They need to steal the
market economics. Right? It's that simple. We want to create an economic
model that rewards investment in good security practice, in good
engineering, good customer services, great relationships, and then they
should get the financial reward and the business out of it.

Dinis Cruz

Right?

Nick Harris

I'm sure if for those that we have that relationship with, we could bring
them along to this thing. Equally, people that watch this, if they got great
vendors that really partner in the way that we talked, bring them along
and generate that kind of that interest and show how well it can work.

Dinis Cruz

Yeah. Cool. There you go. There's the challenge. So, unless in any final
comments, I don't know if Billy want to throw a couple ideas to the table
or Nick final comments. Cool. I think all right, then I see you in the next
one.

Nick Harris

Thank you, everybody. Bye.
