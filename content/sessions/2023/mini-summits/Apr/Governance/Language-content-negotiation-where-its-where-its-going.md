## About this session
Language Content Negotiation (LCN) is a critical aspect of web application security. LCN is a process of selecting the language and content that a web server will respond to a client's request with. It is essential for websites to provide appropriate content in the user's preferred language to enhance their user experience. However, this process can be exploited by attackers, leading to various security vulnerabilities.

 This session will discuss the current state of LCN and its future direction. The speaker will provide a detailed overview of LCN and its evolution over time. The session will also cover the potential security risks and best practices to mitigate them. The speaker will share their experience and insights on how organizations can implement effective LCN strategies to enhance their web application security.
