## About this session
Big enterprises, startups, scaleups, mature in security and just starting their journey - we all from time to time find ourselves in a situation when we wonder what's next? What should we do to make this company secure? Are we doing the right thing? 
Cybersecurity assessments help to get the answers and find a way forward. We will talk about frameworks and approaches, how to start self-assessments and what to look for in third party offers if you need help. 
At the end of the presentation you will know what type of assessment you need now and what first steps to make. 

## Session Transcripts:

Dinis Cruz - 00:03
Welcome to this open security summit session in April 2023. We have Anna
who's going to walk us through cybersecurity assessments finding the Way
Forward. Over to you, Hannah.

Anna Lezhikova - 00:15
Good evening, everyone. Right and like, it's rainy, stormy, cold autumn
morning here in Wellington, New Zealand. 05:00 a.m. That's why for
##give me if any mistakes or slow down or anything like this, but I'm
really happy to be here at the Open Security Summit again. You can hear
from my accent that I'm not native English speaker. I'm originally from
Russia, but I moved to New Zealand over ten years ago now and I work as
cyber security consultant at company called Defense here in New Zealand.
We provide a lot of different services, including just general consulting
that I do. I lead assessment practices in our company means I'm in charge
of defining how good looks like when we do assessments for our clients,
like cybersecurity assessments. That's why I decided I want to share my
experiences, because I do this with multiple clients often, and I just wanted
to share how we approach this and what benefit comes out of it and what
you can do.

Anna Lezhikova - 01:33
Because this is, I find, a very useful thing. Every company at some stage
go through this. So let's have a look. Why are we doing cybersecurity
assessments finding and why? I call it fighting. Way forward. What I see
every day is that cybersecurity is complex, very complex. We cybersecurity
specialists often assume some knowledge and just the state that exists. It
exists only in the area that we can see in our professional area. When we
go outside, it's not as developed as we think. We go outside more and
more because cybersecurity today is not information technology, not
information security area anymore. Today we're talking about
curioperating models. What does it mean? It means that today's security is
part of business function, just every business function. Because decades
ago, even a few years ago, for some companies, digital, like Cyber was
only part of the business. Maybe they were using email or something like
this, then eventually file storage.

Anna Lezhikova - 02:59
Today, I assume you won't be able to find many businesses not having
digital footprint at all. For majority of businesses, being digital is just like
the core business. It means that cybersecurity is part of the core business,
not the It function anymore. When we go out of our It box and embed
security in everything now, it's just that all the relationships, everyone
involved, so many different people with different levels of understanding,
different functions like needs operates securely. This is really hard to grasp
with just an eye, even a small company, it's almost impossible today to just
one person to keep it under their head and come up with roadmap
solutions or any kind of security programs. That's why we need some kind
of structured approach to understand what's going on. I think it's the
same. We could talk about assessments first, but what is an assessment in
general?

Dinis Cruz - 04:09
Google just a quick one on the point you just made, right? I think one of
the things that's interesting that you're touching is the idea that security is
now much more than just even an It function, right? Because we need to
think about security as embedding in the whole company wide operations.
Which also leads us that when we think about fixing and driving change
more and more, like my big paradigm shift was that realizing that we're
not talking about improving a bit of security here. We talk about changing
how sometimes the business operates. It's about driving change because if
you can't change sometimes some business process or some business
activities, business funding, you won't be able to change security. Because
security is almost we sometimes measure the side effects of certain
security or some of business practices.

Anna Lezhikova - 05:05
Exactly. That's why when we talk about security, we don't talk about
technology anymore. We talk about people processes, technology, and the
proportions of this can be different. We in defense, we believe that people
part takes 50% of all security activities when the processes are 30% and
technology only 20%. What I see among clients a lot is that people still do
this. Security equal it. That's why often people who in charge of security
are part of it. Like their security manager will report to CTO or It
manager CTO or something like this, right? So it's still there for me. It's
the same situation as with knowledge walk. We just saw a shift just
recently from conveyor like this production factory floor to a knowledge
Walk to say, oh no, it's different, you can't just use this 40 hours week or
this workshifts or these things. You just really need to find new ways of
organizing work for knowledge work.

Anna Lezhikova - 06:19
That's like the remote work coming in and this like the rejection of the
remote. No, you need to be in the office. No, you don't have to be in the
office for this type of profession. You need flexible hours because you can't
just produce knowledge on a clock, right? Like a pavlov's dog that oh,
now you need to produce that. You produce knowledge from eight to
twelve. You build this in your timesheet, right? So it doesn't work. A lot of
people realize it and it's already wider spread knowledge with security we
see in the same picture, it's against just started spreading knowledge, that
it's not just it function anymore. Because digital is the core type of
functioning for any company today. I highly recommend to Google and to
look into secure operating models. That's the topic that talks about this,
looks into this problem. We've got a very cool expert in this in our
company.

Anna Lezhikova - 07:23
My colleague, I might talk to him just to talk him into presenting this idea
at this forum next time. Yeah, cool idea. Yeah, I'll talk to him. So, moving
forward from this, what our assessments are, because now we agree that
this is everywhere now, and now we need to assess everything. If we go to
assessment just in general, if you Google assessments first, just like
assessment, the first one will be about education, about people, like
students, all the stuff, how we assess people. Seconds will be assessing
systems and first people, then systems. In general, I would say it's the
process is of evaluating or appraising something to determine its quality,
value or performance. We just look at something and say, this works like
this. We also define good or bad. Is it works well enough or not? So, very
simple.

Dinis Cruz - 08:31
If you take this right, isn't there a case to say that there's lots of areas in
the business that also care about this? I work one of my jobs is a big
company in the UK, and then there's parts of the business that have
nothing to do with Cybersecurity, that care about this, that are focused on
managing quality, managing value, managing performance. That could be
throughout the supply chain, that could be on HR operations, et cetera.

Anna Lezhikova - 09:04
What's the name of this? Just with the abbreviation for the index when
they ask, would you recommend this company? Yeah, MPs. So we do MPs
in big companies. We do pay employee MPs, right? Internal one. It's
assessment.

Dinis Cruz - 09:28
Exactly, yeah.

Anna Lezhikova - 09:30
That's why when you will do that's why for example, in defend as a
practice lead, I am working like not only cybersecurity assessments for
consultant led assessments, but also I'm in charge of the general
framework of assessments of all areas in the company, including Microsoft
365 and all engineering stuff and architecture and things as the
framework. What does it mean to assess what are the steps in the
procedure? We will talk about it here, but today we will be talking not
about assessments in general, we will be talking about cybersecurity
resilience assessments, because this is the one that you start with, this is
the one that I would say is the system health check. In our case,
cybersecurity systems, the whole system. Cybersecurity lens or the health
check and the health check, it can be triggered by different things. You've
got something not working or pain somewhere, you go to the doctor and
doctor says, I'm not sure, I think it might be this, but let's do this blood
test and some maybe scans or ultrasound, who knows, right?

Anna Lezhikova - 10:47
Sometimes you feel nice, but you still go for the health check because this
is your regular one and you're aging and you really want to know maybe
something already changing going on. You don't want to be proactive
reactive, you want to be proactive. So that's the same principles. And I
really love this joke. Because it applies to cybersecurity assessments a lot
for me as a consultant, I come across it every time, is that a patient, like a
person comes to the doctor with them, complains that, I got pain
everywhere. The doctor asks, Where do you have pain? I have pain here. I
have been here. I have been here. Doctor looks at his finger, Doctor, am I
dying? Doctor looks at his finger, says, not sure your finger is broken.
Right. I see. It also like, we've got this problem with this cybersecurity
thing. I look at this now, unfortunately, it's not this cybersecurity or
information technology problem, it's a business problem.

Anna Lezhikova - 11:50
That's what you mentioned, and you have to change your business
process.

Dinis Cruz - 11:57
Couldn't you rename this to say cybersecurity assessments finding a
business system health check?

Anna Lezhikova - 12:05
Yeah. As a business system health check, yeah, good point.

Dinis Cruz - 12:08
Because there's a direct correlation, isn't it? There's a direct correlation
between the things that we raise in cybersecurity, which to be side effects,
and business health check, which are operations that are not working
effectively.

Anna Lezhikova - 12:22
It's when we talk about cybersecurity assessments finding. If you do any
assessment, it will be any system health check. Right. For example, you do
your Microsoft three six five assessment. You are checking your health of
your Microsoft Three Six five ecosystem. Right, just in general.

Dinis Cruz - 12:44
Cybersecurity, I think, has a very interesting property, which is, if we can
connect the dots, we can connect a problem with its side effects and its
risk. In a way, if you think about it, like if you apply risk analysis to the
outcomes of your assessment, and if you then connect your risks to your
threat agents and your assets and your values and the probability and
your incidents, the health check becomes a lot more significant. Because
it's not just this is bad or this is normal.

Anna Lezhikova - 13:18
We'll get there. We'll get there. That's the thing that I see a lot in the
industry, and that's what we offered differently. And we'll talk about it. So
yeah. About this business patience. Yeah. Another thing to be careful is
that sometimes people misplace, like, confuse audits and assessments and
just be careful when someone says, oh, we need to do assessment, and
sometimes they mean audit and vice versa. When some people say, oh, let's
do the audit, but actually they're doing assessments, but there is
difference, and there is difference in that. That for standards. So for the
audit, it's documented criteria. Sorry, I've got a typo in here. Anyway, so
fix it. It's documented criteria and it's very strong, like, very strict. Like,
you've got your like, for example, 27 ISO, twenty seven K one. It's a
certificate, like certification. They've got very strong strict requirements
and you have to check everything.

Anna Lezhikova - 14:32
Do you meet or not? With this assessments, it's general guidance. You can
follow these standards, but you don't have to another quality of our
assessments is that systematic. Assessments, you can use any framework,
it's very flexible. You can change it to meet your current business
requirements or accompanying or any of the situational requirements.
With the audits, it's documented procedures. That's why you have to be
certified to be an auditor. You have to learn there are rules and that's
quite strict. Most important one, I think the biggest difference between
audits assessments is the trust. With audits, you can't check the box if you
don't have the evidence and you really dig deep and show me this and this.
With assessments, we don't do this because for assessments, speed is more
important than the digging deep and we just ask questions and people will
say something like the answer say, yeah, we do this or we do that, and it's
good enough for assessments.

Anna Lezhikova - 15:43
We don't observe, we don't go to logs or anything like this to prove that
they're doing this. This is very important to understand because when you
do your internal assessment, don't dig deep, just really look at what's
happening, talk to people, and it's good enough for this type of evaluation.
Any questions here?

Dinis Cruz - 16:06
No, I think it's great. I think you can add there's definitely some memes
that you can add to this, right?

Anna Lezhikova - 16:12
Yeah. But just be careful.

Dinis Cruz - 16:17
Because I think that there is that thing where I won't say it's on the two
worlds of do you want to be compliant or do you want to be secure? Right.
Actually, if you want to be compliant, you can do an audit. Right. If you
actually want to be secure or safe, you actually do assessments and you
need to have the feedback loop and then you have those maturity models
of understanding where also but also the assessment allows you to add a
context because you want to then start to put things within. Again, I think
security, we do a lot of this service by focusing sometimes too much on
audit type things on the assessment exact checklist right. Which can
actually cause a lot more damage than other things, where if you can have
an assessment and you have context, then you can adjust much more the
risk appetites of what you're operating on.

Anna Lezhikova - 17:13
Audits work perfectly with tech side of security and also well with
processes. Audits don't work well with people and that's why you need
assessments. It means that when you do the audits, you miss 50% of your
security activities. Right.

Dinis Cruz - 17:31
I would even argue even on the first one, they don't work very well. Right.

Anna Lezhikova - 17:34
Anything that still better, but on people, they just don't work at all. You
can't checklist. That's why but you need all of this because you need
audits, like you said, for compliance and for other regulatory obligations.
Right. But just people misuse these words often.

Dinis Cruz - 17:56
Like they just the key. There is evidence. Right. I think the other key word
that you have there is evidence right. On this. Actually, Billy just made a
really good point. Billy, I'll just make you a co host. You can chip in, right,
if you want to. Right? You want to just make your point. You just send on
the chats if you're able to.

Speaker 3 - 18:22
Can you hear me?

Dinis Cruz - 18:23
Yeah, we can.

Anna Lezhikova - 18:24
Perfect. Hello.

Speaker 3 - 18:25
Hi. Pretty much every business I've worked in, I'm not really a
cybersecurity professional or anything. I'm learning right now, but not
necessarily dealing with security. Anytime there is any kind of an audit or
something like that.

Dinis Cruz - 18:51
Everybody.

Speaker 3 - 18:52
Is told about it. We're all on alert, ready for this. Usually on a specific day
and a specific shift that the auditor is going to be showing up and
everybody is behaving themselves and is being perfect just to pass that
audit, completely defeating the entire purpose of it.

Dinis Cruz - 19:21
You're compliant on July 22, right. And then October 714, which is the.

Speaker 3 - 19:27
Dates of you need those surprise audits where they just show up.

Dinis Cruz - 19:34
Or you need but then this is the thing again, it uses the definition if you go
to an evidence space, you can ask for evidence that has happened
throughout a period of time. Once you go versus a trust based so yeah,
we're doing it to evidence, then you cannot just act in one day. Right. You
actually have to show that you've been acting like that throughout the last
six years.

Anna Lezhikova - 20:02
Absolutely. Yeah. When you trust base because you talk to people and
gather this information, analyze it, and you are human and you talk to
people not by you not ask the questions, but pull these things like
conversations. I can tell you as an assessor that it's very difficult to hide
things. You can fill it, you can see it, how people talk about their controls
and procedures. Okay, let's move on. We've got a few more slides to cover.
Okay, so another thing that we're not talking about assessments, they're
not rules, but something that we have to keep in mind. The assessment
should be fair and fair, I mean, that you should not paint the picture better
than it is internally or externally. You should really be honest about what's
happening and it should be valid. You can't just come up with things or
pretend that you see something or don't see something.

Anna Lezhikova - 21:07
They really need to be, like we say, no evidence, but it should not be
fantasized too much. Some people think about it, but you need a bit to
have use. That's why I use cross examination kind of techniques and to
make sure that whatever information comes is true. They need to be
reliable means. That what I mean by reliable here, that though it's not
freestyle, there's still structure and procedure to assessment. It means that
you can repeat it and then you can compare results. When you see the
numbers there and some charts and findings, that you can build your
program or do some actions based on this. Useful, this is important one
because often I see reports that have a lot of information, they're huge
and they're very informative and interesting from the, again, expert point
of view. When you give it to business and they read it and they just look at
you and we don't know what to do next.

Anna Lezhikova - 22:22
Sometimes I come across these clients that had this assessment, some kind
of assessment some long time ago, and say, yeah, we've got this document
but we didn't do anything because we didn't know how to act on it.

Dinis Cruz - 22:38
Yeah, I think there's some interesting sorry, there's some properties that
come out of it like unreliable repeatable. It's interesting because again,
you're almost making it focus on the quality outcomes we want to get to
be useful means it should be actionable, something should come out of it,
right? You want to make sure that people understand it and you can
repeat it like reliable. If you make the same assessment every month or
every week or every six months, you should produce similar results, right?
Or else you don't get that, right? That's why I like the definition of
assessments because it forces us to also measure these properties, which is
what we want to be.

Anna Lezhikova - 23:23
Indeed. Of how this assessment fit into the cyber. Like, we're talking about
cyber resilience now. We will talk about just in general assessments. We
will talk about cyber resilience or sometimes it's called maturity. We prefer
to call it cyber resilience. And I'll just explain why. This is the kind of
paradigm I came up with, I utilize for my work today. That's when we talk
about good security posture or mature security, that's some kind of
baseline that we want to get to. The company starts their security journey,
so they want to get to some state, this is a good state of security and they
create the security program to get there. I see a lot of companies at this
stage because a lot of companies just start in their security journey. They
use assessments, they do assessments at the beginning. This is where we
are. That's how assessments really help to shape the security program,
showing the gaps.

Anna Lezhikova - 24:31
Because to be honest, I see companies that just like really zero. No, they
still have some. Microsoft is doing good job there because as soon as the
company sign ups for Microsoft, they fed all these bits and pieces like they
sold to them. Some of these bits and pieces are about security. Just it's
embedded in there like Asia Ad or just going to the cloud in general or
some other defender. It's there and it means that they've got some
controls. What they're missing, like majority of cases is the program, some
good plan, some understanding like thinking around, okay, this is where
we are from cybersecurity resilience point of view where we need to move
to. We do assessments for them and assessment report is a huge help to
define this program to the good posture for mature companies at any level
of maturity. The problem is then as soon as you get to this point, it's good
enough.

Anna Lezhikova - 25:49
There are some companies, I've seen some companies are amazing and
this luckily we have them and I wish we had more. People and companies
are growing in this area so they achieve this good state. But the
environment is constantly changing. The thing about resilience is that for
me, I define resilience as being able to adapt to withstand the change and
stay secure when the environment constantly changes. You constantly
redefining your good and you check how you're doing to the redefined
good. That's what the people not mistake kind of thing they're doing
today. They define this is the good place, we assessed against it and then in
a year we assess again and a year assess again. The thing is that the good
definition changes. You need to change this defined good and then check
against this new good. So there's two parallel processes happening. It's
like juggling things, but for the mature companies it's not about just
security program, but how to change your goals, how to make sure that
you check against your risks all the time, how do you embed the change in
threat environment and the staff.

Anna Lezhikova - 27:34
So how to keep this security posture. Again you use assessment to check
how you are doing.

Dinis Cruz - 27:44
On that, do you also measure the cases where security happened because
you embedded pieces and where security happened because you had to put
energy on it? For a good example, let's say that you arrive at the first time
of the company, a lot of the security activities are going to happen because
you put energy into it, right? Almost you have to use a security program to
move the needle. If you go back to your initial point, which is a lot of times
what we're doing is we're changing business processes and we change
how the business operates. There's going to be times where you actually
change how the business operates so that the next iteration of the business
is already at a good level of security. You almost don't have to put energy
to basically to keep or maintain that state. And I think that's a very
interesting.

Anna Lezhikova - 28:35
Way to you still have.

Dinis Cruz - 28:41
To, but it's almost like it's the place where you actually got security
because you change how the business operates versus the more whacka
mole where you have to go, okay, let's keep improving the security which
basically via security program, right?

Anna Lezhikova - 28:59
Yeah, you change the business and business changes. Even if this stuff is
still like just imagine that you change the business and you've got much
better security posture now. You would think, we've got less things to do
now, but the threat environment changes.

Dinis Cruz - 29:24
Yeah, I don't think we have less to do because yes, you're right. Also you
increase the things you want to change. Right. But your scope increases. I
think it's interesting to measure how much of real impact you're doing,
how much you're moving from Whack A Mole to actually doing a lot more
strategic things and already working on much more the medium and long
term where the business is going. Because the business is also changing
dramatically.

Anna Lezhikova - 29:51
Yeah. So you can measure whatever. What I love about this simple, this
paradigm, it helps to just look at this from different angles and talk to
everyone in the business. Because you add details in here with the like, if
you apply to a company and admit to it for the company, there will be
business risks, business processes, and it allows you to talk to business
about it. And I agree with you. Like, security program here, it's not
classical security program. Security program is that they were talking
about the secure operating model based on the Q operating model. It's not
just like, okay, let's create policies now. Let's do the configure our controls
and stuff. Now, security program here would be we have a security
steering committee that talks and reports to the board regularly. In this
committee, we've got representatives from all business functions. We
decide what we need to do with people, processes and technology.

Anna Lezhikova - 31:01
That's why the security program should be not part of the It department.
This is the top business level thing that driven by security Steering
Committee.

Dinis Cruz - 31:16
How do you capture the data that you show there? You have tools that you
use spreadsheets.

Anna Lezhikova - 31:20
How do you capture data to you're talking about assessments.

Dinis Cruz - 31:23
Well, the output of the assessments and then the translation from the
assessments to.

Anna Lezhikova - 31:27
The we've got 20 minutes to cover the slides. Okay, so when we're talking
about cybersecurity assessments, we do not invent Bicycle, we use
frameworks. Actually, you can use any framework, including ISO Twenty
seven k One, because they've got a set of controls. You can use any set of
controls as your question points. But again, we're not doing audit. You see
this is 27 one k, it's not about audit, but it's using this structure, their
approach, how they slice this elephant. Right. I call it a butcher map. You
can use any butcher map in here. The most user, like the two ones that I
use almost every day are NIST CSF and CAS Cybersecurity 18.
Cybersecurity controls for New Zealand is also very important. One is NZ.
Ism that all government agencies use. I think for Europe, it will be
something like GDPR guidelines or some other stuff.

Anna Lezhikova - 32:34
ISO Twenty Seven k One is also a good framework because it's not the
controls one twenty seven k two, but this one is called Risk Management
Certification. It really helps to understand your controls, how they related
to risks. We will talk more in detail. I will use as examples NIST and CIS
and we'll look right now how assessment would look like and what we
would use there. Assessment procedure that I use and that I looked at
other solutions like tools and stuff and then that would be for most of
them it's the same. We get the context and just to really understand what
we're doing here, what the organization is about, especially for the
external assessment, it's very important to understand what this business
is about. That's where I have a meeting with the customer and I just ask so
what's your business? Tell me about this, so what do you do, what's your
crown jewels?

Anna Lezhikova - 33:39
What's the most important to you, what's your place in the industry? And
all these type of questions. Then we create threat taxonomy. We either ask
them, but not all companies have it and it's not even the risk register
because often it's not usable for assessments. We just create this risk
taxonomy to understand what the major risks for this company, depending
on their industry or nature of their business. We gather data by conducting
interviews, sometimes reading documents, but interviews is the main
source of the data. Then I do analysis. All these interview answers I will
record into a tool or spreadsheet and we'll talk about it in more detail in a
second. And then I score the findings. Again we'll talk about it, what does
it mean and what possible in there and then I will compile a report with all
these charts and findings and recommendations and then I will present it.

Anna Lezhikova - 34:39
Again the presentation will the type of presentation will depend on who we
are talking to. It just business or the business and experts, or just experts?
It depends. Sometimes I do more than one presentation depending on for
different audiences in the company. Let's have a look into each step in
detail where we'll talk about tools and what's possible. So, context
gathering, it's important to identify stakeholders. It's not only for external,
for internal assessments also it's important to understand who will
consume your report and whom to talk to, who will be in charge, like who
will help you to get access to people you need to get access to. You need to
identify main respondents, just like not everyone. You do not need to
interview everyone in the company depending on the context. You really
just, okay, I need to talk to CFO, COO and CTO for example, and plus to
whoever is doing the security Manager because there will be technical
questions about infrastructure network and devices and all this stuff.

Anna Lezhikova - 35:52
Then we. Describe business context, just what this business is about and
what's important for it, and create threat taxonomy. So, threat taxonomy,
there's a lot of guides, you can just Google it and there will be a lot of just
like lists, like trees of all possible threats. I have my guide, I just use it for
my conversations. I get this from conversations with people. Just what's
important for you? What the worst thing can happen? What will happen to
a business?

Dinis Cruz - 36:25
I really like that. How do you store that tree?

Anna Lezhikova - 36:32
Yeah, so it's just a document and for me, just like there will be high level
taxonomy sorry, some of the stuff I can't share because it's intellectual
property of the company and stuff.

Dinis Cruz - 36:43
Yeah, of course.

Anna Lezhikova - 36:49
Threat taxonomy for me just a tree. The high level will look like data loss,
system compromise outages like unavailability that threats, right? There
will be something like this. Then inside you'll have different types. Data
loss, you'll have intentional data loss, unintentional data, like
unintentional data exposure, intentional loss like breach from the system
compromise. It will be credentials compromise or network perimeter
breach or something like this. If you Google, you can find it online. There's
different things because if you are doing assessments internally, it's a nice
thing to have. A mature company will have it done because usually it's one
of the things we also offer. Where I do thread taxonomy, like thread
workshops, right, so you do like in the business, you'll have it, but if the
business is not mature enough, especially if it's a small company, we do
assessments for company with the ten people size, why not?

Anna Lezhikova - 37:59
They also need for the organizations.

Dinis Cruz - 38:02
Do you have thread trees that are customized to specifically business
sectors or particular teams? You isolate a little bit that taxonomy?

Anna Lezhikova - 38:10
No, for myself, I just found out that the difference between business so it's
more about stage of the business than the industry. There is huge
difference. For example, differences like health, for example banking, like
finance, health finance and then everyone else, because we don't go deep
into physical security here, there's of this from my experience, physical
security is in most of the cases well covered because it's health and safety.
There's a lot of regulations.

Dinis Cruz - 38:49
No, I was thinking more in terms of the different maturity levels of
different parts of the organization that will have different threads, but
also the assets that they have. If you look at a part of the organization
that deals with healthcare data, it's very different from an organization
that deals with public information or a part of organization that deals
with let's say CVS or HR data, right? Each of those actually has different
threads and different threat actors, right?

Anna Lezhikova - 39:15
I found out that all organizations there will be something like for all of
them, there will be shared common threads like all the same. Everyone is
susceptible for data loss and system compromise. Right. What's important
is the details. I do the report, I put there like in what form exactly for this
business, the threat can be materialized. Right. I was thinking about, okay,
we can have different taxonomies for different industries at the blueprint
to use. Then, I don't know, it's just at the blueprint level, it's the same for
everyone. At the detail level, it's different for everyone.

Dinis Cruz - 40:04
Of course. Yeah, cool. Absolutely.

Anna Lezhikova - 40:07
Yeah. So data gathering, what do we do? So interviews and documents.
Yes, and interviews I really enjoyed because it's kind of of interrogation
and cross examination, but in a friendly manner. Because what you try to
find out truth, you try to find out who's the murder right. Murderer kind of
thing. Sometimes I feel like they are acute poor or trying to what do you
really mean? What are you really doing here? Because sometimes people
really do not understand how these things connected to security and why
are asking this? I explained that, this, how it can be exploited. That's why
it's important that you are doing this or this and this area things. A lot of
education happened in Drew and interviewing because people didn't think
about a lot of things before they were asked. I really love assessments as a
part of eye opening for people.

Anna Lezhikova - 41:05
When you start asking the question what about this, what about that? Oh,
we didn't think about this, we didn't know it's connected to our
cybersecurity and all this stuff. Now, you know, thank you so much. They
start thinking in this direction. So I really enjoy this documents. Just what
I usually do is just to really look at the information security policy few
standards, their existence is already a good sign. I don't go deep into the
detailing, that's the audit job. It's nice to look at these documents to see
the security culture. You can see information security policy, the main one,
it just tells about the maturity of the company straight away tools. This is
an important one for most of the cases. There are some tools on the
market. Unfortunately I have to come across a good one yet. For self
assessment, for internal assessments, when you do it not as a consultant,
as a business to a company, like to many customers, but if you just do it
for your company, there are some stuff, they're all the same.

Anna Lezhikova - 42:20
What's important is not the quality of the tool, but the understanding how
to apply it. We'll talk about in the next slide. If at the beginning you even
don't have to have a tool, you can use a spreadsheet. What you do, you
take NIST for example, and NIST got all these categories and functions,
categories and subcategories. Each subcategory you turn into a question
about the subcategory and then you have a column for information about
answers. There will be scoring column for score, we'll talk about it and
then you take all the scores into the next tab and then you create charts.
I'm sure if you look up online there will be something that people might be
shared because we use our internal one. My personally developed
spreadsheet for CS assessments. I just conduct interview, I will just put all
the answers into the boxes, then I will score it and then all the score goes
into this charts.

Anna Lezhikova - 43:27
I have this charts by function, by device, by type of the control. They're
called save cards and sales and then Nissan the same. You also put
recommendations in another column that will help you to see. We'll talk
about it in the analysis, how I look at the recommendations and then
compile a report. With tooling I can show you one tool for CIS 18. It's a
nice tool that you can use for self assessment. But can you see this? Can
you see my browser?

Dinis Cruz - 44:08
Yeah.

Anna Lezhikova - 44:11
The links to all this stuff will be at the final slide. There will be links to all
these resources so people can just look at it, take a screenshot or
whatever. This is like CSS control system specification. It's an open source
document that is shared on GitHub. You even can edit it by creating a pull
request. What I love about it is that if you go to a control, it's got all the
different explanation of this control even more than in the official
documentation. You've got safeguards for this control and for safeguards
you've got inputs and what do you need to so this one be careful with this
one. I don't use it literally like it is, because it sounds like audit. Like you
really gather evidence and you count things like how many unauthorized
devices compared to authorized devices you have in the system and this
type of stuff.

Anna Lezhikova - 45:16
Reading through this will really give you a good picture of what we're
talking about in here. If you need to go to more measured stuff later, this
also got all these formulas and metrics how to measure the stuff. So this
one is also good. You can use this metrics as part of your security
program, but don't take it literally. If you go to self assessment, you don't
have to collect all these metrics and calculate them. You can if you have
time and it's required by your organizational style. If there is need for this
and budget for this time budget, you can, but you don't have to just take it
with not pinch of salt. Just like you don't have to do all the steps literally
how they recommend it here, but it's a very good example how you can
turn assessment into metrics later for your cybersecurity program.

Anna Lezhikova - 46:20
Yeah, in general you can just start with the spreadsheet and it works.
Analysis. So this is very important one. That's where the threat taxonomy
plays the key role and how it says, like why I'm saying that unfortunately,
Chat GPT so far cannot help in here. That's another point that I will talk
about it later . That you can have self assessment or you can invite
outsource it invite like a consultant. That's where the consultant really
pays off in analysis, because this is a tricky thing. You record findings for
each control or safeguard or subcategory. It depends on the framework
you use. You score them. And scoring can be different. Depends. For the
NIST one, it's very popular. One is like zero. The control is not existent,
nonexistent one will be exists, but not none efficient. Two is partially
efficient and three is fully efficient. But what does it mean?

Anna Lezhikova - 47:41
That's important part. We look at the control and we do not check it. Yes,
it exists, it works. We look at the control and if this control reduces the
risk that related to the thread that we defined, then we mark it as
efficient. Sometimes if the control is just not fully implemented, but how it
was implemented is this reduces the risk for this company a lot because
the risk is low, then we can market efficient because it's enough.
Sometimes the control is implemented in full. Some like technical control,
but in our case, for this question, for this subcategory, for example, the
threat introduced threat, like we found out, defined in the South Threat
Taxonomy, the risk that introduced by the threat is not reduced at all
because this technical control exists. Another control process, control for
example, is missing. Even if it's a checkbox, yes, we've got inventory, but if
this inventory is not connected to detecting unauthorized devices, who
cares, right?

Anna Lezhikova - 49:02
Something like this. That's why it's very important to understand these
links between each safeguard and risks and threats and then you evaluate
them only in the light of these risks and threats. Not just like yes, we have
it, and now swearing to have it. That's the pitfall a lot of self assessment
and often outsourced assessments fall into. Again, that we mentioned
before, it's not a checklist here. You really need to involve this
understanding of the business context, business functions and relations
between all the things inside of the business and outside of the business.
That's where your expertise, knowledge and general knowledge comes
into play. That's where you can think about the safeguard and say yes, it's
efficient. No, it's not efficient. The same thinking is used in the
recommendations. Okay, you don't have this what you need to have to
reduce this risk in this control area and it's not possible just by checking.

Anna Lezhikova - 50:11
So whatever ask, we need this control. Okay. We need to have MFA for
everything. MFA for everything? Yes. We recommend I'll just use it as an
example. Just imagine that for your company it will be very difficult to
implement it for everyone for different like for cultural reasons. For
example, people are very conservative and they would reject for example,
most of your workforce would reject it. Right? They don't use mobile
phones much, something like this. For you, the risk would be very low
because most of them don't have access to much of the system. You don't
recommend them to roll out MFA for everyone. You would recommend to
roll out MMFA only for admin accounts, for example. That's when we do
recommendations based on the business context because the main goal is
to achieve the balance between doing the business and being secure
because security in most cases is slowing down the business.

Anna Lezhikova - 51:18
This is your brakes. You need your brakes, but you don't use them all the
time. You still need the car. Keep moving. Right? So that's the balance. To
reach this balance, you really need to understand business context and the
relationship between risk threats and security controls. And reports. We
just do every report should have executive summary, some background and
findings and recommendations and extra use information. So the charts
would look like this. You can see this example of just like the charts from
the spreadsheets I created. It's very important to show the report language
style meets your audience requirements. This is very important to have an
executive summary in every report because some people who are busy and
they don't care about the details like on the sea level or the board, they
still can understand what's going on by just reading one page of it and
presentation again, depends on the audience.

Anna Lezhikova - 52:27
And stick to the most important points. Don't be boring. Honestly. Just
security is not all complex, difficult and boring. Talk about business, don't
talk about firewalls and access like AJD details like security groups and
stuff. Yeah, read the room.

Dinis Cruz - 52:46
Well, that's the key, right? Make sure it's relevant to your audience. Make
sure you have business context. Right. Because then they really take it in
and I really like that risk based approach right, to present to them.

Anna Lezhikova - 52:57
Yeah, because assessments are always about business, not about tech. This
is, I think, the main message I would love to deliver today. They are way
forward for the whole company. They're way forward for the business, not
for the It department or security team. As I mentioned already, so we have
internal, external, we have initial, we have reassessment and reassessment.
Just like when you repeat it. It's very nice to see the progress. You can
have extra charts like in time. Okay, were here, now we're here. And this is
what business really likes. This is like reassessments are really important
for justifying your budget. This is what your main tool to get the budget
for the next year, for your security function. That's why it's good to start
them at some point. Now you can show how it's improving so we can and
that you need more.

Anna Lezhikova - 53:52
That's important to have this balance between, okay, we're improving, but
this is how much left, how many gaps is still there? So please give us
money. Right. This is resources I was talking about. So this is the NISS
framework. This is just description. You can download their PDF with all
the safeguards so to create. I'm sure there is a spreadsheet somewhere
online I saw some time ago. Yes, they're definitely there a lot of stuff
available. Again, it doesn't matter what tool you're using. Most
importantly is that you link whatever controls you're facing, whatever
questions you've got, you link it to business function, risk and threat,
because it's not important if you have it or not. If it's not reduces the
actual risk for the business.

Dinis Cruz - 54:49
Very cool, to be honest. What would be amazing is see if you can
anonymize some of your actual reports and some of your visualizations
and some of your examples, because that bringing a lot more to light,
right?

Anna Lezhikova - 55:10
Yeah. Unfortunately, IP, this is like what brings this company, how I bring
this company money. It's just like because the tools are not available
widely and open tools. That's why we invent our own tools.

Dinis Cruz - 55:28
Well, there's still a place in the market, right? It's still a place in the
market for this because you're right, there isn't a lot of good tools, which
actually we talk about this on a chat GPT session. Right. I think there's a
lot of evolution that we're going to see on these areas that really need
context and analysis. I think the next evolution of GPT like technologies,
where you can really isolate the data set, so you can say, look, here's a big
data set, go and consume it. Now you can query it. That's going to be
crazy powerful.

Anna Lezhikova - 56:01
Yeah. With assessments, I would be careful to go into the big data because
I think from my experience, when I started this, I got AI and data
background, technical background. So, okay, what can I do? How I can
make it efficient, how I can just really the processes, how I automate stuff,
how I make it, like, really, what can I do here from the tool perspective?
When half a year into this, I just learned that the most important part in
here is talking to people and applying this general analysis. You can't
replace it by no tool or no information.

Dinis Cruz - 56:44
Absolutely. But you can scale that analysis, right?

Anna Lezhikova - 56:49
I don't know. I'm not sure. I don't know. Maybe because currently I'm
training my colleagues to do this, cybersecurity consultants, like they
started in this journey and to train them. And when I explain them to them.
What I do every time I understand how would automate because for
automation, I really love this stuff. I'm a former software engineer that I
really love coding and how would I code it. I understand that every time
the most important insights come from conversations.

Dinis Cruz - 57:31
Yeah.

Anna Lezhikova - 57:36
Putting aside this, I confident there are a lot of things to use AI like open
AI type of models in gathering data and organizing data for future
analysis. I agree. Just in general, cybersecurity, I see a lot of yeah. Favorite
location. Yeah.

Dinis Cruz - 57:59
Cool. Well, I think that was that's all the questions we had here. Thanks
for doing the session. This was really cool. The video will be available very
soon and I'll see you on the next one.

Anna Lezhikova - 58:10
Thank you so much. Bye. Really?
