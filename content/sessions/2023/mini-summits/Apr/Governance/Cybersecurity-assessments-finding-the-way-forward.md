## About this session
"Big enterprises, startups, scaleups, mature in security and just starting their journey - we all from time to time find ourselves in a situation when we wonder what's next? What should we do to make this company secure? Are we doing the right thing? 
Cybersecurity assessments help to get the answers and find a way forward. We will talk about frameworks and approaches, how to start self-assessments and what to look for in third party offers if you need help. 
At the end of the presentation you will know what type of assessment you need now and what first steps to make. "
