## About this session
Katas are great ways to practice the movements of martial arts. They allow the practitioners to gain muscle knowledge to get more fluid movements. The same principle has been proposed by Neal Ford and others for System architecture. 
In this session we will 
a) Take a kata excercise from https://nealford.com/katas/list.html
b) Create an architecture to satisfy the requirements
c) Threat model this architecture and rate findings.
This will be a working session open to newbies and experienced practitioners, where we will work together  in creating the architecture and the threat model.
