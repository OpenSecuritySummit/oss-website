## About this session
In an era where cyber threats evolve at an unprecedented pace, traditional methods of incident response testing often fall short. This presentation introduces "AttackGen", a groundbreaking tool that seamlessly integrates the MITRE ATT&CK framework with state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). Attendees will be taken on a journey from a live demonstration of AttackGen's capabilities to a deeper exploration of its mechanics. The talk will culminate with a broader discussion on the transformative potential of LLMs in cybersecurity, exploring how they can be harnessed for tasks ranging from threat intelligence to code scanning.
