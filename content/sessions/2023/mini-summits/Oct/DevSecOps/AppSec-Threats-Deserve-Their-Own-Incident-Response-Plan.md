## About this session

Despite the popularity of AppSec related incidents, most organizations do not have an incident response plan in place. Those that do have an IR playbook, often prepare to respond to infra-related attacks such as ransomware, rather than app. Attacks. Given the prevalence of these attacks, this presentation will provide a quick response playbook and review the characteristics that make AppSec IR deserving of its own plan.
