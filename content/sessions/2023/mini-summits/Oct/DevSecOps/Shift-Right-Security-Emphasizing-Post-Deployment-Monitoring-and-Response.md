## About this session
This topic focuses on the concept of "shift-right" security, which emphasizes monitoring and response practices after the software is deployed. It examines techniques for detecting and responding to security incidents in production environments, including log analysis, anomaly detection, and incident response automation.
### Outline:
- Introduction to shift-right security and its significance in DevSecOps
- Monitoring and analyzing production logs for security insights
- Techniques for anomaly detection and behavior-based security monitoring
- Incident response automation and remediation strategies
- Collaboration between development, operations, and security teams for effective incident response
