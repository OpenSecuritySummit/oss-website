## About this session
This topic focuses on the implementation of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) in cloud environments. It examines the principles and best practices of ZTA, including micro-segmentation, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and continuous monitoring, to enhance security in a cloud-centric ecosystem.

### Outline:
- Introduction to Zero Trust Architecture and its Significance in cloud security
- Micro-segmentation and network-based access controls
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and continuous identity verification
- Leveraging automation for policy enforcement and anomaly detection
- Case studies highlighting successful implementations of Zero Trust Architecture in the cloud
