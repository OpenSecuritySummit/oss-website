## About this session
In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, the relationship between developers and application security is paramount. Yet, too often, these two entities operate in silos, leading to overlooked vulnerabilities and missed opportunities for innovation.

In this session, we'll explore:

- The Empathy Connection: Drawing parallels from UX/UI, we'll delve into understanding the mindset of developers, demonstrating how application security teams can harness humanistic behaviorism to foster enhanced collaboration.

- Proactive vs Reactive Security: Utilizing the principles of foresight, we'll dissect how developers and application security teams can anticipate threats before they manifest. By transitioning from a mindset of 'fixing what's broken' to 'anticipating and preparing,' we can usher in a new era of cybersecurity resilience.

- Behavioral Economics in Decision Making: A deep dive into how economic decision-making processes can influence secure coding practices. By understanding the inherent biases and motivators for developers, security teams can craft strategies that align with developer objectives, promoting more secure applications.

- Enhancing Developer-Application Security Synergy: Drawing from Human-Computer Interaction principles, we'll investigate the potential touchpoints where developer tools and security protocols intersect, offering streamlined and intuitive processes that bolster security without impeding development.

- In our journey to secure the digital frontier, bridging the gap between developers and application security is not just recommended—it's essential. Through a unique blend of foresight, human-centric design, and behavioral understanding, we can reimagine this relationship, driving innovation and fortifying our digital assets.
