## About this session
Discussing the unique security considerations and risks associated with serverless architectures and exploring how threat modeling can help identify and mitigate potential threats.

### Outline:
- Overview of serverless computing and its security implications
- Analysis of common security risks and vulnerabilities in serverless architectures 
- Techniques for conducting effective threat modeling in serverless environments
- Real-world examples and case studies of threat modeling in serverless deployments
