## Transcript:
Dinis Cruz - 00:00
Yeah. Hi. Welcome to this open security summit session in October 2023.
And I'm here with Chen, and we're going to be talking about, I think, a
massive topic in our industry, which is basically how you address
cybersecurity talent gap and fundamentally the growing skill shortages
that we I think we all feel. Anybody who's hiring and is building teams
experience this. So you want to just kick us off, Chen, and give
introduction about you and then your views on this topic?

Chen Gour-Arie - 00:33
Yeah. So. Hello, everybody. I'm Chen. Coming from many years in hands
on application security, I've been consultant through, say, the first half of
my career. A lot of pen testing, been around many places and so I kind of
struggle with the problem. I must say that by the time I was a consultant,
not many companies were directly employing cybersecurity professionals.
It just started, it was mostly consultants at the beginning and then slowly
but surely, companies realized that they need to build their own internal
task force. And it was fascinating to see how the industry responded to the
cybersecurity threat by building internal capabilities and internal teams
and developing methodologies. The second half of my career I was still in
cybersecurity, but more on the Venzo side. So building products, including
my startup, was recently acquired by Sneak and Enzo Security.

Chen Gour-Arie - 01:43
This was the first ASPM solution on the planet and just a few months back
we got acquired by Sneak. And there I was, responsible for many different
things, but essentially building up a platform that will help companies
manage and run their application security gig, which I think is one of the
areas where the expertise needed are so delicate and the frameworks and
methodologies and structure around the problem space are so
proliferated, where this actually become a very big issue. So, yeah, I think
maybe this group is small enough that we can open up everybody's access
to microphone and then we can have it as a discussion because otherwise
it would be just the two of us.

Dinis Cruz - 02:41
Yeah, absolutely. I'm making everybody a co host. Right. So if you guys
feel free to chip in with your views and talk about this.

Chen Gour-Arie - 02:52
Right.

Dinis Cruz - 02:52
I think this is a really key thing. One topic maybe first to explore, maybe a
little bit not controversial, but I would say I don't think we have in a total
a skill shortage. I think we have a skills transfer problem. I think what
we're not very good at is creating opportunities and creating recruitment
workflows that allows individuals and talent from other industries outside
cybersecurity, from either technology or engineering or even left fields,
from medicine, from poetry, from all sorts of different ways of life, right.
And professionals to bring them into the cybersecurity field, because I
actually feel that will increase the diversity of what we have, but I think it
will bring a lot of experienced professionals in our field that also really
needs them. So it's not necessarily that our pool is quite small.

Dinis Cruz - 03:51
It's like maybe we should have a bigger pool of talent to draw from.

Chen Gour-Arie - 03:57
For me, when I think about this subject, I think that there are a few things
to recognize. First is that the entire information technology industry is
quite new. When you compare it to other industries, then even when you
think about other industries that are similar in nature to what we are
doing, which is actually building things and you look at other industries
that are about creating products and building products, you'd see that
there is always different levels of professionality. You'd look at one shop
and they'll be building in a very chaotic way. And then you look at another
shop and they will be building very accurately with planning and designs.
So the industry by itself is young. Building software, building applications,
building digital systems is very difficult. There isn't yet a perfect way to do
this.

Chen Gour-Arie - 04:59
Everybody struggles with leading an effective operation of building
software. It includes a lot of talent, a lot of different aspects that you need
to consider when you're working on this. And then in this industry, this
kind of bad boy, which is cybersecurity, is even younger than the industry
itself. And he's trying to deliver something that requires first
understanding all lot of information about building information
technologies and then understanding where it can go wrong and also
providing a practical solution for securing it. It's a lot to know, it's a lot of
knowledge, it's a lot to take in and it's a lot to deliver to. And in this, we
still haven't figured out what would be the right way, what is the right
methodology, what are the actual things that we need to worry about.

Chen Gour-Arie - 06:02
So, for example, one of the things we've been focusing when we build
Enzo security was the specific topic of how do we build up a very
professional approach to the problem space? How do we try to eliminate
the cry wolf situation where many cybersecurity professionals think that
it's their job to just raise the alarm, but it isn't really? It's also to build up
into the culture of the organization, the sense of right prioritization and
right investment in security. So it's a lot. And because this is a lot I get
back to what you just said. Because this is so much. There are many ways
in which we can open up and bring in more talent and more approaches to
the problem and try to enable more people in assisting in making
companies more resilient to cyber threats.

Dinis Cruz - 07:03
Yeah, if you look at, I would say, the qualities that you want in your
professionals is curiosity, ability to learn, ability to handle pressure, ability
to be a good team player, have a great cultural fit, ability to process lots
of complex information, be able to get things done and understand
complexity so you can get on right. And a lot of those are I would say
human and professional skills that have nothing to do with cybersecurity,
right? And yes, it's a lot in our field, but you could argue that it's also a lot
in the medical field, it's also a lot in other industries, right? Almost every
industry has a lot going on, right, in a lot of the stuff they do. So the
challenge there is, how do we give them those skills, right?

Dinis Cruz - 07:52
How do we give skills to that individual that is joining an industry that
doesn't have a huge background? And I think there's different paths. I
think there's a path where you're very technological and I think there's a
connection there, but there's also, I think, a path where you might not be
very technological, but you have a lot of engineering in a wider sense of
engineering sense, or a lot of structure or ability to consume a lot of
information sense. And I think each of those pillars require different
attitudes or different approaches for how you expose that individual to an
industry, which, like you said, there's a lot of stuff going on. But we also
invent the wheel a lot, right? We also sometimes overdramatize a lot of
these things in our industry because it's about the fundamentals, right?

Dinis Cruz - 08:39
It's about figuring out what you want to do, how you want to do it, how
you get it done, and enabling others. Because a lot of times in security, we
are a property of a system, right? We need to get the dev team or we need
to work with the dev team to implement certain things. We need to work
with engineering team to implement certain things. A lot of times we
shouldn't be doing it, we should be empowering, enabling, providing
guidance, providing information, or managing risk, et cetera, for other
teams to be productive. So a lot of those skills you can learn. So a lot of
those specific technicalities things you can learn.

Dinis Cruz - 09:15
I think my hypothesis is the other skill set is much harder to learn and the
talent pool that we go for these days is much smaller, which a lot of times
doesn't have those skills of. Basically. For example, I was talking to a
friend of mine and his wife, he's a teacher, right? And I think teachers are
amazing, right? I think teachers anybody who can teach a bunch of kids,
right, fucking it's a hell of a skill, right? And if you talk about managing
and keeping that in control and dealing with all the stuff and now there's
a lot of complexities in UK about it, but those individuals are amazing,
right? But they're actually not very well paid in a weird way.

Dinis Cruz - 09:56
We have a premium in cybersecurity that we should be leveraging because
it's almost like we need people to do transfer from one industry and
actually we can pay them more even to where they are, even if they don't
have domain expertise. Because at the moment, the premium is actually
really high. And you can argue that for the skill that the new generation
has, that premium is out of whack. It just happens to be a lot of demand.
Like you said when you started, when I was around initially there was no
cybersecurity teams, right. The market for cybersecurity professionals was
much lower to be hired as a threat modeler. What the hell? That wasn't
the thing. Right? And now a full blown career path, right?

Chen Gour-Arie - 10:40
Yeah, I think they've been trying to build in some universities, they're
already trying to build. They've been existing also for a while, full training
programs and full education programs around the subject. But I think one
of the challenging things here is that this subject is so much about other
topics. It's not so much a thing by itself is just to properly understand
information technologies and then try to find ways to inject some security
in them. If it's in the understanding the infrastructure and then from
understanding the infrastructure you can understand potential threats and
risks and then you need to understand how to deliver solutions to this. So
you have a long way to go. But I think that similar to how I spend a lot of
my time in a lot of my career in companies that build information
technology project.

Chen Gour-Arie - 11:45
So I live and breathe the DNA of companies that are building software.
And as you spend more and more time there at the beginning, you think
it's just a bunch of developers behind the keyboard. At some point you
start to realize that there are also product people and operation people.
Why would you need an operation person in a company that all they do is
build up software but you actually really need those operation people
because coordinating between the different efforts of the company is super
critical. Why do we need so much investment in product definition?
Because if you don't invest properly in product definition, you will have
your developers running about trying to build stuff that won't connect and
won't deliver to the actual needs of the user eventually. So you need to
actually invest more in product.

Chen Gour-Arie - 12:33
And then you even have things like marketing and people that are just
explaining what this should be explaining to the outside world, what this
should be to building up brand and marketing around it. And as you spend
more and more time in high tech and you realize how many different
professions are there in high tech, you can open up to the notion that it's
not necessarily about the technicality of things like you said before. It's
more about and especially in cybersecurity, it's more about mindshare,
mind, share of the organization. The successful cybersecurity professional
is the one that managed to convince as many different people in the
organization that this is important. They don't even need to understand
the single expert.

Chen Gour-Arie - 13:24
They just need to understand that eventually bringing security to a
company is just changing the mindset of the people and making them
aware of the problem eventually. Doesn't matter how good of a pen tester
you are. If the developers don't think so, it doesn't matter. You have to
convince them eventually. You have to convince their managers.

Dinis Cruz - 13:49
To.

Chen Gour-Arie - 13:50
Give you the budget and to put efforts into securing. And when you think
about this, like you said before, it opens up a lot of opportunities to loop in
more people, loop in operation people, loop in product people, loop in
marketing people. Marketing is super important for cybersecurity,
intelligent marketing, promoting the notion that we need to be more
careful with how we do things. You can just put a marketing person on
that job, just feed to them professionally with the right messaging, the
messaging that will be useful for developers and then they will be probably
more impactful than the best pen tester on the long term.

Dinis Cruz - 14:35
No, I agree. And I think the interesting challenge now is how can we
create jobs and help people in those transitions? Because the ones who are
hiring have in a way of responsibility to create jobs that allow those
individuals to make the jump. One of the things I try to do these days a lot
is to do internal seconds. So try to find other individuals in the company
that want to join a cybersecurity team, even just for a little bit, and then
that allows that transition to be smoother and that allows us to say, hey,
we got this project here that would be great if you can help. So that makes
a big difference. So Anthony has a good question here, which is what are
the good instructional schools and education we can obtain?

Dinis Cruz - 15:20
My main thing on this is like a I think in security you need to learn how to
hack. I think it's very important. I think there's something when you
exploit that, you understand a lot better what happens in here. And I think
a lot of the it's all about hands on experience, it's about having practical
understanding and doing some of these things for real. And for example,
open source communities are great because they need a lot of help and
they're always quite friendly. And I have to say, these days I would say
start with Chat GBT, start with Bard. But I think Chat GBT is still
probably the best one on this level and the next generation of education
bots are going to make a massive difference.

Dinis Cruz - 15:57
And I'm going to talk a little bit in the session, I'm going to work in a bit,
but I think that is going to be a massive change because Anthony, for
example, you will be able to create personalized training for you or for
whoever you know, that needs this, right? And that is super powerful
because you can say, here's the objectives, here's the topics, here's the
concepts, here's the things we want to cover, and now here's your
experience, here's what you know, this is the areas you're good at, the
areas you have good references. How do we now create a learning path, a
set of explanations, a set of knowledge that is completely customized to
the individual.

Dinis Cruz - 16:37
And I think that's a game changer because it allows somebody who
already has a lot of domain expertise to realize that those acquired skills
are actually not that far off from the more advanced cybersecurity skills
which might look very Chinese in the beginning, but actually they're just
variations of things that you probably already know. You just call them
different things.

Chen Gour-Arie - 17:00
I think that one thing that is kind of shared between all cybersecurity
professionals is that they promote thinking out of the box and trying to
think outside of the box. And then when you think about the title of this
session, how do we address the gap in cybersecurity? It could be
immediately our first response to think out of the box and the out of the
box here would be to try and find different ways of reaping value from
people that are interested in people are interested in. And if Anthony, if
you're interested, like exactly like Denny said, go about the thing that you
know, what brings you into the It industry? Obviously not the all of
cybersecurity is about the It industry. There are big parts of any industry
because every industry have it today.

Chen Gour-Arie - 17:52
But I would speak from it industry perspective because this is what I know
best. Think about all the profession that exists there in the It industry and
then if you're focusing, if you're already in this industry, you already have
a profession in this industry. Maybe you're a product manager, maybe
you're a developer, maybe you are in marketing, maybe you are in sales. If
you're already in this industry, try to find what would be the closest angle.
Of course you can go about formal training, like the list that you shared in
Chat. What kind of training and certifications? Recommended ones. I
personally, I admit I have none of these. I don't have CISSP, I have none of
these and I've been delivering security in many different organizations for
a very long time now. I don't have any formal education.

Chen Gour-Arie - 18:58
This is definitely a route that you can take to try and onboard one
program. I'd say go start with Udemy, start with acquiring knowledge
before trying to go for a certification. Maybe try and play around with bug
bounty programs. They're open. You can maybe try and bank over a
specific issue like corset scripting for example. Try to learn it, go to
Udemy, go to YouTube, learn about corset scripting and then go to bug
bounty programs and try to find one. And try to find corset scripting by
yourself. This will really create some appetite for more because if you find
one, you could actually get paid for it. And I've seen people start their
career this way.

Chen Gour-Arie - 19:45
I've seen people very successful today start and accelerated their career
this way by just learning about few classes of inabilities one by one and
then trying to find themselves. There are a lot of available resources to try
yourself, like look for vulnerable web applications. In Google, there are a
bunch of applications that can be used to try out, right? Yeah. Juice shop,
for example. Use juice shop and similar applications to try out and
experience yourself what it is to exploit applications. And then from there
take it to bug bounty programs and try in the real world, if your vector is
technical, if you're interested in trying out exploits, trying out, finding
vulnerabilities, this is definitely a way to go.

Dinis Cruz - 20:44
In the past, I was a lot more dismissive of certifications. I think it depends
where you are, and I think it depends on the path that you have available
to you. There's definitely places in the world that certification is a big
deal. I don't think I'm on that world. I don't think when we hire, that's
definitely not what we look for. We would never say, if you don't have the
certifications, you're not applicable for the job, right? Actually, I would
even argue that whoever does that, you don't want to work for them
because they're already looking at the wrong thing. That said, there is
value. If you like to study, if you're good at exams, that's a way to learn,
go for it, right? But I don't think you should view it as the primary, most
important thing.

Dinis Cruz - 21:29
If you get those compton ISC square, et cetera, it's not how you get those.
You get a job. Right. That's not how it works. And I don't think that's the
best way to learn. I think, again, some individuals care about it. I actually
really like the idea of starting to create customized, again, versions of that
based on what matters. Because the problem with a lot of those
certifications is that only 10% of it is interesting, right. The other is just
fluff, or the other is not relevant, or basically it's, okay, well, persuade
10% could be relevant to some things, right? But where you want to go or
what your skill set is not that good. Now, you mentioned also boot camps.
Now, these are interesting, and I've seen some really good ones. I'm sure
there's really bad ones.

Dinis Cruz - 22:14
But the boot camps have an interesting concept, at least the ones I've
seen, which is they take cohorts of individuals who have a lot of
experience, but for example, don't have security experience, or don't have
technology experience, or don't have development experience. And like, for
example, I would absolutely hire somebody who did a developer boot
camp, right? I think that's a great thing because I think development is a
really hard skill and somebody who's gone through it and understood and
knows version control and knows a lot of those things, that's actually
quite a really great skill. That is highly applicable. Yes, there's probably a
money grab there situation that you're talking about. I think you need to
be careful. Again, there's probably a lot of lemons in the market these
days.

Dinis Cruz - 22:59
I would look at what's the output, what did the people that took the
course, the boot camp did but some of them are quite good because it's a
three months intensive thing or six months or whatever it is and it's almost
driven by the market. So a lot of those actually give very highly
employable skills and it's all about the attitude, it's all about how you
approach it. So I think you be careful and again you could spend a lot of
money right and not advance a lot, right? I think there's lots of ways you
can start straight away to learn that doesn't require to spend a lot of
money on courses.

Chen Gour-Arie - 23:39
Yeah, I think that if you think about the subject of this talk I think maybe I
recognize now that the content for an individual is trying to enter the
cybersecurity market and try to become to work there is different than if
you talk to a company who's trying to bridge their gap in recruiting people
is completely different. And I think that if we have captured here
something in it together and I think that for the latter, for the companies
that are trying to find out how they can onboard more professionals open
up, think out of the box and try to find ways to enable people contribute to
cybersecurity from different angles. Because actually there are many
angles that have been neglected. There marketing I think is one of them.
Internal marketing, promoting the message.

Chen Gour-Arie - 24:32
If you look at even security frameworks, they would deduct a very big part
of the framework would be about publishing the data and the knowledge
inside of an organization. And this doesn't have to do anything with
knowing, with actually understanding cybersecurity, it's just understanding
messaging and how to talk about it. If you are an individual, I think that a
good thing to do would be to look at yourself and how you're usually
interested in learning things and acquiring new skills and new knowledge
and apply the same thing to this process. There is no right or wrong way
to do this, there is just opportunities all over the place. Many of them are
free. I don't think you should start with something that you pay for and
then just embark on a journey. But please understand it will be a journey.

Chen Gour-Arie - 25:28
It will take years until you'd get to a level of people that have been doing
this for a long time. But you could acquire a lot of knowledge quite
quickly if you use what's out there.

Dinis Cruz - 25:41
But here's the thing, right, and I've been trying to do this for a little while.
The fundamental requirement is you need to start to have an interest
passion, because some people show passion different ways but you need to
be maybe fascinated is a more better word. You need to fall in love with
cybersecurity, right? Because I think the nice thing of our industry is most
of the professionals, they absolutely love it. There's a passion about it,
there's a genuine sparkle in the eyes that you see in our profession, which
is great, by the way. I think it's one of the great things of our industry. And
I also feel that there is an interesting situation because cybersecurity is
quite a glamorous in one way career path. A lot of people talk about it.
There's good media promotion and then there's good salaries.

Dinis Cruz - 26:30
I do see people trying to cross that for the wrong reasons. And although I
do believe that if you do the right path, you will earn more, your career is
probably better path to have a higher income. And not that should be the
goal, but again, there's a path there. Doing that for those reasons is
wrong. I do feel that it's a great career, probably not for everybody, but
it's a really cool thing. And that's the feel that it's almost like individuals, I
want to get into cybersecurity. They need to find the sweet spot, they need
to find the area. And cybersecurity is massive. It's fucking huge in terms of
areas that they can really relate to. And more important, they can go, oh, I
could do that better. Marketing is a good example.

Dinis Cruz - 27:13
A marketing executive can look at how we communicate and go, and you
guys have no freaking idea, right? This is a shit show, right? I can do
better. I might not understand cybersecurity, but I know how to
communicate, right? He says Response somebody might go, this is a shit
show. The way you handle incidents. If we did that in a hospital, half our
patients would die, right? So I think there's also areas engineering. Give
me an area. I can find an example in cybersecurity that you can probably
add value. And the good news is that we're not a mature industry. The
good news is because the market keeps evolving, because the threats keep
evolving, because technology keeps evolving, and now we got the whole
GPT and AI world, which is another massive area.

Dinis Cruz - 27:55
The good news is you can still hack your way into the industry, like you
could still do what we did. I would argue that we hacked our way into the
industry. We didn't had a lot of formal stuff. We just stumbled across,
became good, gained reputation, got hired and it went from there. So it's
still a good moment to join the industry and I think we need a lot of new
blood and new ideas and new experiences. And it could be a work from
home mom, right? It could be somebody who's joined a bunch of other
stuff who wants to join. Or it could be somebody who wants to go the next
level of their career. I think there's a lot of really cool opportunities.

Chen Gour-Arie - 28:28
Agreed. I think that it's actually a very good timing because the evolution
of this is due. It's really required now that I think the same as information
technology is now maturing to a level where people have been shouting,
agile, do this, do that. But now it's already been through, I'd say, second
phase of evolution where people realize that even agile is not just a magic
solution and you need to have more. And the different professions inside
information technologies industry are evolving to become something much
more professional. Like, if you compare agriculture or other industries
that have been there for a very long time, you see the level of knowledge
and professionality that the humankind have around these is much more
mature than what we have information technology.

Dinis Cruz - 29:29
Put us to shame every day.

Chen Gour-Arie - 29:31
Yeah, it's amazing to see and it's amazing to realize this. And then if you
think about cybersecurity, it's even behind it's playing catch. And this is a
really good timing because as we can all see, it's really, truly necessary
that people will get.

Dinis Cruz - 29:47
The stuff figured out and the exacts pay attention. Right. Like,
cybersecurity is a top level risk for a company. It's not a low risk. And to
be honest, we get this wrong, our customers suffer. Right. Our financing
company suffers. Right. Or whatever you're trying to protect. So it's a real
thing. Right. I like the fact that I make my customers safe. We make a
difference by keeping their data, their assets, their experience, the trust.
We protect it. So I think it's a really cool career, right. And it's always
learning. There's always new stuff, there's always new things to learn. And
the thing that Anthony, you just said I think is interesting is to say the path
is hard to figure out where you can land. I would challenge that a little bit.

Dinis Cruz - 30:35
I think you need to find a path that you are already going and then do a
Tweak on it, on security.

Chen Gour-Arie - 30:43
Right.

Dinis Cruz - 30:44
Like, whatever career you're in, you're already in a career path, even if
you're learning it, if you're a student, doesn't matter. There's already
things that you love to do or you think you have a certain seller skill set.
That's where you want to align yourself. Right. You want to align yourself
with that. So I think sometimes it's easy to overbake this, easy to say, well,
I should go there. No, a lot of this is just try to do it, try to protect
yourself, try to protect your family, try to look wherever you are. It doesn't
matter if you're a student or a professional work for a company. There will
be a cybersecurity team that you can touch, that you can go in there and
say, hey, I want to be a security champion. I want to help out, I want to be
involved.

Dinis Cruz - 31:23
What can I do? Right? And open. Source projects. Like just volunteer,
right? Hack your way into the project.

Chen Gour-Arie - 31:30
Yeah, exactly.

Dinis Cruz - 31:31
That's the best way to do it.

Chen Gour-Arie - 31:33
Yeah. One of the key tenants here is think out of the box. Hack your way.
Hack your way into it. I think this would be the best if we're talking about
people trying to get in. Hack your way in. No rules. The only rule about it,
there is no rules.

Dinis Cruz - 31:48
Yeah. That's how most of us do it, right? Always be on the good side of the
force, by the way. Always be at the coach. Never do anything for personal
gain at that level. But apart from that, right? It's like, be out there and
find that path. And the gen AI stuff is massive because for the first time,
you can create a prompt that says, I do this to my friends. I write prompts
where I say, I'm this person. I have this experience. I have this and this.
What should I do? Actually, let me literally read you this, right? A friend of
mine is a PE teacher. Literally I literally wrote this. Let me just find it.
Which I think was a really good way to what's it called? Yeah. There you
go. Look. See, I literally wrote this, right? I'm X name.

Dinis Cruz - 32:47
I'm a teacher. I'm just reading, really, the prompt I created right when I
was with him, right in the car. I'm a teacher in London, has ten years
experience. I'm good with managing people. He wrote this. He wrote the
first part of it. He says, I'm a teacher in London, has ten years of
experience. I'm good with managing people, and I'm good at listening,
problem solving and resolving conflict. I love football. I'm a really good
team player, have strong ethics and values. I believe in happy and
productive teams. I had enough of my job. I'm frustrated with my current
career.

Chen Gour-Arie - 33:16
Send over the CV, please.

Dinis Cruz - 33:18
And I'm frustrated with my current job. I am looking for a career change.
And what are good options for me, right? I literally typed it. And then
again, what are good jobs for me in cybersecurity, right? And then Chat
GPT answered, hey, with your background in teaching, manage complex
people in conflict resolution, coupled with a strong ethics and team play
attitude, you are positioned to transition to cybersecurity. Here's a step for
you. Education and certification. Leverage your skills. Cybersecurity
Awareness and Training incident Response Team. Do some networking,
get some soft skills, blah, blah. Start small, stay updated, tell your CV and
that's it. So, literally, at this level. And then Chat GPT is cool because you
can go, okay, can you zoom in on this? Can you give me a five action plan?
Can you give me a three week schedule?

Dinis Cruz - 34:04
Just learn how to use it. In fact, Chat GPT at the moment, llams is a great
way to enter the industry. Because I'm telling you, half our industry
doesn't have a freaking clue. That's what I'm going to speak next, right?
Literally, they don't have a clue and they totally deers in headlights. So if
you even become half proficient in Chat GBT, you can use Chat GPT to get
you the job. And you should be hired just because of those skills. The same
way that people ten years ago were hired because they knew the internet,
like, hey, they want to hire a designer. We have ten designers. They're all
pretty good. You know the internet, there you go, we hire you. That was it,
right? And so those are the opportunities.

Chen Gour-Arie - 34:44
I think that Denzel and I were roughly the same age from that. I know
that we got our way into this industry, like you said before, by hacking our
way through. So I think this would be our most Jupiter recommendation.
Hack your way through what was just suggested here. Use Jet GPT to help
you find your personal ending point. I think it's fascinating. It's really cool.

Dinis Cruz - 35:13
And look, by the way, hack just from a historical point of view is actually a
good thing, right? Like hacking, you know, was taken by the media. But
hack is finding a problem. Hacking is MacGyver, right? For the ones it's
basically when you have a problem and you find a solution and you put it
together and you find a way to get it done. That was actually what's called
a hack in the early days. And that's what we would do in websites.
Somebody would put a website, put an application for a network, and we
will find ways to do things that were not supposed to be used like that. But
we're like, hey, guess what, it's possible. And here's the problem, here's the
implication. You just immediate that make it bad.

Dinis Cruz - 35:50
So when we say hack your way into it is finding that it's problem solving,
is figuring out how to go to the next step.

Chen Gour-Arie - 35:58
I think that it is worth mentioning that in order to be really proficient, and
especially if you want to choose the engineering journey, the technical
journey, you need to learn a lot and you need to learn a lot about
information technologies, about computers, about how software works.
I'd say it's not so easy, but you have to start somewhere. So I'd
recommend, if you're inclined to do the engineering path, the technical
path I'd recommend, learn about communication, computer
communication. Learn a little bit of coding with publicly available
resources. Try to create your own first web application using React.
Maybe go and try to follow step by step creating a React app today, it's
quite easy. Setting up dependencies is quite easy. You'd start with
something like a vite application. Vite. Try to go over the first step
instructions on how to do this.

Chen Gour-Arie - 37:08
Get yourself familiar with how technology work, how computer
communication work. You won't figure out everything in the first week or
even months, but the more you learn about it will create an appetite for
learning more. And then if you go with things like juice shop or other
training applications, we combine these two, the growing knowledge
around information technologies and software development, with the
appetite to try and break them and try to find loopholes and hack them. I
think this would set you up on a path, if technical path is what you are
looking for. But like you said, there are many other ways to get there.

Dinis Cruz - 37:50
But the key I think you touch is you need to learn, right? And let's be clear,
right? If you're trying to get an industry, you have a handicap. Let's just be
very transparent. You are competing with individuals that industry have
more experience. I would argue that if you come with a whole bag of other
experiences, you have a competitive advantage against those individuals
because you have a wider pool of talent and pool experiences, again, to
bring not cybersecurity, but others. But you need to learn, right? There is
no shortcut here. In a way, the learning, if you don't like to learn, then
that's a problem. But if you love to learn or if you enjoy learning, then it's
a good thing, right? I think that makes a big difference.

Dinis Cruz - 38:28
And also in terms of where to start, look, the Open Security Summit, in a
way, if you think about it, with the speakers that you have here, with the
community, with the people involved, there's enough employers, right, to
hire a lot of people. But what I sometimes find fascinating is that why
aren't a new generation a lot more involved? Like the Open Security
Summit needs a lot more volunteers, needs a lot of people to help. There's
a lot of stuff to do. There's a lot of things that don't happen because
there's not enough time, because it's all like volunteer driven, right?
Including my time. Right? So open source is a great way to be involved.
Communities like this, communities like Oasp, right? They're amazing
communities. And guess what? You can be hired through you.

Dinis Cruz - 39:08
If you involve and you help somebody, they're going to go, oh, I have an
opportunity for you. And then it's a personal recommendation. And that
makes the whole difference because it's suddenly like there's somebody
who's more emotional connected to helping you, and they might give you
good guidance, good mentoring, and a lot of those individuals are there.
But you guys need to do the first job jump, which is be involved, help
figure out where you can add value and try it out. The worst thing that
can happen, you ignored that's. All right? At least you learn something. So
that's the thing, right? And we failed a lot. We always try these things. And
as long as you try and you learn and you recent repeat, eventually you find
your sweet spot and also work with people that you have the same values,
right?

Dinis Cruz - 39:53
There's lots of good people in cybersecurity. There's lots of bad people in
cybersecurity. There's lots of people doing cybersecurity for the wrong
reasons. There's a lot of people on areas of cybersecurity that have
questionable ethics don't need to go to those. Right. There's others who
are doing great stuff, work for great companies, or doing some great
things. Right. So it's quite big. Right. So align with your ethics, with what
you want to do, how you want to learn, and then take you from there.

Chen Gour-Arie - 40:16
Absolutely. Everywhere.

Dinis Cruz - 40:19
Cool. All right, man. I think we're just wrapping up. Any final words from
you?

Chen Gour-Arie - 40:26
No, I think we've said it all. Especially I think I agreed a lot with what
Denise said. Get connected with your own, with what you're good at. Try
to use this as your penetration vector. To get in it. You have to learn. You'll
have to learn some things. I personally recommend try to take in a lot of
information about information technology. Or you could also think of it as
a completely different thing. If you're not taking the technical and
engineering journey, there are many options in I wouldn't jump straight to
pay for education. Education is available for free. For your first steps, you
should definitely be able to do it for free. And then when you see that's the
right way for you, maybe you can also think of some paid education. But
don't start with this.

Dinis Cruz - 41:23
Dalio, you're joining in. Come on. What's your views on this?

Chen Gour-Arie - 41:29
We can't hear you.

Dinis Cruz - 41:30
We can't hear you.

Chen Gour-Arie - 41:42
Now. We can hear you now.

Dinis Cruz - 41:43
We can.

Speaker 3 - 41:47
Yeah. I just want to thank you for the session. It's always nice to learn
with you guys. I'm Deldio. I'm working now in It development. I'm
working as a quality assurance analyst. And I relate a lot to what Dinesh
said in the beginning. My background is in biochemistry. I was a teacher
for roughly three years, and after a few years, I started working in It, first
as a business analyst and later on as a tester. And, yeah, I continue the
journey and try and hack my way into the field, but no rush. I want to be
sure on what I'm doing. So I continue to be interested in the cybersecurity
field or industry, as it's becoming an industry.

Dinis Cruz - 42:33
Right.

Speaker 3 - 42:34
Or as you prefer to call it. The other day I attended Lisbon chapter
session, so I think I'm still trying to find out if I'm in love, if I'm really in
love with cybersecurity, and finding out if I'm up to the journey, basically.
And today I was in the office and I managed to fit this session in my
schedule. So I'll continue my journey and probably I'll try to hack my way
into the field.

Dinis Cruz - 42:58
Brilliant. I think I'm presenting in the London Lisbon chapter next month.
I think I'm just waiting for final confirmation. So might see you be could
be, yeah. You are a great example of a lot of I would say, the talent that
we need in our industry. One of the big elephants that always been I guess
I come from a developer background, so I guess it was a bit rich of me to
say this, but I always felt that if you understand development, you can't
really do AppSec, right? Like, literally. And a lot of the problems we have
in our industry is caused by even us as an industry or parts of our industry,
dictating AbSec stuff to engineers who know 100 times more on that on
the other side. And it's kind of like, dude, what the hell? Right?

Dinis Cruz - 43:46
You should understand how we operate, then give me guidance. And in a
weird way, it's not the cybersecurity professional fault, too, because it's
very skewed, right? Like, you're telling you we're asking for cybersecurity
professionals to understand about frameworks and this and development
and that workflow and this thing and that. The list is massive, which is
why I also think that the Gen AI and the agents that are coming next will
make a massive difference because it allows us to communicate in a much
better language so we can start to talk about the intent that we want to do
in security. But in your world, you understand about how to deliver code.
You understand how to deliver effective solutions, right? Like, come on,
man. Some of the cybersecurity teams, we're the worst ones, right?

Dinis Cruz - 44:25
Like, if you look at some of our development practices, if you look at how
even cybersecurity products, man, fucking out, like, some of the products,
literally, you think they should know better, right? But again, it's the same
problem. They have a problem. They're shipping to market. They go out
there by the time they're successful, it's lots of legacy stuff, and then they
become just like the other vendors that we sometimes have problem from
a security point of view, but they just happen to do a security product. But
I think that transition from QA to security, especially in development,
should not be that hard because you have a level of maturity that is
missing in lots of areas in the cybersecurity world.

Dinis Cruz - 45:07
And I would argue that even if you just do cybersecurity for a couple of
years, when you go back to your maybe QA is your passion or
development is your passion and you want to do maybe that path, you'll
better. I was a CTO for a while, and I can totally say that my definition of
what's possible was very different from the other engineers. In fact, I
would have to argue with other engineers about what was possible, and I
was like, Dude, this is your world. Why don't you get it? Like, okay, it's not
how it's supposed to be doing, but it works, right? So I found that even
sometimes the development teams and QA teams and engineering teams
get siloed, right? And insecure, you learn to question everything. You learn
the power of well, I know it was not supposed to be possible.

Dinis Cruz - 45:52
I know it was not supposed to work, but I just made it work. Right. And
then you understand how. So I think the curiosity is really cool in security,
because we can go deep. Right.

Chen Gour-Arie - 46:04
That's my experience as well. If you start from security, you open up a lot
of possibilities in software development because you adapt this kind of no
borders kind of thinking. You will always challenge the information
around you to see to find loopholes, and it opened up a good position for
continuing your career in engineering everywhere.

Dinis Cruz - 46:29
Exactly. Cool. All right, guys, thanks for participating. We'll share the
video, and I really want to figure out how to use Nargen AI to really
augment some of these topics, because I think we have a lot of great
content already on a particular summit, but it kind of gets lost. So I think
another we move the needle a little bit further. So, again, thanks, Jan, for
being part of it and helping with this session.

Chen Gour-Arie - 46:52
My pleasure. Thank you very much.
