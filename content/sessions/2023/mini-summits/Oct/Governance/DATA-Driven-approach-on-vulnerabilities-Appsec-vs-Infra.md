## About this session
Navigating through the pulsating neural networks of cybersecurity, this session brings to the fore a meticulously crafted exploration into a DATA-Driven Approach towards understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities in both AppSec and Infrastructural security spheres.

Vulnerabilities are more than mere code anomalies; they are the conduits that can potentially unchain a cascade of unwanted cyber events. In this awe-inspiring panel, join a squadron of cybersecurity mavens who will steer you through an introspective journey deep into the core of vulnerability complexity, reachability, exploitability, and the dense fog of contextual risk.

## ðŸš€ Key Takeaways:

Unveiling Complexity: Dissecting vulnerabilities to comprehend their intrinsic and extrinsic complexity.
Psychology of Risk: Unmasking the psychological underpinning that influences stakeholders and drives critical security decisions.
Diverse Vulnerabilities: Traversing the variegated landscape of vulnerabilities, exploring their diverse nature, and approaching mitigation with perspicacity.
Dimension of Risk: Engaging in a riveting discourse on deployment amidst diverse risks, and tactfully managing them in the volatile cyberspace.
The session promulgates an enriched discussion that intends to shift your perspective from merely dealing with vulnerabilities to strategically navigating through them, with a DATA-driven compass guiding the way. Whether you're an Application Security expert, an Infrastructure Security professional, or a cyber enthusiast keen to expand your knowledge horizons, this session promises a blend of expert insights, tangible takeaways, and a forward-looking perspective on dealing with vulnerabilities.

Prepare to launch into a session where data meets depth, and experts decode the enigmatic realms of vulnerabilities in Appsec and Infra. It's not just a session; it's an expedition into the future of secure, savvy, and strategic cybersecurity.
