## About this session
Posture and Data don’t lie - risk and fact-driven approach on posture management with deep dive into exploitability, reliability and the likelihood of exploitation.

### Abstract
Posture is the art of representing complex problems in simple risk-based visualization. Risk posture had a lot of hidden measurements and data and was treated like esoteric art. In this talk, we explore various concepts like Exploitation, the likelihood of exploitability, Context and location of an asset and how it influences the exploitability, business impact and how to involve business with risk-based driven metrics.
The talk focus on data-driven research and visualisation techniques analysing what’s more exploitable from different data sources.
We will explore the difference between a vulnerability base approach and resolution first vs a risk-based approach and success from real case scenarios.
Find your path in this modern, challenging.
