## Irius Risk

IriusRisk is the industry's leading threat modeling company. Its powerful threat modeling platform empowers organizations to build security into application design, resulting in improved speed to market, collaboration across security and development teams, and the avoidance of costly security design flaws.

IriusRisk enables teams to create a diagram of their product architecture and automatically generate a list of threats, plus the countermeasures required to fix them, within minutes. IriusRisk assesses the diagram against key security standards and regulations to not only highlight product weaknesses but also gaps in compliance - before a line of code is even written. Having a clear understanding of the security requirements before development eliminates the rework and delay experienced during testing.

Its self-service design opens up secure design to non-security teams, such as development and engineering, with minimal impact on their workflow. It integrates with major issue trackers to synchronize fixes directly into the developer workflow, so it does not disturb their task management processes. You don’t have to be a security expert to use it, plus it naturally promotes a greater security culture across your organization.

Whether you have 1, 10, 1000, 10000+ applications, IriusRisk scales with your architecture and application portfolio, and will help you create a continuous process of secure design that satisfies your organization’s own internal, unique security and compliance requirements.
