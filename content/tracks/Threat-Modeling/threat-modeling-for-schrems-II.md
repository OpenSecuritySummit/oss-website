## Session Description

In preparation for the [Security Labels & Schrems II](/tracks/security-labels/security-labels-and-schrems-ii/) 
 session that is happening on Thursday, in this session we will be executing a Threat Model exercise aimed at
 mapping out the multiple Threat Modeling components of the scenarios affected by "Schrems II" (Threat Actors,
 Data Flows, Use Cases, Security Boundaries, Vulnerabilities and Risks) 
 
 

### Schrems II 
 
As per the Schrems II ruling, the US is no longer an adequate country for EU personal data. 
 BCS recently did a recent webinar on the legal aspects which you can see [here](https://www.bcs.org/content-hub/webinar-what-do-you-need-to-know-about-schrems-ii/)
  
So far, the ICO guidance in the UK is to map your data flows in preparation for further guidance.
