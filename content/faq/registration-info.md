#### 1. How do I update my schedule and register for working sessions?

    1. Use your Hey Summit account

If you have any difficulties in updating your schedule, please reach out on slack in the #oss-helpdesk channel.


#### 2. I don't have a profile page, how do I register as a participant on GitHub?

There are two types of participants - Onsite and Remote.

- To register as a participant:

   Please make a copy of the [participant template]({{< ref "/participant/_template.md" >}}) and save it in the same folder (https://github.com/OpenSecuritySummit/oss2020/tree/master/content/participant).

If you are going to contribute to a working session, it makes sense to fork the repo and push your changes (https://github.com/OpenSecuritySummit/oss2020).
