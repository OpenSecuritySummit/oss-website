title: Session not found
---

If you see a red link like this (when you map a working or user session):

{{<img-border src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/656739/38472235-fc1ccd02-3b74-11e8-9935-fe4ec7a060b0.png"
       width="300"
       border="1px solid" >}}

It means that

**There is a typo on the session title**

Try searching in the [oss2019](https://github.com/OpenSecuritySummit/oss2019) GitHub repository for it

or

**The session doesn't exist:**

In that case please create one using [this template](https://github.com/OpenSecuritySummit/oss2020/blob/master/content/working-sessions/_template.md)
