### I'm interested in specifics about a session. Who can help me?
We created separate Slack channels for every session. ([Join us]((https://join.slack.com/t/os-summit/shared_invite/enQtMzY4NTk4MzYxNDExLTZjMDFlNDc5YTBkNDU1ZWM5NjM2MDNlZjI0Njc5MDc1NDljOGZjMjliYzNkOTA3OWEyMzczMzI2MjgyYzZlMzc)) on Slack)\
You can find all those channels monitored by our team, on `os-summit.slack.com` workspace.\
As a shortcut, you can use clue button <img src="/img/pages/slack_message.png" alt="slack" style="height: 26px;"/> displayed on every session page, which will redirect you to the Slack channel for the session respectively.
