#### 1. **What infrastructure will be available at the Venue?**

We will try to set up some Docker servers and maybe even a Kubernetes or Open Stack setup, depending on needs/time.

Also, we need to run a local copy of the Summit site there (together with its ELK monitoring stack).

This setup should be reachable from the Venue network, and its initial purpose will be to have the Summit site and other test sites like [JuiceShop] <!-- this was 2017 link (../../Working-Sessions/Owasp-Projects/Juice-Shop.html) -->

#### 2. **What should I do if I need to run X on that infrastructure?**

If X can be run on the infrastructure set up at the Venue, it can be hosted there.

You are welcome to bring your own hardware.
