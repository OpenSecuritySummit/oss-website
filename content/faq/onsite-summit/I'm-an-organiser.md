### What are my responsibilities?
The organizer's primary responsibility is to create the most effective and productive working session environment for the participants.

The organizer's main duties cover Working Session content & outcomes. The energy you bring to your working session will significantly impact its success.
  
#### How should I prepare for the session I'm organizing?
As the organizer, you should have a clear idea of what will happen during the Working Session, as this will allow each session to create something tangible and actionable.

Working Session organizers should create detailed action plans and to-dos lists that are easy to pick up and start contributing to (we recommend you use GitHub Issues and Projects).

Each organizer should collaborate with the registered participants of their working session to identify and define what the 'Outcomes' of their Working Session(s) will be, as these will affect the location and duration of that Working Session in the main Summit schedule.

Next, add those outcomes to the appropriate Working Session in https://github.com/OpenSecuritySummit/oss2019/tree/main/content/tracks.

Please don't wait for the Summit to start thinking/sharing/working on either your Working Session or its outcomes. Proper preparation and planning will help to ensure productivity and dynamism.
  
### What resources and support will be available to me?
* Meeting room
* AV equipment
* Stationery
* Outcome team/content support (where available)
* Please create a Pull Request or email info@opensecsummit.org with any questions or requests.
  
### How do I invite participants (both on-site and remote)?
On-site: Edit your session page and add an 'invite' field under participants. Then add the names of the people you wish to invite. Your invitation will show on their schedule. You should also message them on Slack.

Remote: You can share the Google Meet URL with people who are interested in joining remotely.
Meet URLs will be available from 10:00 p.m., Sunday, 14 June 2020.
  
### What should the session outcomes look like?
Here are some examples of what these outcomes/deliverables could look like:

* Artefacts (Diagrams)
* Documents or Books
* Playbooks
* Roadmaps (for next meeting)
* Wiki pages (namely on owasp.org)
* Code
* Statement or Position (signed by the Working Sessions Participants)
* Security Review (or a particular application or API)
* Lessons Learned
  
### How do I produce the outcomes?

As mentioned above, organizers should collaborate with the other participants in the session to identify what the potential session outcomes might be. The outcomes will be created in a GitHub Pull Request.

### After the session ends, what are the next steps?
Finalize your session outcomes and create a Pull Request. The content team may clarify any queries with you via the Pull Request.
