Remote URLs will be available from 10:00 p.m., Sunday, 14 June 2020.

### How do the sessions work for remote participants?

### What is expected of me as a remote participant?
The expectations of remote participants are the same as for on-site participants. Each of the Summit's 140+ working sessions will create a published deliverable for the wider InfoSec Community to engage with. This high level of productivity does require some essential commitments from the attendees, including participation, mutual respect, and [radical candour](https://www.radicalcandor.com/). For more information, see [here](https://open-security-summit.org/faq/attendee-information/). 

### How can I get involved?
The OSS Summit is a participant-driven event, dedicated to the collaboration of Development and Security professionals, with a strong focus on DevSecOps. 

### Can I invite others to join?
You can share the Google Meet URL with people who are interested in joining remotely.
Meet URLs will be available from 10:00 p.m., Sunday, 3 June 2018.
