### What should I do when I arrive at Center Parcs?
When you arrive at Center Parcs, follow the 'all traffic' signs. At the arrivals lodge, you will be met by security. Let them know that you are attending the Open Security Summit in 'The Venue'.

### I haven't received a ticket, what should I do?
This year, we've gone paperless! We are not issuing physical tickets, you should have received joining instructions via email, this confirms your place at the Open Security Summit. 

### I have travelled from outside the UK, do you provide power adapters?
We do not provide power adapters to Summit participants. It is unlikely that local shops will supply these. We recommend you purchase adapters at the airport as you may struggle to find these elsewhere.

### Is tap water safe to drink in the UK?
UK tap water meets The Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2016 and is perfectly safe to drink. Bottled water is available for purchase in Center Parcs outlets.

### Will I be sharing a room?
Center Parcs offers bedrooms with either a double bed (double room) or two single beds (twin room). 
Double rooms are single occupancy, these have been allocated to those who have made special requests, on a first come, first served basis. 
Twin rooms will hold two participants, if you have been allocated a twin room, you may have a roommate. 
It is your responsibility to arrange bedroom allocations with your housemates. You should be considerate of those who have requested and been allocated a single occupancy room.  
Where possible, we have allocated rooms for single occupancy; however, this is not always feasible.
Special requests must be submitted, in writing by 26 May 2020.

### When will I get my key?
Keys will be distributed by the Summit registration desk at 16:30 on the day of your arrival.

### Where can I store my luggage?
The Summit registration desk will direct you to luggage storage. Property is left in luggage storage, at the owner's risk.
