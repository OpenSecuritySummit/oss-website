## Ticket FAQs

### I have a ticket, but I'm no longer able to attend, can I get a refund?
Our refund policy for the Open Security Summit is as follows:

 - Attendees wishing to cancel their ticket before 20 May 2021 are eligible for a full refund
 - Attendees wishing to cancel their ticket between 21 - 27 May 2021 are eligible for a 50% refund (excluding processing fees)
 - Attendees wishing to cancel their ticket after 28 May 2021 do not qualify for a refund.

### I have a ticket, but I'm no longer able to attend, can I transfer my ticket to someone else?
You can transfer your ticket to another person until 27 May 2021. Transfers are not possible after this date.

### What is your official statement on Covid 19?
Thanks again for your continued support. Understandably, we have received many queries as to whether we will postpone the summit, due to the escalation of the COVID-19 outbreak.

This yearsâ€™ Open Security Summit will go ahead remotely; there will be no onsite participation. Between 15-19 June 2020, you will be able to access online working sessions through video conferencing. The current Working Sessions will be restructured to support 100% remote participation, and the schedule will be fine-tuned accordingly.

The physical Open Security Summit has been rescheduled until 14-18 June 2021. All sponsorship and registrations have been transferred to the new dates.

### Why are you charging for remote tickets for the online summit?
While our costs are significantly reduced with an online summit, we do still incur costs for technology, writers, support and other expendables.
The Open Security Summit is a not-for-profit community interest company. All funds received through sponsorship and ticket sales is invested into the sustainable future of the company. Further details can be found in the /oss-structure/ page.
