The online-only Open Security Summit sessions are a series of events that bring together 
security experts and professionals from around the world to discuss the latest trends 
and challenges in cyber and application security. 

These sessions are held online (via Zoom), to allow for a wide range of participants to attend, 
regardless of their location.

During these sessions, attendees can expect to hear from keynote speakers, 
panel discussions, and presentations on a variety of topics.

Some of the topics that may be covered include threat modeling, security governance, threat intelligence, 
incident response, security operations, and security automation. Attendees will also have the opportunity to network 
with other security professionals and learn about the latest tools and technologies to help protect 
their organizations from cyber threats.

The online-only format of these sessions also allows for more flexibility and convenience 
for attendees. They can join from anywhere and participate in the sessions live or on-demand 
at their own time and pace. Additionally, the sessions are recorded and made available for 
later viewing, so attendees can catch up on any sessions they may have missed or 
want to review again. 

Overall, the online-only Open Security Summit sessions provide a valuable opportunity for 
security professionals to stay current and up-to-date on the latest developments.
