Each of the 140+ working sessions will create a published deliverable for the wider InfoSec Community to engage with. This high level of productivity does require commitments from the attendees. As an Open Security Summit Attendee we hold you to these expectations:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"participation\"\u003eParticipation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key to the Open Security Summit is its participatory nature. Unlike a conference, attendees are expected to immerse themselves in each working session, collaborating to create a published deliverable in a compressed amount of time. The expectation is that every attendee will actively engage with their peers to create this during the event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"mutual-respect\"\u003eMutual Respect\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will be engaging in intense, creative activity with your peers. Sometimes the topic you will be dealing may be divisive. The basis for all conversations and growth during the Summit must be mutual respect. Every interaction with your fellow Summit attendees must at heart recognize that everyone is here to make AppSec better - even if we disagree about how to go about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMutual respect also includes making space for others to talk. Be sensitive to not dominating the conversation during your working session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"challenge-directly\"\u003eChallenge Directly\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen participating in the event, you are expected to say what you think plainly so that your working session team can quickly and thoroughly confront the issues they are there to respond to. This is the place to engage, not hold back out of misguided fear of challenging ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease use \u003ca href=\"https://www.radicalcandor.com/\"\u003eRadical Candor\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"care-deeply\"\u003eCare Deeply\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis doesn’t mean that you are allowed to tear down others. While challenging directly, you are expected to remember that this is a collaborative environment. The goal is to communicate your critiques with the heart and collegial spirit that is due to your Summit colleagues. This means that consideration and thoughtfulness should guide your words without stifling constructive criticism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"objective-distance-and-personal-criticism\"\u003eObjective Distance and Personal Criticism\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou may have passionate opinions about many of the items we will be discussing: this is a good thing. However, you are expected to be able to examine each issue with an objective distance. This means that as we attempt to create consensus (or simply consider where it cannot be found), you are expected to weigh the ideas of others without subordinating them to your own preconceived ideas unduly. This also needs to be applied to your Summit colleagues as you may reencounter them during the Summit after such passionate disagreement. You are expected to be able to deal with each issue from a fresh perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll criticism during the Open Security Summit must be directed at the topics of your working session. Personal criticisms will derail conversations and undermine the collaborative atmosphere; this will not be tolerated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"offer-supporting-documents-for-value-judgments\"\u003eOffer Supporting Documents for Value Judgments\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen offering a value judgment (such as that idea does not work/is bad/is the best), you must offer proof or supporting documentation for your opinion and keep your point constructive to the conversation as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"be-solution-focused\"\u003eBe Solution Focused\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen noting that an action is sub-par, you should always propose a solution that will address your critiques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"harassment\"\u003eHarassment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Open Security Summit is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of Summit participants in any form in any Summit venue, including working sessions, social events, or other channels of communication. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: inappropriate questioning, sustained personal criticism, unwelcome and uninvited following or touching, and repeated unwelcome cornering of individuals away from the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you need to report harassment, please contact a member of the Open Security Summit team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Summit participant who violates these rules will be confronted immediately.

To this end, the Venue is organized into a series of villas that are supplemented by the conference centre (conveniently named The Venue). The villas will serve the dual purpose of accommodation as well as locations for the more informal evening sessions. Some venues will also serve as locations for standard working sessions (these will be marked on the schedule).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"accommodation-faqhahahugoshortcode24s4hbhb\"\u003eAccommodation (\u003ca href=\"https://open-security-summit.org/faq/onsite-summit/accommodation/\"\u003eFAQ\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you arrive at Woburn Forest Center Parcs proceed to the conference centre (conveniently called The Venue), you will receive your house key and accommodation information package upon registering.

As there are no locks on bedroom doors, we advise you not to leave valuables lying around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou need to have everything out of your room/villa by 10:00am. on the day you leave; you can leave luggage at the registration desk in the Venue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"schedule\"\u003eSchedule\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"session-timings\"\u003eSession timings\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSessions are 60 minutes long.

id=\"about-this-session\"\u003eAbout this session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s address the elephant in the room — “Shift left” hasn’t had the impact on our software security as many of us expected it to have. While it does have much merit and has influenced security in an indispensable way, I argue that “shift left” should be viewed as a tactic in a larger management strategy rather than a comprehensive solution to solve application security woes. Just as software development is a very complicated process with many layers, “shift left” should not be viewed as a straightforward, linear effort. This presentation will review the success, concerns and potential of “shift left”  and how we can “restart” the process by applying it a little differently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"session-transcript\"\u003eSession Transcript:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 00:00\nHi. Welcome to this open Security Seven session in April 2023. And we\nhave Chen here, which is going to expand on why shift left isn\u0026rsquo;t what you\nexpected. We already had some interesting conversations before and we\u0026rsquo;re\nlooking forward to see where Chen is taking this from. Over to you, Jen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 00:19\nAll right, thank you very much for having me and thank you for the\nopportunity to talk about this subject here. So I\u0026rsquo;m Chen, I live in Tel Aviv.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a co founder and chief architect of Endosecurity. My passion is around\nbuilding things, but professionally I\u0026rsquo;ve been more busy with breaking them\nfor, I guess the beginning of my career was a pen tester for many years\nand then that led me to take more and more interest in the side of\nsoftware engineering. I think the second half is more about engineering\ncyber solutions and so I can still be active on these two realms. What we\nare building at Tenzo is an SPM solution. We are building it to allow\nsustainable and scalable AppSec by working on building all the bits and\npieces that are necessary to be able to list all your assets. Also in the same\nway, to list all your controls and get some feedback on the status that you\nhave in each control so you can handle and focus on the critical alerts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 01:26\nThis is a very interesting experience to build this kind of innovative\napplication, but it takes us into places that we need to really think about\nhow this is done and what\u0026rsquo;s inside in application security as a realm,\nwhat\u0026rsquo;s going on inside so many frameworks, so many ways to approach\nthe problem and think about it so naturally. Because our flow is to list an\nasset and then understand the controls and then measure the controls.\nDefense metrics approach is very relevant to adopt as a way of thinking\nabout this. This is some of the work of one of our advisors, Sonilu, and it\u0026rsquo;s\nabout thinking about the problem in a way that you use NIST security\nfunction and then list down the areas of technology that you have and\nyour application. We are here in this tier and then you think of how to\ncombine the right combination of technology, people and processes in a\nway that will allow you to make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re covered in each and\nevery one of these activities, these functions of security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 02:33\nThis approach is very systematic and this is why we attend. So we relate to\nit very much. It builds on a well adapted structure of security functions,\nframework, and then you also drill down on each area and you think you\nhave three tools at hand. It\u0026rsquo;s always a solution, a technology, a process\nthat you can try to adapt throughout the organization and the people that\nyou can operate within it when each and every one of them have the pros\nand cons building too much on process can create antagonism and can\nbreak down in different places. You don\u0026rsquo;t have enough people to do all of\nthe tasks and your technology is not able to do some of the tasks. The\nright combination and the right visibility into your defense metrics is an\napproach that we attend or we really like to include in our process of\nthinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 03:27\nWe are playing with it because in application security, the Identify, Detect,\nProtect convention of NIST sometimes challenging to adapt, to apply\ndirectly to everything that we do. So we\u0026rsquo;re always busy with it. We are\nmapping in it. We have this open project, the AbSec mapping vendors can\nsubscribe, can submit their solutions and then we list the solutions. We\ngive of information about each solution, let you also see what kind of\nvendors have and also open source tools inside. The main purpose of this\nis to help to assist everybody in the community in understanding this\nlandscape of application security. You can also kind of a tiny tool to build\nyour own map and then see what kind of things you can have for\ninfrastructure as code security, what kind of things are out there, and also\nopen source solutions and then kind of try to lay down the things that\nyou\u0026rsquo;re doing to have another perspective on this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 04:32\nIn the process of building this database of all this knowledge, Iratenzo, we\nface a lot of discussion about how things should be done, why things\nshould be done, what is the best approach, what kind of frameworks we\nhave and what is the other differences. Also about things that are more\nlike a trend or an approach that is even wider, like shift left. We get to this\ndiscussion a lot and what does it mean exactly and how to do it, is it\nDevSecOps or not, what is it like, what\u0026rsquo;s inside exactly? We are very\nconsistent in our approach to try and map a good defense metrics. So if\nwe go down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 05:18\nA little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 05:18\nBit deeper into this question, we can already start to break it down also\nfrom the threat perspective, realize the full threat and then this gives us an\nidea on what kind of assets should be under the jurisdiction of Upsec. Here\nis just a simplified, top level, stride approach to all the things that make up\nyour full application stacks, again in very high level. When you think about\ntampering related problems, so you need to consider your CI CD pipelines\nthemselves, the external supply chain, the internal supply chain, and then\nalso the instrumentation and everything that is actually operating your\napplication. All these under the risk of tampering. You as application\nsecurity function, you have to think of fortifying this threat, fortifying your\nassets from the threat of tampering across the stack. This is what makes it\nso complicated. We break it down to actual activities in the NISS security\nfunction domains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 06:18\nWe already have some more familiar names for those of us who are not\ndoing stride every morning. We already see categories of tools and how\nthey help in breaking this down. All this is something that happens every\nday in every company that exercises application security. All of a sudden\nthere is this okay, we need to shift left, we need to try and shift left the\nsame way that developers shifted left testing. So who does this? This is our\ngenerally speaking, our team. We have the leaders of the team, usually the\nmanager and their architects. They\u0026rsquo;re about building up some protection\ninto the environment and including the right processes for validation for\ntesting. That is not part of what we today most teams do as part of their\nDevSecOps gig. Not all of them, but on the other side of the architects\nthat are into the content, understand the application to its logic and to its\nbusiness logic functions and then help build up the right protection around\nit and within it and the right processes to validate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 07:32\nWe also have today a growing trend of DevSec ops and DevSec ops. We\nhave instrumentation, a lot of testing tools to cover up for a lot of the\nidentify vulnerability identification process. We get asked in all this what is\nshift left? Who is doing this out of this team? Is it something that someone\nelse do? Should the developers own it? What part of it should developer\nown? Who is the owner in general? This is what this talk is about. We are\ngoing to talk about what is it a perspective, white perspective on what\nshift left is just looking different perspective of shift left not necessarily in\nsecurity and what was the impact of it. I think we will drill down into the\ndiscussion on how does it look today in application security? We will wrap\nup with some discussion on things that maybe we should consider as first,\neasier and more impactful steps to shift left and to inspire a shift left\nmovement for security inside an organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 08:46\nSo what is it? If we think about the dev SecOps as the DevOps as a\ndelivery model or framework to think about, a way to think about how the\nsoftware factory works. The software factory works in phases where from\nthe moment something is in the ideation phase up to the level that it\u0026rsquo;s been\noperated and been kept operated and maintained in production and then\nusually it feeds back into evolution of the software start add a new feature\nor fix a problem and go all the way back until this problem is operated.\nThe infinity loop was already something that we all familiar with. Shift left\nis if you think about this loop and you spread it one long line, the left is the\nstart, that is the side that starts from the developers from the create phase\nof the story. The right handmost side is the right where things are\noperated, things are already in production, things are already materialized\ninto something that is part of our business, part of our dependency chain\nand it\u0026rsquo;s harder to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 10:02\nHere is the beginning, here is the genesis of all software. It starts from\nsomeone has an idea and then wrote some code and shift left is about\nmoving things here because then it would be easier to control the\nevolution and fix problem before they get into a place where it\u0026rsquo;s a bit\nharder to get rid of what kind of things we can shift left. If you think\nabout this as a broader term, not only security shift left security, but\nbroader term, the creatives. On the leftmost side you can\u0026rsquo;t shift it more to\nthe left because it\u0026rsquo;s already at the left testing and security testing can be in\nthe intermediate side, it can be pushed as much as possible to the left and\nthen the rest of the flow is alleviated from those tasks to a point.\nSomething that is maybe not usually conceived as a shift left activity, but\nall the effort of describing elements of your deployment in terms of the\nactual artifacts, but also the topology and the way that your production\nenvironment operates and artifacts communicate with each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 11:18\nThis effort has been greatly pushed to the left with infrastructure as code\napproaches in the last few years and had a tremendous effect. This is\ndefinitely something that can be decided, an organization can decide that\nthey expect that part of activity that is about taking a code and preparing\nit for operation in production can be pushed to the left and be done by\ndevelopers. What is the motivation? The motivation, as said before,\neverything starts from the code. Everything starts from this moment in\ntime that someone had an idea. In an enterprise environment, this idea is\ndifferent maybe than in your basement. Still it\u0026rsquo;s the same thing that you\nhave some an idea and then you build up plan and start building it. All you\nneed is a computer and an IDE and you can start code it. Every piece of\nsoftware that we\u0026rsquo;re using started from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 12:21\nThe idea of bringing more and more to this point in time is about saving\ntime. Later things get more complicated, things get more convoluted in\none another and it\u0026rsquo;s a bit more difficult to spot and fix. The actual things\nthat you shift left, things that we touched before, is that to make testing\nsomething that developers are in charge of? Kind of by the book testing is\ncore activity for developers. And they test with code. They write code to\ntest their code, which always give some a paradox kind of question, like\nwho tests the tests? This is already a standard and everybody is doing this\nand also packaging and building up the artifact, the containers and all the\ninformation for further integration and deployment is already also being\nadapted as a standard. These are the kind of things that we can shift left\nand when we dive in more, let\u0026rsquo;s try to look this in the eye and answer is it\nuseful for us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 13:43\nIf you are looking at your end of the year performance report for your\nengineering organization and or even for even larger than that, even for\nthe full company? It is I think something that many managers face is this\nquestion am I leading the right balance between investing infrastructure,\nmaking things more, investing in Velocity, making things run faster in most\ncases but still stopping and investing in some kind of an infrastructure? Or\nshould I keep just building the same way I do? Is this process right? Is it\nslowing me down? Things that part of the decision making that is inspired\nby thinking that we should shift left activity to save time later, not all of it\nis successful in the same level. If you think about containerization or any\nother type of packaging I think that it speaks for itself. When we look at\nall these public and private repositories of artifacts and amazing array of\npossibilities to orchestrate them into an operating production applications,\nI think that we can definitely say that the approach of moving part of that\njob to the hands of the developers, to the beginning of the plan has been\nvery successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 15:14\nEverybody that practices it is very happy with the results and the impact\nthat it has on their velocity. Infrastructure has got the same way. Maybe\nyou can even kind of think about it together. It\u0026rsquo;s maybe one thing with two\nfaces and then another thing that we find very successful because it is not\nnecessarily critical but it adds a lot of value and it\u0026rsquo;s not hard to\naccomplish. Attribution or the developers attribute facts or simply who\nthey are for example using code owners. This is an approach that is very\nuseful and has a lot of impact on the visibility that the organization has\ninto artifact, into the code, into what\u0026rsquo;s happening and greatly improves\nthe ability to lead a good response practices. Instead of response become\nfaster and more effective and visibility in general is improved and it\u0026rsquo;s a\ngreat supporting asset for organization that is living, breathing, actual\nproduction and needs to adapt to things that happen in real time, things\nthat are a little less successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 16:44\nI\u0026rsquo;d say maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a bit dangerous, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit risky to say because a lot of\npeople are advocating patterns like TDD and extensive use of testing. Of\ncourse this is something that is a must have for every organization that\nwants to lead a healthy engineering organization and be on top of a\nquality control. To control the quality of their outcome, but it is a large\ninvestment with varying level of impact. I say this because not all test\nflows are the same. When we talk about unit tests, sometimes it makes\nmuch more sense, but sometimes to conduct a full end to end test would be\nvery expensive in terms of investment and limited in its ability to actually\ngrasp the full potential of what can happen throughout this end to end\nscenario and give false results. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot of investment and if you haven\u0026rsquo;t\ndone it right or if your problem space is too complicated, this investment\nwould not necessarily pay off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 18:02\nI think this is why we can see in most mature organizations that already\nhave a large function in R and D, we can see also some layers of quality\nassurance processes, whether automated or manual, that are the kind of\nmitigation control for everything that was missed by the tests. The tests\nare being complemented by quality assurance manual or automated.\nWhich means that it\u0026rsquo;s a little less effective than if we compare it to\nanother activity that was shifted to the left like containerization, where\nyou don\u0026rsquo;t expect the people who were used to code the It infrastructure or\nsystem infrastructure and now called DevOps. They are not expected to\ngive attention to every new image that you publish or to every new\nTerraForm configuration that the developer is building or to a new Argo\ntemplate. Those things are built with a framework and agreement between\nengineering teams and can scale up very easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 19:10\nAll the developer needs to do is to take responsibility for the activity of\ndescribing those elements of the code, where in tests they take full\nresponsibility in building the code and sometimes even base their design\nflows with, say something like TDD on the notion of testing. The results is\nusually still need someone else\u0026rsquo;s attention to make sure that it\u0026rsquo;s proficient\nand that it\u0026rsquo;s at the point that they wanted to we move into the next type of\ntesting, which is shift left security testing. It becomes more dangerous\nbecause when a bug slips by the test and by QA and ends up to production\nand meets users and come up through the channels of bug alerts, it is clear\nthat the developer was built. It there is a gap now and this is\nmisfunctioning. Something is misfunctioning and you should get the\nattention. The case of security is not the same because there is some gap\nbetween the validity of the report and the actual defect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 20:31\nIn many cases and many of the engines that are about producing alerts\nregarding security. The part of code quality is that is related to security.\nThose engines are usually creating noise. When this noise meet the\ndevelopers, it jeopardize one of the most important things from\ncybersecurity perspective, and it\u0026rsquo;s your cooperative relationship and the\nbuy ins of developers. In other terms, in more simpler terms, if you pitch a\nproblem if you pitch a problem that is that they it\u0026rsquo;s not real and cannot be\nprioritized by developers or something that they really need to give\nattention. To, and you pitch it again and again, automatically, in large\nvolumes, you most possibly end up losing the buy in of developers and\nthem saying to you, I don\u0026rsquo;t care about this subject in general, which makes\nthis approach dangerous . You could maybe get a lot of reports, so\ncounters of things that are probably problematic with your code base or\neven with your running applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 21:48\nTo trial them and mitigate them will be more challenging to get this to a\npoint that the developers have agreed to fix the final backlog. And you\ndon\u0026rsquo;t really usually affect functionality. Many times it\u0026rsquo;s only just like a\nsynthetic gate on your way to production. When it\u0026rsquo;s too synthetic,\ncreators, makers will bypass it, will just go around it. One hand, the effort\nthat requires for triaging to truly triage and introduce only true problems\nlike usually what comes from QA feed will be real problems. This button\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t really does what it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to do, the pop up doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up.\nIn security the feedback will be there is a potential vulnerability reported\nby this tool but to say here is an exploit in many cases requires a lot of\neffort and there is not enough people to validate this and give you this\nkind of assurance, but on the other end you cannot delegate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 23:02\nShift left is actually touching specifically this point it\u0026rsquo;s also about we don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave enough system people, let\u0026rsquo;s try to scale up the way that we are\ndescribing our infrastructure, that\u0026rsquo;s one thing. We also have situation\nwhere we don\u0026rsquo;t have enough QA people or we don\u0026rsquo;t want to invest too\nmuch in QA. We want to bring more of the abilities of QA to the beginning,\nto the left. With security it\u0026rsquo;s more problematic because in many cases the\ndevelopers are not fully aware of the consequences of security defects. It\u0026rsquo;s\none of the places where it\u0026rsquo;s most apparent is in questions revolving calls.\nJust to explain calls to a person, even if this person is developing a web\nsolution that just to explain calls usually this explanation comes in the\nsetting of why did you enable Course with credentials to every domain that\nis out there? You go through an explanation of 1 hour on how course\nworks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 24:17\nFrankly, even if they are very interested, they will forget it in about a\ncouple of weeks. Two months or a couple of months. Next time might\nmake next time they might do it again. Because for them more crucial that\ntheir testing environment is working properly. And this slows them down.\nSo they just enable this goal setting. In many cases we cannot shift left a\ntriaging. There is not enough knowledge and understanding of the\nproblem. A lot of reports, the numbers surely can easily antagonize an\norganization and they cannot really prioritize this. When you cannot easily\nprioritize something you go into lengthy discussions on priorities which\ntakes a lot of your time and usually also don\u0026rsquo;t lead into something that is\nuseful. So it\u0026rsquo;s a lose situation. Just keep a discussion and this could look\nlike prove that this FCA report is exploitable. They don\u0026rsquo;t have the capacity\nto prove this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 25:31\nBut you should solve it. Because maybe even if it\u0026rsquo;s not exploitable today, it\nwill be exploitable tomorrow. Because tomorrow one of your developers\nwill invoke the function that is vulnerable in this package. The response\nfrom the engineer would be we are very busy with things that happen\ntoday. Let\u0026rsquo;s worry for tomorrow. Tomorrow. This is a very common\ndiscussion that we hear on the sidelines as we try to help the teams build\nup a good relationship and solve those problems. The bottom line is that\nthe main thing that security teams should be after the way personally I see\nit is the buying in of their partners because eventually it\u0026rsquo;s very rare that\nsecurity teams are actually applying fixes. They\u0026rsquo;re instructing and\nprescribing fixes. The people who are actually applying the fixes are the\nengineers and if we don\u0026rsquo;t have their buying we failed as security teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 26:36\nYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 26:38\nHere one of the things is also to make sure that there\u0026rsquo;s a good feedback\nloop, right, so that you can really understand what you want but also you\ncan gamify this right, so that the teams can see when they do something,\nthey can see quickly that hey, you just made a difference. Also there\u0026rsquo;s\nnothing wrong with identifying which are the teams are doing really well,\nwhich are the teams that sometimes are not as good, right? And also\nprioritize them. So you have context in there, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 27:09\nExactly. I think that this exactly leads me to my next slide when we talk\nabout the things that we should be shifting left and these things are about\npreparing and a right step in this direction would be to think of what\nwould be the first smallest step to bring this buy in. At the end of this buy\nin, when the organization is fully committed, they will shift left everything\nand they will want ID level integration and commit on checks on the\ncommits and full CI CD integration they will want and they will want to\nbuild it for themselves. As application security you cannot jump to this last\nstep of the way. You have to go through the steps. The first, easier steps is\nto focus more on attribution and more on having them play with the\nconcept of instead of enforcing the security controls directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 28:20\nStart a discussion that is visible because it is done the coders way with\nfiles in repositories that describe what needs to be done and that will start\ndescribing what the organization is going to do about application security.\nFor example. Some building blocks of this would be that you need to think\nabout that it only happens when they get the buying, when they decide it\ndoes. Because even if you get a jurisdiction to run a bunch of tools in your\nCI, if the end result, the user experience of the developers is not good\nenough, they will drop from this lane, they will bypass it and drop from it.\nIt has to come when they decide it is time. You need to focus on things that\nbenefits multiple groups. I think that one thing that shows here is for\nexample, code owners is something that has a lot of functionality across\norganization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 29:17\nYou can use it for many different things, you can use it for measuring\nperformance, but also for setting up the right channels for dispatching\nmessages when there is a problem and then also giving access to some\nartifacts if you did it right and you\u0026rsquo;re confident that you have the controls\nto manage it. It benefits a lot of interest groups inside an engineering\norganization. It\u0026rsquo;s a good example because it\u0026rsquo;s kind of simple and scalable\nin a way that everybody can benefit from it. As you do this, as you think\nabout the first thing that you should have your developers do and it is not\nautomated testing the first thing you should have developer do, you need\nto think about how you can take from that. Also and get two of the, I\u0026rsquo;d\nsay, most critical things that you need, which is the data. Ability to report,\nability to communicate things that are relevant both for developers and\nfor their managers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 30:18\nTo reflect picture that is relevant for the workflows of the developers but\nalso for the managers so they can later on increase the investment on\nthings that you\u0026rsquo;re doing. Shift left can really help you if you choose the\nright things to shift left in the beginning. Things that we can start shifting\nleft today. The Attribution is to push the adoption of patterns such as code\nowners as a security, as something that security has a stake in. Code\nowners is something that we need to give context exactly like I said before.\nEven take it, you can take it to the next level with starting to declare\nsecurity facts and also maybe information about the security lifecycle of\nthe artifact. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen teams actually been on a talk about threat model as\ncode start building threat model concepts into code. You would get the\ncontext, the visibility and also the participation of developers as the first\nlighter step before we start answering some questions that usually would\nlead to problems when it will be about the severity of this specific bug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 31:45\nYou see a team of ten people discussing the severity of a specific bug when\nyou know that the numbers in the scanners are like 10,000 times larger\nand those people are crucial and their time has been wasted. One of the\nthings that you should be focusing shift left on the first step at least would\nbe to declare your security facts to give context to the code, to where\ndevelopers are active. It can happen in the natural manifest. Some\nmanifests give you room for some code manifest gives you room to declare\nthis information. Like if we talk about the node package manager\nmanifest, there is a lot of room in there to declare it. Or you can create\nyour own file or at least you should stick to some basis that are already\nfully adapted. Like code owners it\u0026rsquo;s very known and adapt this as your\nfirst step, first tiny step in shift left and build on top of the ability to see a\nwide context your future plans, where you can say okay, the first citizens\nin the entire inventory that are going to fully onboard in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 32:55\nTesting in static code analysis testing in CI would be those ten artifacts\nbecause they said that they need more help in security in their Attribution.\nThey said this is a critical artifact. We want class A security. When you\ncome to them, they\u0026rsquo;re already ready for it because they kind of ask for it\nin the way that they attributed their information about their artifacts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:19\nJust a quick one on these code owners. This is code owners for security or\ncode owners in general, like who owns a particular bit of code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 33:26\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the first step. That would be the first step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:34\nI don\u0026rsquo;t agree. I think we should do it. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like we are helping the\nengineering process, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Because one of the things that should happen\nin engineering is who actually owns what, who owns what repository. For\nexample.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 33:50\nWe put our efforts on something that is clearly their interest. We can get a\nlot of this very important context that we need. This is why this is a very\ngood option to start with because clearly serves the needs of R and D. If\nyour organization haven\u0026rsquo;t already adapted, it helping them adapt\nsomething that is engineering. You can I think we said in the beginning\nthat good security engineering is just simply good engineering. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit\nrude to just come as an outstander and send this to the engineers directly,\nbut say, what, I need to be able to find people quicker. This code owner\nand I see that we\u0026rsquo;re not really using it. Maybe we can invest in a few more\nthings that you can do when you have code owners, when you have proper\ncode owners across the organization. And then this is an.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 34:47\nInvestment that everybody can understand. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t bring a lot of\ndiscussion on priority and will be a very good step in your whole shift left\njourney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 34:58\nYeah, cool. Actually, just one more other thing on this one. One of the\nthings that is interesting is we have some projects and I\u0026rsquo;ve done some\nreally cool stuff and actually opens some assessments around it of using\nconfig files in the repos. This would be a great place to put that, right?\nThose owners where imagine each repo had actual mapping for the git\nrepo right on who owns it, what teams are responsible, what who\nmaintains it, et cetera. Directly at the code, almost at the code level that\nwill give you that information, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 35:33\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s the code owners pattern, code owners fire pattern. Like I said,\nwe\u0026rsquo;ve seen teams that adapt it and also start to add security facts into it.\nThey put of the stride or any threat model result into those files and then\nthey can consolidate the information from those files. They put other\nsecurity facts, they put emergency slack channel information there\nrelation to business unit or to revenue stream. Information that is truly\ncritical for security teams that looks at a full picture to catch those\nimportant places and be effective in giving them the right attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:23\nYeah, absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 36:28\nAll right, I guess is there any questions in the chat or anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:35\nThat peoplec map right, that you showed, which is awesome, right? I was\nlooking at it\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool. How do you say is this open source? By the way,\nthis project, the project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 36:47\nItself is not open source but we will probably release it. We want to\nimprove code quality before but no, I\u0026rsquo;m kidding. The project itself is not\nopen source yet, but the data inside is open so everybody can submit and\neverybody who submits after just basic screening just go inside and is\nlisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:09\nYeah, because this reminds me on that I think was Tech Radar. How you\nknow that? From who created it? What I mean by tech radar. From\nThoughtWorks, right? Because it\u0026rsquo;s actually quite cool, right? Because it\nallows you to visualize right. A lot of the technologies. I think this is really\ncool, but I think if you can open source this because for example, I feel\nthat for this to be useful, I would need to create a fork of it so I can store\nthe information of the particular units. In fact, I almost would like to have\none of these just for my security team. Because we now have engineering\ncapacities, but also to have this created for multiple teams. Because if an\norganization of a distant size, this already is going to be very hard to do\nthis at organization level because every team is different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 38:16\nThe engine, you mean? Just a second. Just the engine itself that shows\nthose tired information with the search capabilities. This is what you mean\nby outsourcing or the database?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:29\nWell, when I look at something like this, I think of like a JSON file. There\nshould be a JSON file that contains all the data, right. Because this is not\nsuper complicated data right. That allows me to create the kind of maps\nthat you are showing on the other side, right, that kind of visualization.\nWe start to get a sense of what we\u0026rsquo;re using, what we\u0026rsquo;re not using, what\nare the things that we want to do, et cetera. About this is you can even do\nthreat models on top of this. You can do all sorts of things like the ones\nyou guys have, right. You want a mode where people can maintain and\ncreate their own and actually almost use this for all sorts of stuff because\nthis is quite a nice way to visualize it. This is really cool. The key would be\nto how can you even customize this or save individual versions, right, so\nthat I can share with the teams and then we can start to maintain it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:31\nI kind of view it as you want it in the case where the raw data should all\nbe stored, for example, on the GitHub repo. So you can even version\ncontrol that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 39:40\nYeah. I\u0026rsquo;d love to have a follow up session with you to discuss what can we\ndo with it, how can we align it to this idea, which I really like. In technical\nterms, it\u0026rsquo;s a react front end. The back end of the data is pulled from this\nsubmission tool, send it to a Monday form and we aggregate the data and\nwe just qualify just because sometimes people submit one line per each\ncategory and then we just qualify it and then we publish it to S three. The\nstack is very lean and very like you can see very quick. We can definitely\nthink of a way to think about it. Open Source Sound of Disabilities yeah, I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 40:29\nThink it\u0026rsquo;s cool because it also shows visually where you are. A lot of this is\nwhat I like about it is to show the maturity of the different systems and\nwhere you are within an organization or where we are within a team.\nEven the shifting left, once you got this data, you can start to visualize it,\nright? How far are you doing it, how far is actually working, et cetera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 40:51\nYeah, definitely. Like if you think about okay, so you would do is do SAS,\nthat would be your first block. Do it with open source, with mandate open\nsource and then I get of progress on Abstract testing but then I go and I\nwant to add so I will switch on this mode security WAF and I\u0026rsquo;ll get\nprogress in this and also have a generic roadmap that talks about what\nshould come before. Like code inventory is a step that you take before you\nstart the testing. Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about what kind of code we have, what kind of\nartifacts, technologies we have. So, yeah, we are doing JavaScript, of\ncourse, how could you not? You\u0026rsquo;re progressing on creating this inventory\nand altogether is your roadmap into this. I definitely get that people have\ndifferent perspective on this and the engine is quite flexible in trying\nanother thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 41:52\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s why I think you want to now foster the community, right?\nBecause only I think that the conversations that you can have from this,\nthat it only makes sense once it\u0026rsquo;s easy and scalable. Until, for example, I\nwould be able to run this in an environment that I can create even a\nprivate version of this. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to me to involve the rest of\nthe security team or even the developers, because that\u0026rsquo;s the first question\nthey\u0026rsquo;re going to ask, where is the data going to be stored? How can we\nvisualize this, et cetera. This can be expanded pretty nicely to even other\ndomains, right? It\u0026rsquo;d be really cool to start to have, for example, risk\nmaturity levels and other maturity levels that you can kind of map in the\nsame way and then even apply color coding in terms of risks, in terms of\nthings that you want to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 42:40\nBecause one of the things you touched that I really like is the idea of core\ncomponents and also the idea of when we talk about shifting and\naccelerating in the world I live in, is that the balance is almost like how do\nyou strike a balance between the speed that the business wants to operate\nand the freedom that part of the business wants to have and the security\ncontrols and the guardrails that you can put around it? So to empower\nthem. Also, how can you align that with things that you don\u0026rsquo;t want them\nto reinvent the will? The more core components you can have, the more\neffective those security things that we want to push onto the teams\nbecome. The other thing that would be really cool is to zoom into this,\nright? You can actually, even on these areas, almost like, let\u0026rsquo;s say you\ndouble click on it, right, and you could see the zoom in of that particular\narea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 43:39\nNow, in terms of this is to add right, what I\u0026rsquo;m saying, what you actually\nsee in there, right? Do you mean so basically imagine a world where, okay,\nso you got avatar, but how well are you using it and what you\u0026rsquo;re using it\nfor? Or some of the IAS, let\u0026rsquo;s say, starting about the coverage, right?\nBecause it would be cool to also color code this based on adoption, right,\nbased on all sorts of metrics that you can have on this. It\u0026rsquo;s not just the fact\nthat you have it sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s easy to buy a tool, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually being\nused. Right. Do you actually have a tool being effectively adding results,\npicking up stuff? Right. It\u0026rsquo;d be cool to also measure the health of this into\nhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 44:21\nYeah, I have another slide, but a branch in the code that actually has this.\nWhen you click this add to map, you\u0026rsquo;re being sent to another form and in\nthis form it tries to collect your perspective on how effective this solution\nis for your problem. Because then if you properly populate it with the\ninformation about the type of code that you have and then in a community\nsourcing approach of information and you can say that this sea solution is\nthe best or is adequate, at least for JavaScript. If a lot of people make this\nconnection and attribute for it, and imagine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:08\nIn a world where you then can say, okay, you can create anonymized\nversion of that, and then that\u0026rsquo;s the data that people could submit to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 45:17\nI think you should give me a call and we should have more discussion\nabout this and some ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:24\nYeah, absolutely. Cool, right? I don\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s any questions here, so I\nthink we\u0026rsquo;re good, man. No, really cool session, man. We\u0026rsquo;ll talk to someone\nand thanks for doing this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 45:35\nMy pleasure.

While it does have much merit and has influenced security in an indispensable way, I argue that “shift left” should be viewed as a tactic in a larger management strategy rather than a comprehensive solution to solve application security woes. Just as software development is a very complicated process with many layers, “shift left” should not be viewed as a straightforward, linear effort.

And we have\nLewis for the part three or Thread Modeling Qatar, which is a really\namazing concept that a lot of people should be following because it\u0026rsquo;s all\nabout practicing, trying these things and getting a lot of amazing\nmomentum. So, Lewis, over to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 00:24\nThank you very much, Dennis. So this is Louis Servin. I\u0026rsquo;m an application\nsecurity expert, have been working in this area of knowledge for a long\ntime now, over ten years, 15 years almost. Yeah, probably more 15 than\nten. I have been doing threat models for such a long time. Oh, I should\nchange the title. Sorry for that. I promise not to. Okay, wait, it\u0026rsquo;s just a title\nthat I need to change. So again, I have been in threat modeling since two\nthousand and ten s. I have been threat modeling many different systems as\na consultant, as an in house expert across different fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:12\nI worked for a long time for an automotive company, and I had the\npleasure of being the first person to create a security assessment, a threat\nmodel of factory shop floor look at automotive systems, bridge over\nknowledge for threat modeling from it into the automotive domain. But\nwe\u0026rsquo;re not discussing that. So that\u0026rsquo;s just a bit of background. What we\u0026rsquo;re\ndiscussing is threat modeling. And because the topic of this session or this\nround of the Security Summit was serverless architectures, I decided to,\nhey, let\u0026rsquo;s do a serverless architecture threat model. Why not? And as I was\npreparing this, and I had already chosen the case and I was doing\neverything, I had a very interesting conversation with Dennis yesterday on\na panel were sharing, discussing how to enhance our threat modeling\ncapabilities through something like Chat GPT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 02:14\nSo I took the bait and I decided to try to do some threat modeling on a\nserverless architecture and enhance my superpowers or my abilities. No,\nsuperpowers enhance my ability to become a superpower by using Chat\nGPT. So I hope Chat GPT doesn\u0026rsquo;t make me look like a fool. I did try a very\nsimple rudimentary prompt, but I want to have the real prompt with you.\nBut first of all, let\u0026rsquo;s discuss what we\u0026rsquo;re doing. So feel free to interject with\na comment or something. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to keep them open. Let me see, how can I\nopen the comments? Chat here. So if you have any questions, drop a\nquestion into the chat and I\u0026rsquo;ll make sure to answer as fast as I can. All\nright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 03:15\nSo threat modeling, I like Brooke Schoenfield\u0026rsquo;s definition the most, is a\ntechnique to identify attacks a system must resist and defenses that will\nbring it to a desired defensive state. So no chances. Based on business\nvalue, we defend more, we defend less. And I chose the title of Kata based\non this martial arts practice of performing a set of choreographed\nmovements. If you ever took karate, for example, katas are part of your\nexamination to move from one belt to the other. And the higher up you go\nin the rank, the more complex the movements are. And catas give you a\nway to perfect or construct this so called muscle memory. So I\u0026rsquo;m not\ninventing the term of CATA for doing technical work. Actually there\u0026rsquo;s a lot\nof previous work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 04:17\nI like to take the architectural catas from Neil Ford and I think he took\nthe concept from someone doing development catas as well. So I could say\nat least ten years of catas as a concept for It systems. So I could advise\nyou to look into that if you want to test or flex your engineering muscles.\nWas I showing the right presentation? So kata. Is this symbol from\nJapanese? It could be actually two symbols and it means form. Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s\nmove to the next one threat modeling, just in case no one knows about it\nor someone doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about it, is basically a four step process. The\nfirst one being understanding what we\u0026rsquo;re building, modeling the system,\nthe second analyzing the threats, identifying what could go wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 05:14\nAnd the most important step is actually the third one, which is mitigation\nthe requirements, the things that need to be added on top to solve the\nthreats that we identified or the vulnerabilities and threats. So one\ncommon concept that we see is difficult for many people is to differentiate\nbetween a vulnerability and a threat. And I would like to use the\nopportunity to say a vulnerability is a characteristic of the system. It\u0026rsquo;s\nperhaps a negative characteristic, but it\u0026rsquo;s something that belongs to the\nsystem. And a threat vector, an attack is something that exploits this\nvulnerability for malicious purposes. And cross site scripting is an attack\nvector, not a vulnerability. Just out of principle, it\u0026rsquo;s an attack technique.\nThe vulnerability is taking input from an untrusted source and presenting\nit to the user where it can be interpreted as code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 06:15\nAnd the fourth step, which is validating the outcome, so is the\narchitecture. Is my understanding of the model in step one correct? Are\nthe threats I identified and the vulnerabilities present and reachable? Is\nthe mitigation correct, complete or should I add more or take some? And\nfor this session I took a system from a Tweet. So someone was let me see\nif I can find the Tweet. Give me 1 second to see if I have I had it open. Let\nme see if I have the Tweet here. Yeah, I have it here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 07:01\nCan you just quickly paste that content in the chat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 07:05\nOf course I can. So I will put it in the slides as fantastic. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s there in\nthe chat. Of course. So I took from Raul Hunko this definition of a Qatar.\nSo he\u0026rsquo;s giving a Qatar for development and he\u0026rsquo;s saying OK, I need a\nsystem to manage books. And he goes on to describe it and it looks very\nsimple like that. So basically I took his definition and made a couple of\nslides just to have it more present. So what are we building? What is our\ntarget of analysis? It\u0026rsquo;s a bookshop. The bookshop will have books, we\u0026rsquo;ll\nhave customers, we\u0026rsquo;ll have orders and payments. Not too difficult. Only\nauthenticated users can make orders. A customer can have many orders,\nan order can have many order items. An order has one payment, an order\nitem is one book. Easy peasy, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 08:10\nNow, connection to the database he says use an entity framework or\nHibernate. Let\u0026rsquo;s say we use Java, we use Hibernate to connect to the\ndatabase and map code entities, code classes to tables. So we delegated\nthat and Hibernate will manage the database connections and we will\ncreate some rest endpoints. So we have getbooks to get all books\npostbooks to add a new book which is only accessible to the admin. Delete\nbooks and a book ID to delete a book by its ID and it\u0026rsquo;s the admin get\norders, get all orders. It\u0026rsquo;s something only the admin can do. Post orders is\ncreate a new order, get orders with an order ID is to retrieve a specific\norder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 09:04\nSo as a customer I can look at my order and see which books were\nincluded in the order and I can post a payment process a payment for an\norder. So that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;ve got. And now we say okay, we have an\nauthentication using JSON web tokens which means there is an identity\nprovider which will allow my customers and my administrators to log in,\nidentify themselves, gain a token to authorize themselves to make calls to\nthe backend system. He says configure serilog. I have no idea what Serilog\nis, but I will say configure log for J in Java for logging and logs need to be\nmanaged by Azure\u0026rsquo;s AWS log management service and there will be unit\ntests to test that the endpoints are working and integration tests and that\u0026rsquo;s\nabout it. I mean, we can look into the database and all that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 10:11\nSo the point here to start is and the first challenge always is where do I\nstart? So do I jump right into the details or do I want to spend some time\nlooking at the database or at the case in order? And do I have all actors\nrepresented in this solution? So what I usually do, let me stop sharing my\nscreen and share my well, I can share it here, so I have to work over there.\nSo let me share my GitHub. If you want to follow along what I will be\ndoing, you can follow on GitHub give me just 1 second to add the link\nhere, let me post it on the chat. So on GitHub LF serving OSS Threat\nModeling just lost the chat window. Where\u0026rsquo;s the chat window? There\u0026rsquo;s the\nchat window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 11:49\nSo if you go to this GitHub you will find so let me put it on the slides to\nmake sure that everyone has it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 12:02\nYeah, we\u0026rsquo;re only seeing your slide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 12:03\nYeah, you\u0026rsquo;re still seeing my slide or not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 12:07\nYeah, we only seen the slide. Let\u0026rsquo;s stop here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 12:10\nAll right, give me a second. I thought you were seeing my so let me add\none slide files. So that\u0026rsquo;s the repository where you can find the exercise\nwe\u0026rsquo;ll be doing so you can clone it. Let me share my screen then. Not just\nthe file. So share the whole screen. Share. Now I will put my Vs codes on\nthe screen. Can you see my Vs codes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 13:03\nYou can?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 13:06\nWas that a yes or a no?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 13:07\nYeah, you can. All right, perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 13:11\nYes. So I started creating a very high level diagram in which we have a\ncustomer, an API, and then let\u0026rsquo;s make the database. So I create there are\ninstructions on the repository to use this JSON file that generates these\nhandy functions I am using. So you can use it. I will create one without\nimages to simplify development. So this is my DB and this is my database.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s RDS postgresQL. And here we store and serve book and customer\ndata. So basically, what I\u0026rsquo;m using is the graph language to create graphs,\ngraphical representations of graphs. These elements you see here are\ncalled like in any graph nodes. And the links between the nodes are called\nedges. So basically what will happen is that I have also HTML.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 14:38\nI could enhance this with the images from AWS, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend\ntime finding out the image. So I\u0026rsquo;ll do them without images. Cognito this is\nmy identity provider and this is let mistake, provides pardon? I couldn\u0026rsquo;t\nhear you. Well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 15:22\nJust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 15:27\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m just trying to model so what I\u0026rsquo;m doing is I\u0026rsquo;m trying to model the\nsystem as it was described. So I\u0026rsquo;ll go back. So the first step in thread\nmodeling is understand the system. So model the system. So what we have\nis the user, right? The customer, not the user. Sorry. So I have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 15:53\nYou pushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 15:58\nI\u0026rsquo;m developing as we speak, right? So the repository I mentioned has the\nexercises from the previous iterations and has the base file to create these\nimages. And as we speak, I am updating the file. So this is not yet\ncommitted. I can commit it right away so that everyone can have it. And\nthen from there we can start working together if you want. So give me 1\nsecond to commit the code. I\u0026rsquo;ll commit it right away. Customer talks to\ncognito label equals. So this is provide username password. This goes over\nHttps and that\u0026rsquo;s it, right? So I will receive provide username and password\nso we can see that the customer is as I type, the image changes. So I have\nthe first relationship, provide username and password.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 17:10\nNow I can as a customer talk to the API and I can say label equals make\nrequests. And this is all again protected with Https and JSON web token.\nSo here we have an initial representation of the system in which we have\nthe customer talking to the API, the customer talking to Cognito to get the\nidentity. Now, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem complete, right? There is something\nmissing here. I don\u0026rsquo;t usually talk to an API, do I? So in order to be able to\ntalk to the API, I need to talk to something else that gives me the access to\nthe API, which sends me to Cognito to authenticate. So let\u0026rsquo;s say I have a\nsingle page application somewhere. Spa. No, not shape. Spa is my single\npage application. It\u0026rsquo;s react JavaScript, and this provides the UI for the\nuser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 18:52\nSo I have a single pledge application, provides a UI for the user. And\nobviously, the customer needs to talk to the spa label equals get the UI.\nAnd this is over Https, but it\u0026rsquo;s not secured with JSON web token because\nthis is basically me going to Amazon and reaching the page before\nauthentication. Right. The single page application will be the one running\non my browser, which will redirect me to Cognito to authenticate if I need\nto authenticate for buying a book. And then at some point, something has\nto talk to the database. So the API will be talking to the database, and the\nAPI will be talking to the database label equals, let\u0026rsquo;s say, get write data.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s unencrypted and admin user password. So that\u0026rsquo;s how we\u0026rsquo;re connected\nwith admin user and password.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 20:21\nI\u0026rsquo;m obviously creating a vulnerability on purpose so that we can find\nsomething easily, right? And this is a very high level view of what could go\nwrong. Now, there is something missing here. What is missing? So I can\nmake orders. How are books getting into this thing? So I need an admin\nuser, right? So now I have an admin user, or I need an admin user. So I\u0026rsquo;ll\njust copy the customer and paint it in a different color to make a\ndifference between or maybe not yet paint it in a different color. But let\u0026rsquo;s\nsay customer. Now it\u0026rsquo;s not the customer, but my admin. And now I say\nadmin. Admin is a person internal to the company bookstore admin. The\nbookstore admin has the function of updating. So let me zoom in so that\nit\u0026rsquo;s visible what I\u0026rsquo;m doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 21:47\nUpdating catalogs, or rather than updating updates. That just updates\ncatalogs, checks, orders. And what else was this person supposed to be\ndoing? So this person was also supposed to be doing adding books. So\nmanaging books, deleting books, posting and deleting books, getting\norders. Those are the three specific functions. So let\u0026rsquo;s see. Update the\nbook catalog, update book catalog, delete book and checks customer\norders. But there was something else missing, right? So what am I\nmissing? So I have get books, post books, delete books, get orders, post\norders from the customer, get orders. I\u0026rsquo;m missing the payment. Post\npayment. So I need to add a payment provider. Now, this is an\narchitectural decision that\u0026rsquo;s hard to undo. I can choose to do payment\ntransactions myself, or I can choose to use something like Stripe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 23:19\nIn my case, I could use a payment provider not to bother with credit card\ndata. So in this case, I will take a system outside of Amazon, say HTML\nout, so I make it gray to make it visible that it\u0026rsquo;s out of scope. I will not\nanalyze the gray stuff. I don\u0026rsquo;t care about the gray stuff. I care about how I\nintegrate with them, of course, but not how they do the business. It\u0026rsquo;s a\ndifferent process, vendor requirement, security, whatever, but not in scope\nfor the threat model. So I could say stripe. Stripe. Come on, stripe. It\u0026rsquo;s a\npayment provider. I could think of it as a SaaS, as a software, as a service,\nand it manages payments with credit card returns, a transaction ID. All\nright, so I have the things that I need to be able to operate now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 25:04\nI need to mix them. So I need my API to talk to Stripe and it will send\nvendor ID, send. What else will I send to it from the API so we can see the\nline gets generated automatically. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to generate it myself. API\nsends the vendor ID, what else does it do? It sends the vendor ID and the\namount. Sends a vendor ID and the amount this is an Https connection\nwith an API key. At least that\u0026rsquo;s how in my mind it works. I have no idea\nexactly how Stripe works, but I am assuming here that Stripe works this\nway. Now I have a high level context diagram. I still need to put my admin\nto talk to my API. And here I will use this label and this label will allow me\nto manifest the intention of the connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 26:43\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s say the admin updates book catalog and checks orders and this\nconnection is done over HTPs with adjacent web token as the\nauthentication method. So as you can see, the diagram grows as I type the\ndiagram, updates as I need it to update. So I don\u0026rsquo;t bother myself with\ncreating it in a visual way and moving things around for the reason that\nit\u0026rsquo;s a lot easier to have a bit of text, which I can keep in version control,\nwhich control the creation of this file, but I can diff them. I can do a lot of\nthings that make life a lot easier. So I can help readability by providing a\ntab here and making everyone basically use the same length. And it\u0026rsquo;s a bit\neasier to see the relationships here, but that\u0026rsquo;s just a basic readability\nlinting thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 28:05\nAnd the diagram is relatively simple, so there\u0026rsquo;s no need to do a lot of work\nto understand it and we capture the whole scenario. Now, what are things\nthat I could worry about? I could worry about injection, I could worry\nabout many things. Now we can also say, well, this will be hosted in AWS.\nThis will be made up of lambdas. Every API endpoint is a lambda. And I\u0026rsquo;m\nnot sure if you know Daniel Misler. So let me put on the chat the link to\nDaniel Misler\u0026rsquo;s page, 1 second. So there we have it. The other browser 1\nsecond. I\u0026rsquo;m posting it in the chat. There\u0026rsquo;s the chat. So here we have the\nlink, and for simplicity, I have summarized what he says on how to use AI,\nhow to shape or what he calls prompt engineering. So he has a seven step\nprocess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 29:44\nLet me put it over here. Come on. Thank you, so helpful. But I don\u0026rsquo;t need\nall your help. One out. So basically he says, okay, tell chat GPT who you\nare, tell the system what format it will produce, give it the task, give the\nsteps, tell it exactly how you want the output to look for, show it one to\nfive examples of ideal output and tell it what to include or not include. So I\nwas preparing this session by creating this step. So basically what we\u0026rsquo;re\nsaying is you\u0026rsquo;re an application security expert, threat modeling a system.\nYou will identify possible vulnerabilities threats in which the vulnerability\ncan be exploited and propose one or several countermeasures to avoid the\nvulnerability or prevent or detect the malicious action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 30:49\nThe output will be marked on table with the following fields ID\ncomponent, Actor, Vulnerability, Threat Scenario and countermeasures.\nThe system is hosted in AWS. The code is managed in GitHub. GitHub\nactions push the software into production. The system is a single page\napplication on the front end. The system consists of a single page\napplication which the user downloads. The single page application written\nin react interacts with the rest API calls in JSON users redirected\nauthenticated. The single page application is stored in an S three pocket.\nRequests are first landing in cloud front, then on the S three pocket we use\nCognito as the identity provider and we can do identity federation with\nGoogle, Facebook, Office and LinkedIn so that our customers can log in\nmore easily. And on the cloud side, we are fronting our API with AWS\u0026rsquo;s API\ngateway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 31:55\nHere the JSON web token will be checked and everything will be\nforwarded to a lambda. The lambda is written in Java or Dell. Lambdas\nplural are written in Java. They interact with the database using the\nHibernate framework RDS postgres instance is the database using what I\ntold you, the database admin to connect to it. We can add to that over an\nunencrypted connection. The password is configured as an environment\nvariable in the lambda function. The connection is not oh, I already had it.\nOkay, well, I can\u0026rsquo;t get it. The connection is not configured to be encrypted,\nso we can remove that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:43\nThis is a great prompt, man. You have to share it. It\u0026rsquo;s really cool.\nEspecially if we can abstract just a bit right. And just have the bit where I\nfill this bit here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 32:51\nWell, I\u0026rsquo;m following the recipe from Daniel, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:55\nI know, I know. But it\u0026rsquo;s a good practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 32:59\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see what comes out. So I just finished typing this thing. I have no\nidea what will come out of it. So I hope Chat GPT can run it. And if not,\nare you using your paid account?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:12\nAre you using four or 3.5?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 33:14\nThe free one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:16\nOkay, so then also put that on the Chat. Then I\u0026rsquo;ll run it on or push it to\nGitHub and I\u0026rsquo;ll run it on four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 33:21\nAll right, let\u0026rsquo;s see that. So I\u0026rsquo;ll commit this to GitHub as well. The\napplication has these user groups. So we have a customer which is\nexternal, an admin which is internal logging. We use log for J to produce\nlogs. Logs are captured and logs are captured and stored. Log entries are\nused for monitoring and debugging purposes. We can say they\u0026rsquo;re captured\nand stored in an S three pocket, so disconnected from a lock processing\nmechanism. So I\u0026rsquo;m introducing avalibility into the system to see if it\u0026rsquo;s cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 34:12\nBut can you see how cool it is, what you\u0026rsquo;re doing right now? You are\ndescribing the system, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 34:17\nI am. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s the same thing we already had, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 34:20\nI know, but it\u0026rsquo;s very different because in the past, remember, even the case\nwere talking yesterday, what would happen is you would spend some time\nwith the engineers, with the developers, with the architects, and you would\nhave this in your head, but you had no place to capture it or persuade.\nThere was no place that you would capture that you get a good reward\nfrom it, so you probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t capture it. Where now what you can do\nwith this is you can write this, and even if it\u0026rsquo;s going to the Dev team and\narchitects going, hey, is this correct? There\u0026rsquo;s already a lot of value in it\nbecause we already started to map the things. And then you apply the\nsecurity analysis on it, but you could also apply performance analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 34:52\nYou could also say, hey, find me usability problems, find me bottlenecks,\nfind me disaster recovery problems, find me performance. And let\u0026rsquo;s say\nfecal points of failure on the architecture from a resilience point of view.\nSo there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of interesting other questions you can ask, not just the\nsecurity ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 35:12\nAll right, sure, definitely. I agree with you. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of value here,\nright? So I\u0026rsquo;m just kind of creating my prompt. So let\u0026rsquo;s see, I have created\nthe persona, I have asked for the format, I have given task, I have given\nthe steps well, I have given the description of the system. I have told it how\nI want it. Now it tells me it wants five examples or one to five examples.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s create one example. Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s say again the output must be a\nmarkdown table and skip the preamble I don\u0026rsquo;t want it to blah, blah. Skip\nthe preamble. The ID field is a counter used to uniquely identify the fields,\nvulnerabilities and scenarios. This is an example. So that means I could\ncreate something that looks like this. I said I want ID. I want the\nvulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 36:54\nI just mentioned it here. Oh, the component actor, of course, to know\nwhere the vulnerability is present. So let\u0026rsquo;s copy that thing and put it here,\nthe ID, control V, the component actor, the vulnerability, the threat\nscenario, and the countermeasures. Now I say one, two, 3123-451-2345.\nThis is a markdown table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:34\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to provide that. He\u0026rsquo;s going to do it automatically. Don\u0026rsquo;t\nworry about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 37:37\nPardon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:38\nHe\u0026rsquo;s going to do the table automatically. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 37:41\nI know, but I\u0026rsquo;m following his recipe in which he says, give it an example of\nideal output.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:46\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 37:46\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m going to create a very good credible attack vector to have it. So I\nwould say API, insufficient sufficient authorization checks. An attacker\nabuses the lack of sufficient authorization to elevate his rights to admin\nand reduce the price of an item. Countermeasures ensure authorization\nchecks are done at the API gateway and individual function. I\u0026rsquo;m just\nquoting the ASBs by heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:02\nYeah. The other thing we could have done eventually this is we could also\nfeed it a large chunk of the mean. We could also say here\u0026rsquo;s all of the SVS\nor the SVS that is relevant to this part. Then pick the ones that, in a way,\nare relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 39:22\nAll right. So I have all of this. Now I will copy paste it into GitHub so that\nDennis can run it in parallel. So give me 1 second to put it in GitHub. So,\nDennis, here you are. So let me add the file. Explorer OSS Threat Model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:43\nYou\u0026rsquo;re going to put that on the main branch or you\u0026rsquo;re going to put.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 39:45\nIt no, on the bookstore kata. So I have not committed yet. I will commit\neverything right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:51\nOkay. Yeah. So that branch is not there. Right? So you\u0026rsquo;re going to put it\nup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 39:54\nIt\u0026rsquo;S not yet there. Yeah, exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:55\nCool. All right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 39:56\nGood stuff. Prompt markdown. Oh, God. What did it do? What didn\u0026rsquo;t it\ncopy the thing? All right, try again. Feel better. Control v okay? Not again.\nLet me see if I can tweak it somehow. Better copy paste. Okay. I have no\nidea how to copy paste it. Then I can try to put it into okay, let\u0026rsquo;s see.\nControl. C I\u0026rsquo;ll put it into chat GPT. So here\u0026rsquo;s chat GPT. I have a new\nsession on Chat GPT 3.5. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if I can put it here. There it is. So now I\ncan select it from here. Post it there. Now it worked. So that means I can\nnow commit and paste. So give me 1 second to commit and paste. Okay, I\nthink I have too many things, so give me one instant to move this to the\nother side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 41:35\nSo I will add this into the.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 41:38\nBy the way, what\u0026rsquo;s really brilliant about Louis, what you\u0026rsquo;re doing here is I\nthink you\u0026rsquo;re really capturing. I would call the essence of threat modeling\nbecause I think a lot of people go, oh, threat modeling is know, it\u0026rsquo;s\ncomplicated stuff and all. Like no, like literally, this is almost the state of\nthe art of threat modeling. Right. We\u0026rsquo;re still figuring out we\u0026rsquo;re still\nmapping the things, and then we\u0026rsquo;re connecting the dots. Right. So this is\nexactly what happens in the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 42:01\nYes. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be hard, right? It has something. Yeah, it has very few\nthings. I could have expected a lot more. It gives me a starting point.\nRight. So insecure storage and attacker gains unauthorized access to the\nS Three pockets, storing the single pitch application tampering or data\ntheft. Implement proper s. Three pocket Controls versioning. Not bad. I\nmean, easy pick. Identity provider, identity spoofing impersonate forging\nauthentication tokens or weaknesses. Enforce MFA. Not bad. Regularly\naudit and rotate secret keys. Monitor and log authentication events for\nsuspicious activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 42:55\nHey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 42:56\nFantastic. So far, so good. An attacker provides a forged or exponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 43:00\nHave you uploaded the code to your thingy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 43:03\nPardon? No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 43:07\nJust do it quickly because then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 43:08\nI was just too eager. But I\u0026rsquo;ll do it right away. I was just having so much\nfun. Give me 1 second to do it. So it add bookstore, qatar. All right, I have\nit. Kit, omit, book push, no trouble. So you could pull now if you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:13\nOkay, well, I\u0026rsquo;m going to grab it just directly from the website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 44:20\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s see. API, insufficient. JSON web token validation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:25\nOh, so you uploaded to Mania.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 44:29\nI uploaded to Mania. I just had a branch. Not a branch, but a directory for\nbookstore. I\u0026rsquo;m developing it myself so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to do a lot of\ncomplicated stuff here in the and it\u0026rsquo;s all text file, so it\u0026rsquo;s not too bad.\nNothing will break if I corrupt my own repo. Let me export the file. 1\nsecond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:55\nNo, I got it. It\u0026rsquo;s already generating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 44:58\nAll right. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if you can create a link or make a pull request to\nsee the output. So I\u0026rsquo;ll just basically I can share my screen or you can share\nyour screen. Even better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:11\nYeah. So I\u0026rsquo;ll share my screen. You got those. You got nine. All right, let me\nshare my screen. Okay, so where\u0026rsquo;s mine? Sorry, I was trying to find and\nwhat I\u0026rsquo;ll also do is I\u0026rsquo;ll show you some of the tricks. Okay? So you should\nbe able to see my screen. Chat GBT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 45:41\nYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:42\nCool. So you got application system experts. You got this, right? So API\nendpoints. So they go look. So look. Lambda database vulnerabilities,\nadmin accounts, and encrypted DB connection. Right. So these results\nbetter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 45:56\nThat one was not found by this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:57\nYeah. So you should be interested to compare both, right? Because. This\nshould be a little bit better, right. In these kind of things, four has a lot\nmore better context and understanding. So, look, use im roles for\naccessing the database. Single page application, expose the blue token.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s quite good. There you go. So we give a token look, HTP only. That\u0026rsquo;s\nquite good measures, right? Cognitive control over Google. So API,\ngateway rate limitation, the nail of service, GitHub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 46:35\nOh, you have more things because you have GitHub actions. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get\nany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:38\nYeah. Access to git repository. So there\u0026rsquo;s two ways you can tackle this. So\nI\u0026rsquo;ll show you a couple of tricks, right? Lambda, environment variables,\nAPI, endpoints logs in S three testing CI pipeline, APIs communication.\nRight. Where was that vulnerability that we put in? That was by default\nthat you put.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 46:59\nUnencrypted, unencrypted communication between the lambda and the\ndatabase. And were using admin database connection between the lambda\nand the database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:13\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 47:14\nAnd that wasn\u0026rsquo;t found. Right. So it does help you get the low hanging\nfruits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:22\nYeah. But for example, what you can do for here, so we could say, great,\ncan you focus on the connection between what was it with the two\nelements?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 47:32\nBetween the lambda and the database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:34\nBetween the lambda and the database. Right. So let\u0026rsquo;s see. There you go.\nSee? So one of the things that is really worth doing is going bit by bit. So\nnow I picked it up, right? See, lambda to RDS connection, unencrypted\nconnection there in transit could be intercepted by an attacker encryption.\nYou seeing that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 48:06\nI see it. I mean, that\u0026rsquo;s the last step in the recipe from Daniel, right? So\nthat\u0026rsquo;s why I like Daniel\u0026rsquo;s recipe so much, because it gives you a very good\nway to create a prompt and then a very good way to tweak the output.\nWhich is exactly what he\u0026rsquo;s saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:22\nRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 48:22\nTweak the output. Focus it on where you want to focus. So it gave us a\nvery good first pass with ten findings on something. But then we can start\nfocusing on the API, we can start focusing on the S three buckets on the\nlog collection or lack of log collection, et cetera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:38\nSo there\u0026rsquo;s two ways you can do this, right? You can keep improving the\nprompt here. One gotcha, which is a hack, is that remember that there\u0026rsquo;s\nstill a limitation on the prompt size. So eventually, if you keep doing this,\nyou\u0026rsquo;ll notice that the chattypt will start to lose data because the prompt\nsize is always the same. Right. So one trick that you can do is you can edit\nthis one here. See what I mean? So I\u0026rsquo;m going to edit this guy and I\u0026rsquo;m\ngoing to say so, for example, you have countermeasures. I could also go,\nlet\u0026rsquo;s say I\u0026rsquo;m going to go risk level probability, right? Actually, see, I don\u0026rsquo;t\neven need to do that, right? I could also go can you also add to the table\nabove? Risk level probability attack agent and let\u0026rsquo;s say impact, right, to\nbusiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:47\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s cool about this, right, is that now it should create a wider table,\nright? So you could see that expand the table. So increase that. See, look,\nthere you go. See what\u0026rsquo;s doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 50:06\nI know, looks nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:12\nAnd then the thing about this, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 50:14\nNo, the question here is, okay, you have a probability medium, but a high\nlevel risk to understand the likelihood of occurrence, right? Because risk is\na vector. So it works two numbers, right? An X and a Y. So we have the\nprobabilities, the Y, but we are missing the X.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:36\nWe do. But I always say that depends on the attack agent, right, or the\nattack based the attacker. Right? Because whether you have that attacker\nor not, because if you don\u0026rsquo;t have internal attackers, then the probability of\nsome of that stuff is happening is quite low, right? Like, for example, this\none, not between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 50:57\nThe Lambda and the database, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:58\nWell, between the Lambda database, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have internal attackers,\nit\u0026rsquo;s going to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 51:04\nHave here a high attacker, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 51:06\nWell, the risk is high. For example, for that one, the Lambda database. By\nthe way, I have a trick. So I created a little let me share my screen again. I\nhave a little JavaScript which I\u0026rsquo;ll share with you, right? But that basically\nallows me to do this. Can you see that? So I have a little script that just\nmakes GBT bigger because it\u0026rsquo;s really annoying that it\u0026rsquo;s quite limited,\nright? I have a little JavaScript that I can run on a page that hacks the UI,\nright, and see how nice this is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 51:49\nI know, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 51:51\nSo you can see. So in that example, you got the Lambda database, right?\nYeah. It\u0026rsquo;s high, but it\u0026rsquo;s because you have external attackers inside a threat,\nright? But then you got cognito. You got that. So I can now say, great,\nnow can you recreate the table? And this is one of the things I always find\nthat when I do thread models, I never like to mix external or internal, like\ndifferent type of attack agents, right? Basically who you\u0026rsquo;re defending\nfrom, because they will be different. And also your risk metrics should take\nthat into account. So I prefer sometimes to create the same thread model,\nbut from different points of view because everything becomes a lot more\nrealistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 52:40\nBecause if the business is going okay, so I\u0026rsquo;m really worried about attacks\nfrom the outside, then you go like this, because sometimes you might go,\nwell, the insider thread can do a whole bunch of other stuff. So this is not,\nyes, you could do this, but it probably can do even more things, or it\ndepends where you are. So I could say, look, now can you recreate the\ntable only from the point of view? Right? The table only from the point of\nview of external attackers with no to, I say low to mid level skills. Right.\nSo again, I\u0026rsquo;m not saying state actors and stuff like that. Now, it should be\nable to refocus a lot of this, what\u0026rsquo;s it called, the high, mediums and lows\nshould now be reclassified on those. Because now that\u0026rsquo;s what I would\nexpect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 53:49\nIt included new things, didn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 53:51\nYeah, well, it was out there in secured direct object references. Was that\nthere?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 53:55\nNo, I see either number three or four. Number two or three, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:01\nThere you go. From an external attacker. And we can classify this. So we\ncan also say what is our classification for this? What\u0026rsquo;s our classification\nfrom this? So that\u0026rsquo;s quite nice. Right. Because you remove actually, a\nbunch of the ones that are not immediately exposed from those skills. So\nit\u0026rsquo;s a lot more focused. S, Cloud, Front, Cognito API, Gateway API expose\nsensitive data and GitHub if it gets exposed. So this is pretty cool. Another\nthing you can do here, you could say, actually we can go back to the first\none and again we can edit. So I tend to do this quite a lot sometimes edit\nthe original prompt and you could say here, can you map in fact, this\nshould actually work. Can you see what I\u0026rsquo;m asking for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 55:04\nStride category.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 55:06\nYeah. So this is where the T from the GPT part is super critical because it\nshould now go to Stride and it should give it look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 55:19\nSee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 55:22\nHow cool is that? It understands what Stride means, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 55:30\nI know, but do you know how many times I have spent half an hours of my\nlife discussing whether something falls within this or that category of\nStride because it\u0026rsquo;s such a bad yeah, but that\u0026rsquo;s a threat category that I tend\nto skip it. But I see the value in this. I mean, I would rather map it to\nCAPEC, which is like a lot better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 55:54\nOkay. How do you spell that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 55:56\nC-A-P-E-C. CAPEC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 55:58\nC-A-P-E. Like that? Yeah. Okay. And by the way, the script that I was\ntalking about sorry, just because I got some BOOKMARKS, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to\nshare my screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 56:16\nI\u0026rsquo;m recording while you get there, we have a cool mel drews is asking any\npredictions or thoughts on how enterprises could make use of similar\ntechniques now or in the future? Considering with consideration to\nconcerns for sending organizational applications, security data to some\nAI, I think that\u0026rsquo;s part of the risk equation. Right. So having models in\nhand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 56:44\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s already addressed already. Because if you look at Open API,\nAzure Open API, and if you look, for example, at Bedrock, put this way, if\nyour organization is not using AWS, then you have bigger problems.\nRight? For example, if you\u0026rsquo;re using AWS, then AWS already has a mode\nwhere you can use Cloud Two that is locked. And if you\u0026rsquo;re using Google\nCloud, it already has Vertex that is locked. And if you\u0026rsquo;re using Azure also,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 57:12\nAnd if you have some sort of chat internal thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 57:17\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s a couple of variations, but it already completely addresses, I\nthink, Mel, that point. Right. And there\u0026rsquo;s an interesting argument here\nwhere the better we create the prompts, the better we create the\nmaterials, the less powerful model you want. In fact, if you really want to\ngo private, use Llama Two, right? And llama two is already pretty good.\nAnd again, and you can run that completely in your environment, your\ndata center, your local machine, and there\u0026rsquo;s different models of Llama. I\nhaven\u0026rsquo;t fully run it, but some guys I was talking to, it\u0026rsquo;s about between\nthree and ten grand a month. So depends on what size of the enterprise.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s already a reasonable cost and it\u0026rsquo;s going to come down. Right. Again,\ndepends on usage. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 58:01\nIf you have one person using, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a lot, but if you have a lot of\ndevelopers and if you really have those requirements not to send things\nvery widely, then that makes a big difference. So, yeah, let me just share\nmy screen to see the output here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 58:15\nCool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 58:16\nCan you see? Yeah. So there you go. Right? Is that better for you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 58:23\nSo KPEC is really the better mapping thing rather than strife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 58:28\nYeah. Now, the thing about this is that this is what the guy that was doing\nthe attack gen thing is that some of these sometimes JBT does get these\ntend to get more the IDs wrong than these mappings here. So what you\ncan do is you can feed it to it, right? So you can actually feed for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 58:44\nYou can ask it to put the link, right? Now, if it\u0026rsquo;s linked, you can just click\nand check the.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 58:51\nThat\u0026rsquo;S the one, right? Common attack pants classification, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 58:54\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 58:57\nBut the other thing you can do with this is you could also say, see, look, I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t know if you\u0026rsquo;ve seen this, so I could also take this and I can basically\ngo a new one, right? And basically I can use the advanced data analytics,\nright? And I can then say I was actually playing with this and you can\nbasically say, can you create a visualization right of this application from\na thread model point of view? So in principle, this is the one that has the\ncode, right? So basically you could see that, first of all, it\u0026rsquo;s going to create\nthe table with probably a bunch of issues. In fact, I could have probably\ngiven the other issues. Right, see, so it\u0026rsquo;s doing that, but this is the one that\nhas the advanced data analytics. Have you used this before?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 59:57\nNo, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a paid subscription. Yeah, my company is not yet on Chat\nGPT. I\u0026rsquo;m actually supposed to be doing the analysis for the risk\nassessment, but when I\u0026rsquo;m done with that, we might be able to use it. But I\nmean, right now I\u0026rsquo;m on my private account just trying things that have no\nrelationship to my company, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:00:17\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really worth doing this because this part here, it is quite impressive\nand sorry, I\u0026rsquo;m just saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:00:44\nI assume based on the description, you could also ask it to stop right\nwhere we told it to create a table and tell him or tell it to create mermaid\ndiagram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:01:00\nExactly. That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do now. So you see, look, see the risk\nlevels? Okay, so basically it\u0026rsquo;s done this bit, right? You got this thing and\nnow you can go, great. Can you create, let\u0026rsquo;s say, graph visualization of\nthis data, namely the data application should be able to now this is the one\nthat has so you can see that now he\u0026rsquo;s mapping, right? He interacts single\npage authentication handed to government success authentication. The\nuser receives a JWT token. API requests are out to the API gateway. And\nmy point with all this is that we should still have, you know, this should\nstill be verified, right? But this is the one that actually erites the code. See?\nSo he\u0026rsquo;s using Matplotlib with network X. He\u0026rsquo;s going to create a graph.\nSee, look, there\u0026rsquo;s the nodes, there\u0026rsquo;s the edges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:02:15\nCan you see user, he\u0026rsquo;s adding the edges. He\u0026rsquo;s drawing the network, getting\nsome labels to it. Access request returns. And then he\u0026rsquo;s drawing the\nnetwork. And then when he raises bugs like this and then sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s\nfunny, right? He goes, oh, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, I should be using this one. Why\ndon\u0026rsquo;t you do that in the first place? But the other thing that is sometimes\nreally cool is if you have APIs that can do this, you could also ask it for the\ncode to execute in your end or the functions to execute in your end. And\nyou could also give it code samples. But the logic is that it just gives you\nthat acceleration, right? It just gives you that extra mappings and there\nyou go, right? So there\u0026rsquo;s one visualization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:03:03\nI mean, it\u0026rsquo;s something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:03:08\nSo you can actually map it up, right? Now, the one I was playing around\nbefore is like, for example, you could also ask to do a plan to ML. So you\ncan say, hey, give me the plan to ML code for this. And in your example,\nremember that you already had some of those modules. So you can say,\nhey, here\u0026rsquo;s the building blocks that I want. Now use those building blocks\nto do it. I think once we package this a little bit more, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be\nsuper powerful. And remember that it\u0026rsquo;s also about helping, let\u0026rsquo;s say you or\nthe more expert threat model person to review the materials. Imagine you\nbeing on the receiving end of this, but also you now communicate in\nprompts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:03:48\nSo you can capture your knowledge in prompts, or are you making the\noriginal prompts better, which is that much more efficient?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:03:59\nYeah, certainly this has just so much potential, right? It\u0026rsquo;s incredible what\ncan be achieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:04:09\nActually, the other one that you can do. Let me show you. This is while you\nwere doing that. Let me see if I can load it up here. I basically asked?\nYeah, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of okay, give me a second. See if this works. You kind of\npause in the middle. But see, the other thing you can do, check this out, is\nyou can take your diagram. Look at this. So what I did is I took this one,\nsee where you were literally a screenshot of your stuff and say, can you\nwrite a thread model for this application? And you wrote this, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:05:00\nNot bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:05:01\nPhishing attacks, denel of service attacks, API vulnerabilities, this. So it\u0026rsquo;s\nnot bad, right? Maps the thing that you have there. Yeah, actually, the\nother trick that you can do, which I also think is insanely powerful, is I\nwas trying to recreate the whole thing. The other thing you can do that is\nalso crazy powerful is we could also take that table. See, look, I think this\nis really cool. So I can take this table and look, just copy this, right? So\nI\u0026rsquo;m just going to copy literally this stuff and I\u0026rsquo;m going to go, okay, I\u0026rsquo;m\nliterally just going to paste that whole thing and say, hi, can you review\nfind blind spots in the thread model below. And you can literally just paste\nit like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:06:06\nSee how I\u0026rsquo;m not even formatting it correctly, but in a way Chat DBT can\ninterpret that way better than we. So this is what I think is really\ninteresting is when you do something and you go, hey, can you find blind\nspots? Can you look at other things that we could be looking at?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:06:28\nYeah, certainly. This has a lot of potential, right. It\u0026rsquo;s basically the\nbeginning of how to do threat models enhanced by AI. Looking at this\nfrom the business perspective, I am creating a security champions\ncommunity right now. And I don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of security expertise in the\ncompany to the threat models. Brilliantly. They will get there sometime.\nBut this can just turbocharge everyone\u0026rsquo;s abilities exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:07:05\nRight. And also, I think you could also drive a little bit the whole thing of\nthinking of and teaching and getting people to use OpenAI right. And Chat\nGPT because you\u0026rsquo;re also teaching them. Because look at this. So I can\nnow can you create a business analysis to provide to a business and\nproject owner to make the business case to spend time addressing these\nissues? So now, look, create a compelling business analysis, right? And\nthere you go. Right, okay. What is actually giving me okay, so this is a\nstructure approach. This is cool. Look. So you could see introduction,\nexecutive summary, introduction, analysis, financial analysis. This is not\nbad. So it gives you the thing now. Great. So now can you write one\nadding can you write one based on the data provider? Right? So now it\nwill draft a business one. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:08:23\nSee look. So now it\u0026rsquo;s going to give you a text that you can rewrite and you\ncan basically apply. So that\u0026rsquo;s blah and the grand through landscape or\nthreat model in five vulnerabilities, right? Look, see, bam, bang. And if you\neven know better who you\u0026rsquo;re going for, you can start to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:08:44\nReally you can describe the person\u0026rsquo;s role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:08:46\nDescribe the person, right? So you can say, Great, but that is too long.\nCan you give me the same with max one paragraph? Right? Yeah. But\nnow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:09:14\nThis is the kind of feedback that you could give a human and be punched\nfor, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:09:19\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:09:20\nSomeone could have spent hours doing this and then you say, come back\nwith one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:09:24\nExactly, right, but that\u0026rsquo;s the thing. In the past, this is my point. My point is,\nin the past, this would be really hard to do, right, because we do all this\nstuff and it\u0026rsquo;s super painful to do, right, and now you can go, okay, can you\nwrite that one paragraph for somebody that has no idea what\ncybersecurity is? Right? So you can now start to trick it, right? And then\nyou could see that the language changed, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:10:03\nI agree, world of Chat GPT is fantastic, but we definitely need to check the\noutput, right? So it is going to write for you very easily or very long text.\nNow you need to check them and make sure that they actually match\nwhat you want to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:10:22\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s the point. The point is that I think where people get in touch\nwith you wrong is that they shortcutting the last step. And the point is that\nit\u0026rsquo;s not about shortcutting the last step. The last step is still there, or even\nthe intermediate steps. The point is that the recreation of the materials is\nnow super easy. And like you said, you can go from big to small to change,\nto multilanguages, to adding mix or say, oh, he\u0026rsquo;s the language that we\u0026rsquo;re\nsupposed to do. Or, by the way, this analysis, or he\u0026rsquo;s a project report or\nwhatever, you can add lots of bits of data in ways that in the past would\nmake it very expensive. Because you have to go back and rewrite and\nthink about these things. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:11:01\nSo even little tweaks, you can say, oh, don\u0026rsquo;t use language like this, don\u0026rsquo;t\nuse words like this, use words like that. And then you can rewrite it. And\nthat\u0026rsquo;s the keys. The feedback loop now of creative materials is actually a\nlot more, which is really powerful. And if you look at the CATA stuff, I\nthink it\u0026rsquo;s really worth exploring that onboarding, that practicing. I like the\nfact that we can now create even games on this. In fact, look at this,\nright? So actually, let me give a really cool example. If I start from here,\nright? So let me take it from that guy there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:11:43\nYou\u0026rsquo;re not sharing your screen, just showing something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:11:46\nSorry. So if I start from. Look at this example. I\u0026rsquo;m going to take that\nexample of where were actually capex, see where were, where we got that\nlist, right? Okay. So can you now create a game and the set of questions\nand answers to teach a new developer, right. How to do thread modeling?\nThreat with a t. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. Although you actually would pick it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:12:22\nThread modeling, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. Threat and thread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:12:25\nOkay. But it understands the context. That\u0026rsquo;s the other cool thing. There\nyou go. But it\u0026rsquo;s fine, it\u0026rsquo;s better if you spell it properly, right? But now, Silo,\ncan you create a game and set a question and answers to teach a new\ndeveloper how to do threat modeling for the app above, right? So give it a\ncool name and use emojis. I usually go with taste, or else you can go quite\noff piece, right? So call Cyberslu thread defenders to engage. Right? There\nyou go. Look at this. Okay, so what\u0026rsquo;s cool about this is you. Okay, so it\u0026rsquo;s\nactually giving the answer, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:13:09\nCan you see?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:13:10\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s cool, right? Because it already gives you this, right? So you\nhave the thing. But can you see how really cool is to do a game based on\nthat particular application that is relevant to that particular thing? See\nwhat kind of risks associated with storing data like DB nine passwords in\nenvironments like lambda. Now, this is very relevant to whoever, to the\ndeveloper that wrote this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:13:41\nSorry, I see. What would be fantastic is I\u0026rsquo;ll put the output of chat TPT 3.5\nor. On the repo. If you could also add the output that you have been\ngenerating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:13:58\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:14:00\nWe could then create a branch on the Open Security Summit to keep these\nthings. Also, this is a place to start, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:14:08\nYeah. Look at the difference. See what happens now. So look at the power,\nright? See, look, see what happened. I could have gave him this, right? So\nI could have say, hey, based on this, now run the game. So that will be the\nprompt, right? So you could see that. Now you got this. Look. Welcome to\nCybersfluid. Your first misidentified, right? Walk, comment, blah, blah.\nAnd then you can go like this. And then you type the answer and then he\u0026rsquo;s\ngoing to give me a response, right, based on correct answer, blah, blah,\nfantastic. Identified. But the other thing you can do, which is quite funny,\nright, is I can come in here, right, and I can say, can you run for me? Can\nyou provide highly sarcastic answers, for example, right? So it\u0026rsquo;s not going\nto be for everybody, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:15:05\nAnd comments to the user, to the player responses, right? So I think this is\nnot for everybody. But look, so now I\u0026rsquo;m going to say let\u0026rsquo;s step to the world\nof this, right, with a good attitude, right? So you can see it\u0026rsquo;s going to\nchange a little bit, right? Oh, a new cybersecurity on this. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if you\ncan spot a vulnerability better than it can spot the laser dot, right? So let\u0026rsquo;s\nsay I\u0026rsquo;m doing the wrong one and now he\u0026rsquo;s going to go it should provide a\nnice sort of really? That\u0026rsquo;s a cute guess effect. That was chocolate teapot.\nBut don\u0026rsquo;t worry, there\u0026rsquo;s more fun ahead. Do you know what I mean? But I\nthink that this makes a difference, right? And you can even put into\ncontext. I\u0026rsquo;ll run this from the point of view of a retailer or a finance\ninstitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:15:58\nYou know what, I\u0026rsquo;ll try this next week. I have my Cybersecurity Champions\nmeeting next week. I\u0026rsquo;ll provide an illustration of the system and I\u0026rsquo;ll let\nthem play the game. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:16:09\nSo what I\u0026rsquo;m doing with the Cyber Boardroom, right, is to try to create an\nenvironment that wraps this so that you don\u0026rsquo;t see the middle. For example,\nI\u0026rsquo;m using Chat GBT behind the scenes, but I, for example, just give you the\noptions and it will give you ABC, and then you click know, so it\u0026rsquo;s almost\nlike wrap a little UI from a board member point of view, but make it much\nmore interactive, much more kind of nicer. But the engine behind is sort of\nthis logic of Chat GPT, which is really cool, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:16:39\nIt is definitely good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:16:41\nAll right, man, this has been great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:16:45\nIt\u0026rsquo;s definitely a very different threat modeling session than I intended\nyesterday. But I think after discussing on scaling threat modeling, I really\nwanted to try a very good prompt for just flexing the prompt muscles and\nyou could see how it works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:17:08\nCan you see how a lot more effective you are when you\u0026rsquo;re finding blind\nspots versus creating from scratch? And I always felt that the problem\nwith most people doing threat modeling was the start, right? It was that,\nhow do I start? Where do I go? What\u0026rsquo;s the first? And then you go to stride,\nand it\u0026rsquo;s like guessing where even if jump. Hey, thanks, guys. Nice\ncomments there. But look, just what we\u0026rsquo;re doing here, literally, me and\nLewis, is what we do in threat model. This is what we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing for\nthe last ten years, right? Literally, we\u0026rsquo;ve been ad living figuring this out.\nEven the stuff that Louis now is already very comfortable doing. The plan\nto ML, I remember when we start using that, I was like, well, this is really\ncool. We can now visualize the threat model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:17:57\nSo I think what\u0026rsquo;s nice about our industry is still there\u0026rsquo;s still so much\nground to evolve, and practices like threat model are still very archaic if\nyou compared to what they should be. So there\u0026rsquo;s great space for\ninnovation, which is really cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:18:13\nIt is. It\u0026rsquo;s been a fun session. I know. Next open security summit. Let\u0026rsquo;s do a\ndifferent Qatar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:18:23\nOh, yeah. By then we\u0026rsquo;re going to have a bot. We\u0026rsquo;re going to have the Open\nSecurity Summit bot with us, right. Providing help and enhancing things\nlike this. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:18:33\nI mean, it took me about the same time it would have taken me to draw\nthe thing and walk through the case with creating the prompt. Right. So\nthe prompt was a lot of text and a lot of tweaking and a lot of following\nthe rules, but it\u0026rsquo;s given us a good result. So we could perhaps next time\nstart with a bath prompt, improve the prompt as we go to see how it\nimproves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:18:59\nWell, and to share it. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:19:02\nThe idea is obviously to share it in such a session and have the iterations\nthe prompts on a markdown file or something to keep it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:19:10\nYeah. And that\u0026rsquo;s one of the other bits I\u0026rsquo;m really looking at also, and\nplaying around with the boardroom bot is I\u0026rsquo;m creating three bots, right?\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ll go in detail the session, but I\u0026rsquo;m creating three bots, and each bot\nbasically contains Minerva. One is Athena, which does the board, the\nadvice. One is Odin, which actually does the backend stuff, and one is\nMinerva, who does the business stuff. So you kind of have a mix of\nmultiple bots playing together, which know when it works, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be\npretty cool. All right, man, this is good stuff. I think it\u0026rsquo;s been a pretty good\nsession. Man, this has been a really nice session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:19:46\nIt was really fun. Thank you for your interaction. I mean, it was great to\nsee how you use it. I saw your reading list for the summer and I was like,\nenvious of where you find the time to read so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:20:01\nYeah, but it\u0026rsquo;s like I was telling point the point of having those books,\nalthough I drove to Portugal so I could bring it, so my wife didn\u0026rsquo;t complain\nthat I brought a bag just for books. Right. But I felt that I had the books I\nneeded to read in the sequence that I wanted to read. And what that\nallowed me to do is allow me to go quite deep. And then one of the things I\nrealized was that the action was not in the models. The more depth I went,\nthe more I realized the history of it and where were and the innovations,\nand the more I understood how GPT worked, the more I realized that the\naction is not in the models is in the prompts, is in, maybe even be the\ntraining of it. Right. But that\u0026rsquo;s where I became quite interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:20:39\nBut I was able to almost read the book in sequence that I needed to. So I\nneeded the 30 books so I didn\u0026rsquo;t read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:20:46\nI mean, I remember your list was like ten books. So out of the ten, which\none was the best?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:20:52\nThere was a couple. I think the O\u0026rsquo;Reilly GPT transformers was really\ngood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:20:56\nAll right, so I\u0026rsquo;ll get that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:21:00\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s that one. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:21:02\nI\u0026rsquo;m using you as my chat GPT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:21:04\nYeah, you\u0026rsquo;re.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Treadwell - 01:21:06\nMy dean GPT. And I cut the ten books to one. That\u0026rsquo;s good enough for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:21:11\nOkay, cool. All right. Take care on that.

We start with a bang with Francesco. She\u0026rsquo;s going to covers us on\nbuilding Zealand application security programs. Over to you, Francesco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 00:21\nThank you very much, Denis. Some technical hiccups, but we hear we\u0026rsquo;re\nready to go. Thank you very much for everyone for coming and joining\ntoday, the presentation. We\u0026rsquo;re going to go through of intro on why we\ncreated the Vulnerability Management program and how to build resilient\napplication security, cloud security and vulnerability management\nprogram. This is a community effort that we kick off last year and has\nbeen developed over the course of the years with several industry\nmembers, vendors participating in building the Vulnerability Management\nFramework project, that is an open source project sponsored by several\nvendors, but completely vendor neutral. I\u0026rsquo;m here today to show you the\nlatest developments. It\u0026rsquo;s free for all to develop and participate and\ncontribute. We built this for a specific reason because there was no much\nguidance for how to solve issue other than when we found the issue. There\nwas a lot of guidance around secure development, lifecycle maturity\nelements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 01:27\nAfter you find the issue, what do you do with it? How do you triage? Who\ndo you involve? How do all the different little pieces that form mature\napplication security program, robulnerbility management program fit all\ntogether from detection to action and measurements and KPI, how do all\nthese elements fit together? I think with the latest evolution of the industry,\nwith risk based vulnerability management, the application security and\ncloud security coming together into a single CNAP, this was very much\nneeded and hence why we put it together. So, without further ado, let\u0026rsquo;s\ncontinue, and I hope you guys excuse me, because I\u0026rsquo;m going to use an\ninsane amount of jokes and an insane amount of memes, because\ncybersecurity and application security in particular is half enough. Let\u0026rsquo;s\nstart with a smile, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about with a smile. So let\u0026rsquo;s joke about it. On\nthe first jokes, on the traditional slide, on the presenter, this can never fail,\nthis can never miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 02:40\nMy name is Francesco Cipolone for who doesn\u0026rsquo;t know me. Frank for\nfriends. I\u0026rsquo;m the CEO and founder of Phoenix security startup here in\nLondon and Europe that revolves around software security, maturity\naggregation, prioritization, but fundamentally my mission is to prevent\nburnout and make everybody live a happy life on security. Why? My ethos\nis because I\u0026rsquo;ve been through this, I\u0026rsquo;ve been through several vulnerability\nmanagement transformation. I felt the pain of actually triaging, dealing\nwith tons of tickets, dealing with tons of frustrated developer and security\nprofessional executive that couldn\u0026rsquo;t get into the same page. I\u0026rsquo;ve been\ndoing a lot of transformation from several financial institution to telcos.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot of environment doing this. My question to you is, can we\nscale security to make it more enjoyable? A little bit more fun. Yeah, the\nanswer is yes, we can. Vulnerability management framework is the first\npart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 03:46\nSo what is a framework? Well, traditionally it has been around scanning\neverything that you can find possibly. This is definitely one part of a\nvulnerability management framework or detection of issue from software\nto vulnerabilities infrastructure, operating system and all the way down to\nthe cloud. It\u0026rsquo;s not only that, it\u0026rsquo;s what you do with these things. How do\nyou mature, how do you define who needs to what, when and to which\nlevel? This is all the purpose endpoint around the vulnerability\nmanagement level. Today, as I mentioned, we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about the\nproblem and where are we and why are we here and why is this\nframework really needed across the industry? Why it was very much\nvocalized on why it was needed, the issue and human cost of actually\ntriaging and fixing vulnerability manually that has exacerbated in the\nrecent year. I wanted to bring some data and metrics together with some\nstudies that have been available in the industry and then we\u0026rsquo;re going to\ndive deeper on the modern security development lifecycle or security\ndevelopment framework and focusing then on deep diving in the\nvulnerability management framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 05:01\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to stop a certain section for everybody to ask question and then\nwe\u0026rsquo;re going to wrap up at the end with why the Q and A. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with a\nfundamental question why do we need a vulnerability management\nframework or why do we need some guidance or why do we need\nvulnerability overall or managing those vulnerabilities? Well, let\u0026rsquo;s start\nwith the more obvious thing that everybody knows, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s useful\nto reiterate attackers are getting faster and faster with chat GPT, new\nattack methods, script keydis and new developments. Attacker are getting\nfaster at exploiting vulnerability from recent studies for critical\nvulnerability, three to 15 days from declaration time is the exploit stage at\nscale. That\u0026rsquo;s probably one of the elements that I want to hone in and\nprobably hammer during this presentation is the at scale part that has\nbeen particularly hard in the recent years because fundamentally attacker\nare getting clever and clever on orchestrating and scheduling attacks at\nscale using well known vulnerabilities that can be automated and scripted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 06:19\nThe resolution time has been dramatically squished, especially for things\nexternally facing, but also we\u0026rsquo;ve seen things that are also internally facing\nin an organization being at risk in some level of stage. This is of a diagram\nof how the history have changed from 2013 where the average resolution\ntime and exploit time, sorry, was around 80 days for a critical vulnerability\nfrom the date of discovery to all the way down to 2021 and forward where\nthe vulnerability resolution time is around 15 days. Three to 15 days\nroughly right now is the average and some statistics around average time\nthat this one of the recent Garner studies, but Kolis hasn\u0026rsquo;t released similar\nstudies. Ponemon Institute have released a similar studies on how quickly\nare we fixing on average vulnerabilities across the board and where\nshould we really focus. For me this feels like we are defending\norganization with 2013 mindset and defense, but having 2023 level\nattackers and this is only going to get worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 07:37\nI know I\u0026rsquo;m reiterating the obvious, but things are getting faster quickly if\nyou enable me the job. One input breaches has been proven to be derived\nfrom direct vulnerability exploitation of things that are externally facing.\nThe time is now to actually think in a bit more clever way. I want to maybe\nreiterate as well the fact that right now we\u0026rsquo;re focusing on really taking\nvulnerability and everything that we find from different security scanners\nand I\u0026rsquo;ve listed some of them at the bottom of the pyramid where we should\nreally focus in of a clever way to actually do that. That is contextual, that\nis CTI based exploitation, that is looking at things that really matters and\nstuff that really needs fixing. The challenge is a security professional. We\nall say we should be there and the question is how do we get there? In\norder to get to the Moon, we need a step by step approach and hence why\nwe created the vulnerability management framework to create that level\nof guidance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 08:53\nBecause not everybody needs to be around the Moon. Maybe in your\norganization, maybe you can be well off just looking at what are the\nexploits available in the one. Because even with just that you will shave off\nan enormous amount of vulnerability, at least from a software and\noperating system perspective and container perspective, it will reduce\ndrastically the amount of vulnerability that you will look at. From a\nsoftware perspective it\u0026rsquo;s roughly the same amount. If you look at\ncontextualization, roughly 10% of vulnerability are the only one that really\nneed attention. If you bring additional context and intelligence, it will be\neven less. Without intelligence, without context, without any information,\nwhere are we standing? This is the modern security development lifecycle\nafter an organization have implemented maybe one, two or three scanners\nand you try to dump information in a security data lake or you might look\nat different security dashboards, you have tons of criticals from different\nscanners, completely uncontextualized, completely unrelated together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 10:04\nThe question is where do you start, how should fix things and what is the\nmost urgent? To me, when I started this life in application, security and\nvulnerability management triaging at scale, I was overhelmed and to me it\nfelt like finding a needle in a haystack. A haystack was on fire and\neverybody was screaming around me. Scaling this to organization, to\nlarge enterprise organization was particularly challenging. How are we\nfixing it so far? What are the methods and approach that we\u0026rsquo;re fixing it so\nfar? Well, we put a security team in front of a huge backlog of\nvulnerability to triage across all the landscape that we have, plus looking\nat cyber threat, intelligence and then trying to find the vulnerability\nmatters most and being that rake that fundamentally shifted and reduced\nthe number of vulnerability to a minimal level, to the 10%. But that\u0026rsquo;s not\nscalable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 11:08\nAnd that leads to burnout. Shall I mention what happened to lawful J or\nspring for Shell or any other if you want us? One of my good friend Alyssa\nsays the superstar vulnerability that every hands on deck, everything needs\nto be resolved in every kind of repository or in any kind of library or in any\nkind of operating system, which Paulina was across the board. A very well\nknown Microsoft vulnerability log for J was the other well known one that\nhappened during Christmas last year. We all kind of remember and I guess\nhave PTSD out of log for J. Do every lock for Jenny to be resolved?\nProbably not, but we have the capability to say which one should we\nresolve? Which particular instance of lock for J is actually behind a buff,\nbehind a compensating control? Probably not. The usually narrative that\nhappens is the boats hear something on the news say do we have this\nproblem, shall we fix everything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 12:15\nAll hands on deck. The opposite element that happens is when security\nteam says security is everybody\u0026rsquo;s responsibility. What that really means\nusually is checking to development team all the vulnerability across the\nboard and that results in an enormous backlog of things that might get\noverlooked or might not get overlooked. Development team work and job\nis not to look at every vulnerability that any kind of tool speed out.\nActually probably that\u0026rsquo;s the receipt for failure. What that generally\nspeaking, end up being is us as a security team running, scanning solution\nand then checking over vulnerability to development team and screaming\nat them why can\u0026rsquo;t you be secure? The business screams at us why can\u0026rsquo;t\nyou be secure? The reason to do so is because security team in any\norganization that I\u0026rsquo;ve been dealing with, when you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, you have 15\napplication security people for a specific amount of range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 13:23\nUsually it\u0026rsquo;s very few of us in an organization and is really difficult to\ntriage be on every single vulnerability and be in every single scrum team or\ndevelopment team. Hence we give all this responsibility to the developer\nhoping that they have more time than us to actually develop. This is the\ngood road to burnout for both aspect and both element of the table. Both\nthe security team and the development team. The developer don\u0026rsquo;t want to\ndeal with tons of vulnerability, the security team doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to be in\nevery single scrum looking at every single ticket because that\u0026rsquo;s not\nscalable and average. This was last year we have 570 more developer than\na security person. An average amount I would say, of security to\ndevelopment in a small organization is one security person for every 50\ndevs. That if you take a nine hour vulnerability triage versus a 48 minutes\ntime that a security professional can dedicate to a development team to\nanalyze a vulnerability or to sit down to an architectural review or\nretrospective, there is a huge disparity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 14:43\nIt takes quite a lot of time to recognize what to do with a specific\nvulnerability in the context of where that vulnerability happens. If we take\nyou to the extreme of any large organization that we traditionally deal\nwith, the development community keeps on growing while the security\ncommunity doesn\u0026rsquo;t keep pace. We have roughly one to 201 security\nprofessional to 200 developers. The number of hours and the number of\ntimes that the development community can dedicate the security\ncommunity can dedicate to the development community is up to 10\nminutes per team per week. That means that we either ignore a bunch of\napplication and we just focus on maybe two or three that are critical and\nwe dedicate the right time, but we need to know which one are actually\ncritical and which one are the repeat that are critical. This is why I say\nthis is the right road to burnout and I\u0026rsquo;ve been there, I feel a pain, I\u0026rsquo;ve done\nthat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 15:44\nThe only solution is probably a mention and a shout out to a team of sage\nand this is Tanya. Jank has recently shared this and I really like the idea of\nsorry for the low resolution image, was a last Windows edition but shifting\neverywhere. We\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about shift left and shift right and shift left\nmean bringing security very early stage in a security development lifecycle.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going touch in a second. Shift right means fundamentally still\nlooking at vulnerability and what happened in production and there is not\neither or both of them needs to be there. Also shift up and shift down\nmeans involving the business and having the business involved with us.\nOnly in that way we can create a good collaboration across the team\nbetween product owner, between the business development and security.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re missing one person in the room or a couple of person in the room,\nthe auditor and regulators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 16:44\nUnfortunately there is a lot of regulation unfortunately there is a lot of\nregulation around vulnerability management. More coming from the\nEuropean for the new Cyber Resiliency Act and from the recent bomb and\nall the conversation of the Cyber Resiliency Act from the US. Also there\nare mandate and statement of how many women are beating how quickly\nyou should look at things. Unfortunately those are statics and static\ninformation, static declaration. They don\u0026rsquo;t look at prioritization, they\ndon\u0026rsquo;t look at maturity, they don\u0026rsquo;t look at where you are. They just ask you,\nwhere are the vulnerability, have you fixed the report? Have you done\nthese things? Without a proper vulnerability centralization system and a\nmature program around it you spend that time and effort of security or\ndevelopment running around colliding report and I\u0026rsquo;m going to make this\navailable through PDF. We\u0026rsquo;re not going to go promise across every single\nregulation that there is around vulnerability management but there are\nmore and more statements around vulnerability management that are\ncoming out and more that will come out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 17:59\nI want to make a quick postal and take a step back. What is the real\nobjective of security? Because right now we\u0026rsquo;ve been down the rabbit hole\nof oh my God, there are vulnerabilities everywhere oh my God, we don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave enough time, oh my God, we don\u0026rsquo;t have collaboration and there is\nnew regulation. This is not the purpose of the presentation, it\u0026rsquo;s not to\ncause panic but it\u0026rsquo;s really to describe the landscape where we are and our\nthinking of where we should go and what is the real objective. The real\nobjective is not to fix all the vulnerability altogether but to involve the\nbusiness to define what and where we should be at a specific point in time.\nWhere should we be from a risk perspective and risk for who knows? Me, I\nlove risk because risk enable us as a security professional and\ndevelopment to communicate with the business and having the business\ncommunicate to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 18:57\nAlso it\u0026rsquo;s really important because enable us to describe where does a\nbusiness want us to be, against whom we should defend, against which\nlevel do we want to deploy our security team and not fixing all the\nvulnerabilities? Also because fixing vulnerability, as you can see here on\nthe right, is just one of the elements of a vulnerability management\nprogram like implementing security control, influencing culture,\nimplementing things in a shift left way, implementing fundamentally\ncontrols at the very early stage like threat modeling or guardrails at the\nvery early stage. All of those things forms part of a single but united\nvulnerability management framework that enables you resilience\nvulnerability management and application security program of work that\nenables you to operate at a risk level of an organization that an\norganization fund. I wanted to reiterate vulnerability in itself are not risk\nvulnerability on an asset described by a threat that has a particular\nprobability of an exploit to happen and a particular impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 20:12\nThis is really what risk is and our objective is to reduce the risk service in\nthe attack surface of the security team and operate at the level that the\nbusiness is comfortable with. All this is done with vulnerability\nmanagement, the framework risk management patching, fixing,\nimplementing control, implementing a culture and so on. I probably spoke\n25 minutes about the vulnerability management framework without\nshowing you what is the vulnerability management framework. Drum rolls\nand let\u0026rsquo;s show so this is the current published version of the vulnerability\nmanagement framework is divided between five levels, actually six with\nlevel zero. There is a lot of debate around the team on creating a level\nzero or not. It was a good way to show that this is when you don\u0026rsquo;t do\nanything. Usually organization operates a maturity level one. The\nframework in itself is divided between detection, aggregation and\nmanagement, prioritization action and measurement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 21:20\nThose are the various pillars of the framework with a maturity level across\neach one of them. Now we\u0026rsquo;re going to go and analyze fundamentally\nwhere vulnerability come from and how normally an application security\nprogram is put together, and then come back to the vulnerability\nmanagement framework on every single vertical of this and dive deeper.\nThat you have more context around where do we start and where do we\nend, and why is the framework structure in this way? So let\u0026rsquo;s start with\nthe first part. What is a traditional or what is a modern application\nsecurity program of work? I like to represent this in this particular way\nwhere you have at the central part the three core elements of an\napplication security program of work. This can be also described as a\nvulnerability management program where you have more less security\ndesign and secure build but you have more tests and secure operate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 22:24\nIt is applicable on both way as well as cloud security where you have\nelement of design, build and test with infrastructure as a code and\ncreation of environment. On top of that there is governance and open size,\nrisk management and risk management framework, cultural change and\neducation. We\u0026rsquo;re not here to talk about all of that area. I would like to\nfocus on the central part because it\u0026rsquo;s a central part that generates\nfundamentally issue vulnerability and also enable us to mitigate. We\ngenerate vulnerability and I know this is a bit huge to digest, so I\u0026rsquo;m going\nto go slowly on this. This is how a modern security pipeline with all the\ncontrols and all the scanning technology is created. You have on top\nfundamentally automated scanning solution and at the bottom process\nand procedures that are enabling the process and enabling security\nprofessional to operate. You have a left and a right and the left is the\nconcept of shift left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 23:31\nYou build and when you test and the definition of the dotted line is when\nyou deploy in either dev test or production. Definitely speaking, what we\nrefer here is production. The left is where I\u0026rsquo;d like to say you have fast\ntriage and fast operational fast fixing. This is where you implement\nsecurity technology and security tool like code Analysis or Sea secure\nlibrary checks, where if an issue is get thrown at the developer or at you,\nas a security professional SRE, you can quickly make a decision either to\nfix it because you have something in your IDE in where you develop the\ncode that flat red and says there is an issue here or a potential issue here,\nor there is a library. When you build the code or when you commit a\nspecific segment, this is where I call fast reage now you can make a\ndecision can I fix it or is this going to cause more issue around the code or\nis this going to cause a number of incidents?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 24:43\nThis is where I call Fast reaction, fix it now or put in the backlog and then\nrevisit it at next print or retrospective. This is some quick decision that you\ncan make and then the right part is where things happen in a more\nconsistent way. When logo J happened, local J didn\u0026rsquo;t appear in a library\nwhere were writing code, but appeared everywhere. Either if the library\nwas deployed, if the particular piece of software was deployed in\nproduction, was a Java virtual machine, or image deployed in production,\nor if you take polina happen not in a development environment, but\nhappening, production happening, laptops happen everywhere, exchange\nVulnerabilities, the latest one that happened everywhere. This is where we\nneed to monitor fundamentally production and we need to monitor what\nhappened in an operational and production environment. This is a shift\nright where we look at where vulnerability happened and they\ntraditionally don\u0026rsquo;t have somebody on the keyboard at that particular point\nin time with the exception maybe of the sock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 25:49\nThis is where fundamentally you have either complex triage or complex\nimpact assessment of a vulnerability and you need to decide how to tackle\nthis backlog. This is the backlog of fundamentally vulnerability that we\nneed to tackle and decide who needs to do what where. This is the\nchallenging part of the vulnerability management triage and why a lot of\nthe time we created the framework. So what is the process of triage? As\nwe said, I like to see it in a three step process where you discover things\nfrom various scanners, either in a fast fixed way or in an operational way,\nscan it, aggregate all this finding in a central place and then triage\ndeciding which one is important. In the process of triage there is the\ncorrelation and the prioritization process where you look at which things\nshould be addressed first. Comes the fun part, finding the right team\nwhere this vulnerability needs to be addressed or the right repository, or\nthe right people, even if you\u0026rsquo;re lucky that particular application is\nmaintained by a specific set of people and then chasing and following up,\nmaybe raising an exception, maybe that\u0026rsquo;s a false positive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 27:14\nThis is the part that is enormously time consuming. Also the triage\ncorrelation and prioritization can be enormously time consuming but this\ncan be automated in a certain way. Chasing, following up, alerting\nreporting can be gamified if you develop a security champion program,\nbut it\u0026rsquo;s definitely time consuming. Also planning, following up, resolve and\nmaking sure that the vulnerability was actually resolved is the other action\npart kind of sits at the border. I would like to maybe look at also the other\nside of the world where we have to deal as a Blue Team, as a Purple Team\nwith a lot of politics, deciding what to fix, when not to fix, what time to\nallocate. On the other side you have attackers that still have their own\norganizational structure they need to discover, they need to identify a\ngood target to attack prioritizing maybe which vulnerability to attack\nfirst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 28:16\nThen do it. They don\u0026rsquo;t have to deal with who need to fix what. Yes, they\nhave right now their own development tool and they\u0026rsquo;re becoming\nespecially for ransomware software house but that\u0026rsquo;s not the operational\npeople, the one that goes in attack. They don\u0026rsquo;t have that time or that\nexpenditure of time to spend on dealing with politics. Well us as a defender\nwe have to and this is a process that tend to be linear from our resolution\ntime. We scan issues, we visualize sorry, we scan issues, we aggregate, we\nvisualize, we triage, we remediate, we resolve and we go back to the\noriginal step to rescan and verify this is the traditional process and how it\nhappens sometimes I used to think that this was linear, it\u0026rsquo;s actually not. I\nthink it more now as a funnel where on top of the funnel you have two\nkind of source of information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 29:23\nYou have everything that happened in your software and everything that\nhappened in your environment, infrastructure, container, cloud and so on.\nYou aggregate all this information in one single place on multiple places.\nYou prioritize, you deduplicate and you contextualize each of these\nprocess enable you to screen and reduce the number of vulnerability or\nthings that you should look at. That\u0026rsquo;s the purpose of the panel to then\ncreate a streamlined approach of things that needs to be fixed. That\u0026rsquo;s how\nyou operationalize and scale a traditional chaotic and slow vulnerability\nmanagement program across different parts of the organization into a\nmore sausage factory and resolution factory. This is, if you think about it,\nvulnerability are just bugs are just defect. Development team have gone\nquite good at scheduling work to address defect and bugs, maybe doing\nretrospective and then continuing resolving. The more we go forward and\nthe forward we go, the more everything is going to be engineering\nstructured and at the pace of an engineering sprint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 30:34\nIf we align Security sausage Creation Factory and issue Creation Factory\ninto the structure and process of a development team, then we\u0026rsquo;re winning\nbecause we ensure that the development team can then or the engineering\nteam can then schedule work in a consistent way and focusing always on\nwhat\u0026rsquo;s more important, but also having process and procedures to support\nthem. Now this in the easy part and airport for who is listening of\nStructuring and shadowing work. How do we report on all this? Because\nKPI is the other very important part and aspect of reporting either to the\nbusiness or to the virus team and if we choose the wrong KPI, this is how\nwe end up looking. This is how I remember looking when I was talking just\nabout vulnerability to any community that wasn\u0026rsquo;t dealing with\nvulnerability. If I was talking about a specific APD group that was\nattacking a specific vulnerability that was behind not behind a firewall or\nnot behind a WAF and hence had the probability of getting exploited of x\namount of time or board member they would just get completely lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 31:55\nWhat the heck are you talking about? And they were right. They\u0026rsquo;re dealing\nwith business unit, they\u0026rsquo;re dealing with line of business. They\u0026rsquo;re dealing\nwith country. They\u0026rsquo;re dealing with a lot of risk. Security is not in their day\nto day dealing, not at least at their detail level. Well, if I talk about risk\nposition or amount of money that an organization could lose or the\nreputational damage maybe that an organization could lose to a\ndeveloper, an engineer will say, what do I need to do in Next Sprint? I\nunderstand the impact, I understand that this is potentially bad. What is\nthe stuff that I need to do so that\u0026rsquo;s the two aspect or the two pyramid\nelements of reporting that I would like to mention that is at technology\nlevel we have specific KPI or specific objective. If you use the system of\nOKR, that matters and that are really useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 32:54\nHow many vulnerability do you have? What is the time to fix vulnerability\nmeantime to resolution or what is the mean time to open? All these\nelements really work well at this level, which is the most critical asset,\nwhich is the most critical vulnerability. The higher you go in the chain, the\nmore abstract those reports needs to be. We need to aggregate the number\nof vulnerability. Maybe we need to convert them in risk. Yes, because\nenable us to communicate with the business and create scorecards in a\nvery consistent way per application, per business unit, per organization.\nAnd they all interrelate together. The higher we go, the more abstract\nthose element becomes. The lower we go those reporting, the more detail\nthey need to become. It\u0026rsquo;s really important to keep them linked together.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t have the risk. Level to be in a spreadsheet that express risks that\nare not totally correlated to number of vulnerability that we have or the\nstate of the control that we have on a specific system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 33:58\nBecause then when we have a complete disconnect of the objective of an\norganization saying, I want to be at risk zero. An engineering community\nsays or a security community that says, if you want to be at risk, really\nzero, you need to deploy a small army or a small country budget to\nactually be at that risk. Well, if you express the number of vulnerability, the\nnumber of. Risk of each application and you enable the business to say, I\nwant to operate at this risk level. You can quantify and you can schedule\nwork in a consistent way and in a way that is aligned with their\nexpectation. That\u0026rsquo;s where you create reporting and expectation and you\nenable the business to operate at the risk level where they want in\nengineering and security to collaborate and create that triangle of\ncollaboration that is shift up, shift down, shift left and shift right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 34:51\nSo shift everywhere. All right, so back on the vulnerability management\nframework. We\u0026rsquo;re going to dive deeper on each of these sections and\ndescribe which one, which of the various vertical they are. Right now the\nvulnerability management framework is at version 1.2 and we\u0026rsquo;re already\nworking at 1.5. Enriching a lot of the detection, prioritization action and a\nfew others element that enable you to assess in an easier way and also\nscope in a more way. The detection part is specifically important for\ndealing where you find things and we kind of divided them in an evolving\nway where you have a maturity one and two, maybe the beginning of an\napplication security scanning or an infrastructure scanning or a Pen test\nscanning. That\u0026rsquo;s usually where an organization tend to start, depending if\nyou\u0026rsquo;re a more software oriented house or you are less software oriented\nhouse. Maturity three and four is where you start getting more into the\nautomation and adding additional scanners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 36:00\nMaturity four is where you have the full part of scanner that traditionally\na software house or a modern enterprise has. That is API scanning, sea\nmanual testing, Pen testing, maybe a bug bunty program and so on and so\nforth. Maturity level five is where you start automating some of this\ncontrol, putting them inside the pipeline, operationalizing scanning, it at\nscale. Again, you don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need to be a level five, you need to ask\nyour organization which level do you want to be? That enables you to plan\nstep by step every year. How do you evolve your scanning capability? The\nfollowing step is aggregation and deduplication from a lot of those\nscanners. The more scanner you have, the more noise those generate. The\nmore you need to reduce the number of noise by either consolidating all\nthese problems and really laser focusing every team that really matters\nand we\u0026rsquo;re going to cover that in action and voting on focusing every\ndevelopment team on just the vulnerability that matters more and on the\nbacklog of the vulnerability that affect them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 37:11\nWhat is the point of raising the ticket with the development team of a\nvulnerability that is sitting on an application that they can\u0026rsquo;t support that\ncreate noise, that create confusion. The more scanning you have, the more\nlikely is that a data lake that you create all the information that you\npresent to a team becomes noisy. This is the nature of it. This is where a\nlot of organizations lack because security at the lake is a new concept and\nsecurity aggregation is a new thing. Traditionally you start by aggregating\nvulnerability and maybe represent them, maybe represent the vulnerability\nby criticality. It\u0026rsquo;s this critical, how many critical do we have, how many\nvulnerability from a low medium perspective do we have? On maturity two\nand three you start enriching and aggregating things by business unit, by\nmaybe application. That\u0026rsquo;s where you start getting more into the concept\nof enrichment and helps as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 38:15\nThe next stage is the prioritization and then four and five is where you\nhave automations. Here is where fundamentally you need more heavy\nwork on deduplication and removing duplicated from every application or\nevery scanner or aggregating things together. For example, scanner that\nscans an IP address externally and scanner that scans an IP address\ninternally. Or maybe libraries are not being used or maybe different\nrepositories that are being scanned in different and multiple scanner. This\nis traditionally what happened with a lot of organizational maturity three\nor four that they may be grow by acquisition and you have different\nbusiness units and different teams that then have their own scanning\ncapability. Maybe you have an ACA tool in one organization and an ICA\ntool in another organization and that fragmentation doesn\u0026rsquo;t enable you to\noperate in a control way. That is where aggregation deduplication really\ncomes handy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 39:12\nPrioritization is the holy grail, is the most important aspect of things. The\nprioritization aspect operates on bumping up and down vulnerability\nbased on different elements. Traditional organization in maturity one and\ntwo operates around SLA or what needs to be solved, at which specific\ntime for a specific criticality, where the organization gets a bit better and\nclever as maturity Two and three, where things get better, where you start\nusing cyber threat intelligence, possibly at scale to operationalize and\nreally prioritize the vulnerability matters more. There are several\nframework like EBSS exploit, prediction scoring, that is an open source\navailable threat feed to at least look at the infrastructure. We\u0026rsquo;re working\non CWE level software vulnerability to at least prioritize the vulnerability\nthat are attacked in the world that are more likely to get exploited in the\nnext 30 days. A maturity four and five is where you start moving towards a\nmore risk based approach, a more contextualization approach, and\nbringing in really the concept of where an asset is and how business\ncritical is a specific set of assets or an application or a business service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 40:39\nThis is where you get a bit better and you start aligning fundamentally in a\nmore business way, in a more risk way, in a more modern way. Your\nvulnerability management program or your application security\nmanagement program, the action part is what you do to then scale down\nand action on the vulnerability. Traditionally this approach in maturity one\nand two is reactive react on the vulnerability that gets raised to you from\na few vulnerability perspective. On maturity two and three, you start\nreviewing a backlog because maybe you have a backlog of vulnerability\nthat you have available and you start maturity three and four, start\ntackling down the backlog in a maybe more intelligent way or more\nproactive way. Four and five is where you start getting really proactive\nand looking at insight and statistics. There are tons of open source tooling\navailable, not just Phoenix Security, but there is Open Bus and Defect\nDojo, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 41:39\nThey give you a lot of statistic and insights on what is the most common\nvulnerability that you have or what is the most common issue that you\nhave or which one is the most vulnerable asset. That\u0026rsquo;s in maturity four and\nfive where you start getting the security team more proactively operating\nand tackling at scale vulnerability. Netflix, for example, is really good at\nthis, creating paved way, removing vulnerability altogether or classes of\nvulnerability altogether. The last part but not least important is the\nmeasurement. This is probably the area that is being developed the most\nand in this particular version of the framework is least developed because\nwe\u0026rsquo;ve been debated on what are the KPI and what are the measurements\nthat make sense at every stage and every organization have different\nmetrics and prospective. This has been highly debated on what are the\nmetrics that really matters from an operational perspective versus an\napplication security perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 42:38\nWe have a consensus around, for example, the maturity one where\ntraditionally vulnerability are being raised by criticality. You move\nreporting by SLA or number of vulnerability per business unit per SLA,\nthings that are inside and outside a service level agreement. You move in\nmaturity three where you have more business concept. Remember,\nmaturity levels are also marked together, so you don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need to\nbe at specific stage. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have any concept of business context, you\ncan do SLA based on risk, you can do SLA based on specific other\nelements. The value stages of this framework are also interlinked together.\nIn maturity five, probably some of this metric will be strickled down on\ndifferent level because meantime to resolution build versus fix, that is, how\nmany user stories do you have versus how many stories you don\u0026rsquo;t have.\nThey probably are more common in maturity three and four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 43:46\nWe\u0026rsquo;re still debating on where to move these things, this particular area of\nthe framework as well, the debate is around the element that we saw\nbefore, that is who look at various metrics and reporting. Specific KPI\nneeds to be also mapped to specific persona. If you\u0026rsquo;re a business persona,\nyou probably want to look at specific APIs that are based on risk. If you\u0026rsquo;re\nnot a business persona, if you\u0026rsquo;re a technical persona or a security person\nor a developer, you probably want to look at KPI that makes sense to you,\nlike how many stories do we need to build versus how many things do we\nneed to fix and metrics like that. There is a whole debate, we just done a\nwhole debate one of a form that I love the most that is less full security\naround this specific subject to our discussion this. Without further ado, let\nme wrap up probably the conversation that is we\u0026rsquo;ve been hearing and\ntalking about shift left, shift right, shift up and shift down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 44:54\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about going to the moon without the step necessary to\nget there. I would like to recap that a mature application security program\nor a vulnerability management program or a cloud security program. For\nme, they\u0026rsquo;re interchangeable. They all deal with defects and they all deal\nwith defects. When you write code, that is in the left and when you run\nthings that is in the right and aggregating and consolidating all these\nissues in a central place so that you can triage in a bit better way, manage\nexception and create executive reports but also an engagement with the\ndevelopment team cleaning up those information. All of this is supported\nby the vulnerability management framework from detection left and right\nto measurements to action. This is what a modern observation security\nprogram works. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t seen as well, there is a blog where a couple\nof these images are taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 45:53\nThis betterupcycle.com is a fantastic resource for a lot of these additional\ninformation together with us. Wrapping up vulnerability management can\nbe daunting and at the beginning for me was overwhelming the amount of\ntasks and people that I needed to talk with. So identify where you identify\nthe issue. This is my recommendation decide the maturity level, where you\nare and where you want to be. Collaborate and sit down with team and\ndefine which team can move faster and which team can move slower. Talk\nwith the business, shift up and shift down. Get commitment from the\nbusiness and then talk with the development and security. Shift left and\nshift right for me and implement the vulnerability management program\nand framework. Give us feedback as well. Use the framework, give us\nfeedback, let us know what you think and let us know how to fix. I would\nlike to leave you with fundamental message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 46:57\nI created this and we created this framework and we created Phoenix as\nwell to prevent burnout. Don\u0026rsquo;t just be complacent and just deal with\ncriticality their vulnerability because this leads to burnout. I would like to\nmention as well that we have all of this documented in application security\nvulnerabilities management framework is available for everybody to\ndownload for free. We are making as well a collaborative project and\nintegration with Tson in the upcoming future. Shout out to us a little bit.\nThis is what we do operationally. Phoenix security does fundamentally\nvulnerability management triage prioritization enable you to communicate\nfrom a risk perspective. Close pitch parentheses, but we are partner as\nwell with OS. If you have an OS account, please. You have access to both\nthe AbSec part of it but the full platform for free. This is our commitment\nto the community as well. On the subject of metrics, we have dedicated a\nwhole book written with the community and few other leaders in\napplication security that is available to download for free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 48:15\nSLA dead and Long leave SLA and a data driven approach on application\nsecurity. So we are probably few minutes away. I\u0026rsquo;d like to thank you\neveryone for your time that you dedicate to me. I\u0026rsquo;d like to open the floor\nto questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:39\nYeah, man, this was great. It\u0026rsquo;s like a master class on application security,\nman. Sorry. Yeah, I was just checking with Adam. I think again, let\u0026rsquo;s\ncreate lots of small little nuggets of this because I think it\u0026rsquo;s a really good\none. I\u0026rsquo;m not seeing any questions here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 49:03\nDid I shock everyone questions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:06\nI think we wowed everybody. And the slides. I keep getting better, man,\nevery session. You\u0026rsquo;re making some really amazing slides that I feel like I\njust want to use them and do all my presentations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 49:20\nFeel free to use it. This is my commitment to the community. It has a\ncopyright, but feel free to use a lot of these slides of vulnerability\nmanagement framework. Some of this stuff is freely available to use. It\ncool. I\u0026rsquo;m going not no question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:43\nNo, I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. So I think we\u0026rsquo;re good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 49:45\nAll right, good stuff. Thank you everyone.

We\u0026rsquo;re going to go through of intro on why we\ncreated the Vulnerability Management program and how to build resilient\napplication security, cloud security and vulnerability management\nprogram. This is a community effort that we kick off last year and has\nbeen developed over the course of the years with several industry\nmembers, vendors participating in building the Vulnerability Management\nFramework project, that is an open source project sponsored by several\nvendors, but completely vendor neutral. I\u0026rsquo;m here today to show you the\nlatest developments. It\u0026rsquo;s free for all to develop and participate and\ncontribute. We built this for a specific reason because there was no much\nguidance for how to solve issue other than when we found the issue.

My name is Alona, and I\u0026rsquo;m the host\nfor today. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk today about AbSec threats deserve their\nown incident response plan. And our speaker for today is the head of\nresearch for security, and his name is Omar Yaran. So over to you, Omar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 00:30\nYeah, hi. So I\u0026rsquo;ve just shared my slides with you. I also want to mention\nthat in the last few months we have been acquired Enzo by SNCC. So now\nwe are part of yeah, but this relates to research that I performed at Enzo.\nSo basically I\u0026rsquo;m going to try and persuade you or convince you that one of\nthe main things that you should be doing if you\u0026rsquo;re managing a security\nteam or application security team is probably take a look at your incident\nresponse plan for the supply chain because this is basically the biggest\ngrowing attack surface currently today. And there are a lot of small things\nthat you would probably want to do today and not on the day that you\nhave an incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 01:40\nBecause a lot of the field of supply chain in open source especially, is a bit\nconfusing and a bit filled with terminology that is just recently been added,\nand it could be under stress, too much to handle, and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of\nthings that you can do to prepare for that. And part of the things that we\nencountered that drove us to this research was the fact that a lot of\ncustomers were coming to us with questions that we thought they should\nhave known their answers by themselves before. Okay, so I\u0026rsquo;m Omar, senior\nsecurity engineer at Sneak. I previously was the head of research at\nEndoseecurity. And previous to that, I was doing quite a lot of incident\nresponse and forensics in that regard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 02:45\nAnd later I had the privilege for \u003ca href=\"mailto:working@wix.com\"\u003eworking@wix.com\u003c/a\u003e and had a lot of kind\nof two sided view of attacks and what a company looks like during\nroutine. Okay, so looking at the agenda, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to go over it. I\u0026rsquo;m not\ngoing to spend so much time explaining it here. So first a bit about the\nattack vector of supply chain. So I like to go over historically a bit what\nupsec is or was in the past and what it is today. And historically, I think\nthat application security was generally the domain that used to protect a\ndeployed application, meaning that you go into every part of its\ndevelopment lifecycle from the beginning to end. This is like the secure\ndevelopment lifecycle. And then you perform operations during that time.\nAnd then there is a PT usually that is performed over the deployed\napplication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 03:58\nIt could be on a demo environment, a QA environment. And the supply\nchain in all of those kind of risks was mitigated by a static build of\nmaterials, a bomb file, which in recent years, we hear more and more\nabout it, including, like, the biden order that recently came into effect that\nspecifies specifically which specific fields and contractor needs to require\nto have a bill of material. So this was again what we did historically with\napplication security and It security was very much in the realms and\nresponsibilities of all the developer workstations for incident response like\nEDR tools and tools like that or Antiviruses and all that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 04:59\nOf course updates and also servers like server stations and servers in\ngeneral was incident Response was the It kind of realm and they were the\none that would require everything to be updated in terms of workstations\nand server. Okay, so that\u0026rsquo;s how historically it has been looked like the\nrealm of application security looks like. And then in the recent years with\nthe introduction of Agile Shift, left development, DevOps and agile\ndevelopment and all of that changes that brought a lot of productivity\ncapabilities to applications and also shifted the way application security\nkind of what was under its realm and what it needs to address these days\nkind of grew over it at times. It security. So we\u0026rsquo;re talking changes, all are\nwritten here. We will focus a lot about CI and CD pipelines, mostly the\ncontinuous integration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 06:15\nSo every time a new change is introduced it can be automatically\nintegrated and built and that means a lot of things but also generally like\na lot of application handlers for infrastructure. So a lot of the\ninfrastructure has moved into code based, right, infrastructure as code\nand in the hands of a developer basically. Okay, so now it constitutes as\npart of the application stack, we see it as part of the application stack.\nAnd so this is to create a lot of challenges for application security\ninfrastructure, incident Response because it make it a lot whole and a lot\nmore kind of ways to understand it. We used to look at logs and see what\nwas the third party doing, what was his vulnerabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 07:25\nBut now it\u0026rsquo;s a lot more than vulnerability management because there\u0026rsquo;s\nalso an attack surface that actively use open source as a vector to get into,\nto infiltrate an organization. So a bit about the software bill of material.\nSo again, this is the concept that what\u0026rsquo;s the problem. If we take our code,\nrun it through one of the tools like Cyclone DX, which is a well maintained\ntool, and it will go into all of that digestion. And in the end, we\u0026rsquo;ll have a\nfull list of all the ingredients, third party ingredients of that software, and\nthen tomorrow there will be like a log four J kind of issue. And we all be\nable to look at that file and say, okay, here we have it or we don\u0026rsquo;t have it,\nand we have it here and in this version and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 08:27\nBut apparently this doesn\u0026rsquo;t really work and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work as well as it\nshould work and a lot of organization could not easily answer that\nquestions do we have it or not. And so we set out to see what\u0026rsquo;s missing and\nwrite a bit of context. These are a few incidents and events relating to S\nBomb across a Google Trend timeline of searches. And we can see it trays\nover the last couple of years grown significantly. And I added here ESLint\nScope incident, which is the first incident that I encountered in real time,\nthat we started to think, what are we doing? How should we as a\ncompany? I was working at a company at the time as a security\napplication, security professional, and then we needed to come up with\nanswers for R D to say, are we under any threat or not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 09:46\nThis was an event that someone hijacked. Very popular package, sub\npackage, obvious Lint, which is a very popular linting for JavaScript, NPM\nbased. And then we go all the way to the log four share log four J incident\nof December 2021, where a lot of people were looking and trying to get a\nsense of what is their software billow materials look like. Okay, so here is\nan example of how an S bomb is created. This is CDX Gen, the index JS\nfile from GitHub, and this is how an S bomb is created for Python files.\nAnd we can see that the instruction for the function to create the Python\nbomb is actually looking for files that are either a folder with the name\nPoetry Lock or Requirements TXT under any folder, or some folder that is\nnamed Requirements. And there\u0026rsquo;s a file named TXT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 11:10\nSo it looks pretty simple, right? You look for Pip files, for Poetry files, and\nyou try to list all of those ingredients in the requirements. But when you\nlook at the Requirements TXT, the Requirements file format, you see that\nRequirements. TXT is usually what these files are named, although this is\nnot a requirement. So any organization could or any convention could go\nand say, I don\u0026rsquo;t use Requirements TXT, I use some other file name by\nwhatever the project name or requirements, project Name Requirements,\nenvironment Name like Requirements, QA Requirements, Prod\nRequirements, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, Stage. And then the SBOM generation would\njust kind of overlook it, oversee it. It would be in its blind spot because of\nthe way that it works. It goes over files and it can\u0026rsquo;t look over all of the\ncontent of all the files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 12:23\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a CLI tool that runs over filepath, so it has to have some kind of check\nfor file names. And this is just an example, of course. It goes over all of a\nrange of basically any other technology for supply, like open source\nregistries, you name it, obgems go some files, or any technology basically\ndoes that in some way relies on file names. So this is one thing that we see,\nand we thought, okay, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot that can be missed. And what are we\nactually looking for in an SBOM. Where we\u0026rsquo;re trying to find a descriptive\nway to describe all the open source components and all the things that\ncomprise an application in context and not missing on anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 13:29\nAnd also making it more not like a permanent kind of snapshot of an\napplication but living updated kind of always changing, always keeping\ntrack of new changes that introduce into a modern application which\nagain always has integration tests and always keeps changing rapidly\nchanging. So we wrote a bunch of stuff and we started and we checked\nwhich of those things we can get automatically or not, what can each\norganization can do by itself and kind of put in his own customization, his\nown business logic, his own uniqueness in a way into his applications, into\nthe metadata representation of an application. Jumping back to the show,\na bit of what we come up with but looking just from the attacker\nperspective, obviously I think no one would think otherwise, that this is the\nfastest growing attack surface. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of public data to harvest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 15:05\nAll of those registries are public. You can easily list all of the most\ndownloaded dependencies for each technologies. And aside from that, you\ncan also list a lot of other interesting data like which has the most\nmaintainers, which is updated frequently, which of the public git\nassociated repositories, let\u0026rsquo;s say, doesn\u0026rsquo;t validate signatures? I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of things that you can test which of the maintainers email has\nan email that is on a domain that is no longer valid and is open for\npurchasing, for registering that domain. So a lot of easily accessible public\ndata that can be used in a lot of ways and for attackers this is really good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 16:13\nAlso you can always take a large list of maintainers, try to get that list\nover, looking for combo list of username passwords and trying to see if\nyou can maybe find some maintainer that reuse this password. So there\u0026rsquo;s\nan attacker, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot that can be done and also there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of open\nsource kind of ecosystems to look for. So just the best of information that\nis publicly available is really good for attackers and also there is a great\nreturn on investment for attackers. So let\u0026rsquo;s say you have invested a lot of\ntime, but you will manage to access a fairly popular package maintainer\naccount. That means that you have the ability to get into thousands,\nhundreds, millions of workstations servers, CI, pipelines, if you were to use\nthat whenever you see right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 17:29\nAnd also you have a lot of ways to kind of hide yourself. You can always at\ntimes unpublish a package, you can always kind of change the code that is\nfetched from external URLs. You can change it as you want. So you can\nadd some package which dynamically changes its code according to, I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t know, the IP that it comes from or timing or how you see fit on the\nserver side that holds your static code. So you can maintain yourself\nunvisible, right? Non malicious until you want to. Also there are very little\nsecurity controls over public registries and malicious packages in public\nregistries. So that also gives a lot of kind of backwind to attackers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 18:40\nIt is true that today there is much more that has been done by public\npackages repositories but still it\u0026rsquo;s very lacking like from other fields that\nare more mature kind of security wise. You can see it just by recent\nincidents where a single user, NPM is a very good example because it is\nvery publicly known and used and tested and has a lot of information and\nalso I code in node from time to time. But NPM suffered basically a denial\nof service a few months back just because someone he wasn\u0026rsquo;t per se\nmalicious but he was someone who registered a lot of packages so created\nlike an overload so there was no limits and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 19:52\nAnd again we\u0026rsquo;re talking about completely anonymous user adding\nwhatever code he wants as many times he wants and causing real\norganizations to suffer downtime for their CI, not able to fix bugs. That\u0026rsquo;s\nlike very crucial things for NPM just to maintain their so that\u0026rsquo;s bad for\neveryone, right? And again, they do make some more effort. Some\nmaintainers are required to do two FA multiple factors. Ago we would\nhave never dreamed that would be like a requirement, but today it\u0026rsquo;s not\nenough. Okay? So that\u0026rsquo;s hackers going to hack and supply chain threats.\nSo again, if we look at the OS top ten risks, which is highly regarded as\nindustry standard for the risks of web security, so we can ask ourselves\nwhere do we see supply chain attacks? So we don\u0026rsquo;t really see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 21:16\nIf I\u0026rsquo;m giving as much credit as I can probably say that it relates to\nvulnerable and outdated components might be related. It also doesn\u0026rsquo;t have\nto be outdated or vulnerable. It could be malicious. This is like a different\nkind of threat. And also security logging and monitoring failures. Again,\nwhy? Because it relates to that, but it\u0026rsquo;s not the best. Okay? It relates to\nthat because we are lacking a lot of the times in CI logging for data that\nwe need like did we build this package during this time? So it relates to it,\nbut it doesn\u0026rsquo;t clearly has anything say specifically about this threat. And\nI\u0026rsquo;m positively like my prediction would be that the next and it\u0026rsquo;s pretty\nclose, right? 2025, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be every four years, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 22:19\nSo my prediction is it\u0026rsquo;s going to be probably a category by itself like\nsupply chain attack or vector or confusion attack or whatever, but it will\nbe one of those and I think it would be pretty also eye up as a risk because\nit\u0026rsquo;s happening in the wild with it. And again, just from the sheer volume of\nthis kind of vector, I think we won\u0026rsquo;t see it stopping it\u0026rsquo;s only going to grow\nthis trend of an attack vector. So just to be a bit more clear about the\nterms that we use, so there are a few different kind of different risks when\nwe\u0026rsquo;re talking about packages. So one is a malicious public package, which\nis a malicious code published on a public registry. So this was like the code\nwas born malicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 23:38\nIt never had a single other purpose other dispackage, other than being\nmalicious. Okay? And then there is a rogue public package like ESLint\nexample that I gave, which is a legitimate code that was updated with\nmalicious code, right? Maintainer takeover account, takeover of the\nGitHub account of whatever. Or someone just deciding that he\u0026rsquo;s taking his\npackage and making it malicious for whichever purpose. But that\u0026rsquo;s what I\ncall a rogue public package. Next we have dependency confusion, where\nin dependency confusion, there is a public package that takes presidents\nover a desired internal package, right? So this is the confusion. It\u0026rsquo;s RCI or\none of our pipelines is tricked into getting a malicious package that was\nadded by someone malicious as a public package.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 24:52\nAnd it will take and since it\u0026rsquo;s the same name, there are certain flows\nwhere the public package will take president over the internal package,\nwhich is meant to be taken to be integrated and built. And then there\u0026rsquo;s a\nvulnerable package. Vulnerable package like log four J in the log for shell\nCVE detected. So this is a non malicious package which was found to have\na vulnerability. Of course, the log for shell is a very extreme example\nbecause we know that it was a very high severity and it was used in the\nwild. So we know that a lot of efforts were going there. But generally\nwhen we see any of those kind of threats, we suspect any of them, we\nthink any of them happen. So in our own CI. So any one of the first three\nis an indication for a breach. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 26:06\nIf a malicious code doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if it\u0026rsquo;s born malicious, was changed to\nmalicious, or was confused to be taken over legitimate code, any one of\nthose incidents is basically a breach. You need to treat it like one. You\nneed to validate whether or not the code ran in your pipelines. But if it did,\nand you have indication for that, it means that you might need to rotate\nall of the keys and all of the assets that are related or affected, including\nthe developer station and other developers that might have ran it. But the\ndeveloper station that introduced the specific vulnerable code, vulnerable\npackage. Right. But in the case of a vulnerable package, by itself the only\nindication that some vulnerability was introduced by a package, this is by\nitself not a breach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 27:06\nYou can obviously update, you can maybe decide that in some cases you\nwant to check the log to verify that nothing was being used as part of that\nvulnerability. But this is by itself a vulnerability is not an indication for a\nbreach. And so this is very important. If you need to take one thing, it\u0026rsquo;s\nprobably some of that you cannot fix a breach by updating. You cannot\njust update a package and say okay, I fixed it. Unlike a vulnerable package\nwhere you can update and say okay, the vulnerability is no longer there. In\nthose cases, the first three you need to go and be prepared with an\nincident response because you may be breached in a very pretty sure way.\nIf any of these incident did happen, you need to treat it as a breach and\nit\u0026rsquo;s important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 28:26\nEvery breach has to have some kind of incident response. You have to\nassume maybe someone has some of the credentials that are available in\nthose environments where the code has ran and you need to validate that\nor rotate and check for any activity according to your own incident\nresponse plans. Some don\u0026rsquo;t have incident response plans and they rely on\nexternal, some organization rely on external teams so that also has\nrepercussions. So you might want to have, before you call someone, what\ndo you need to validate, what do you need to check? Maybe you can have\nenough resources to address the initial triage yourself so it might be very\nimportant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 29:27\nOkay, so if we\u0026rsquo;re looking at what at stake from an incident response view\nso let\u0026rsquo;s say you have some indication that malicious package was used\ninside your CI pipeline or inside or at a developer station was run and\nmaybe exfiltrated MRC file or credentials for the VPN, whatever you\nsuspect. So basically, you need to first try and see what the indication\nmeans, what it relies on. What are the generally, I would always suggest to\ncreate a timeline to try to understand, because a lot of the times you can\nsay. Okay? For instance, we just got a notification that some package was\ntaken during the last week has been updated with malicious code, and\nnow it\u0026rsquo;s been known and it\u0026rsquo;s off and whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 30:45\nAnd now we need to say okay, during this week have we or have we not\nbuilt this specific version into an application, into one of our applications?\nSo this might be something that you can answer or not. You need to have\nlogs, you need to know what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for and you need to maybe\nlook at what would initiate build. So build could be initiated manually and\nthey might be initiated by a new merge request or by a new, just by a\ncommit to a new branch, to any branch or just commits to a specific\nbranch. So we want to know that basis. This is the initial triage to\nunderstand whether or not there is anything to follow and then there is a\nverdict. Basically validate or accelerate to exonerate is usually harder. To\nvalidate that something is malicious, it\u0026rsquo;s usually easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 31:58\nBut to exonerate you want to be 100% sure and then after that you want\nto identify the first line of attack of assets at risk. So let\u0026rsquo;s say it\u0026rsquo;s an\napplication, then what is credentials? So it could be the CI credentials, the\nenvironment of the deployment environment. Again, where and when and\nhow it was deployed well and don\u0026rsquo;t forget the developer credentials, its\nworkstation, because today incident Response, like I said, as part of the\napplication, kind of the application extension right into a lot of realms.\nThen today the It who will check the workstation of the developer, he\nmight be able to check some of the physical forensics for the computer,\nbut it might lack in does new git commits were entered as this developer,\nwould he be able to know what he\u0026rsquo;s looking for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 33:18\nWould he know what logs he has in his git audit that is available for him\nand what is not? This is usually more in the realm of application security\nas they also a lot of the time they deal with the different development\ngroups, the different development teams and the GitHub code owner files.\nGit code owner files. It\u0026rsquo;s usually more in the domains of the application,\nrather It or something. And so all of those kind of checks should be\nperformed for the developers that are related to this incident. Mitigation\nThreat for first Line of Assets so this is what you do for the first line of\nassets in case you define them and you see which of those might need to\nrotate keys, might need to remove any changes that have been created\nautomatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 34:29\nSo, like, revert to a specific date, to a specific time, and then you keep on\nand perform digital forensics for any kind of you broaden the lines in case\nthere was movement, right? Some kind of lateral movement within the\napplication. Then that\u0026rsquo;s where you go into the less stage of trying all the\ntime to validate that everything was exonerated and clean. Okay, so again,\nif we\u0026rsquo;re looking at the challenge edge for investigative, then this is an\nexample again from npmjs. So packages can be unpublished. So if\nsomeone, for instance, if it\u0026rsquo;s something like dependency, confusion, attack\nand someone updated public code, you might be able to remove that code\nby the time you try to investigate it. So you want to know what that code\nwas doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 35:38\nUnless you have that and out of the know, the indication that something\never happened is that NPM removes a package and when it removes a\npackage, you get the security holding kind of you get a generic for that\nversion. You get a generic kind of security notice warning, but you can\u0026rsquo;t\naccess the actual code. So for investigators, for the people who do the\nincident response, they need to understand that this is part of the lifecycle.\nSo you might not have access to the particular code. So it might be harder\nto investigate. Again, there are some ways you can go at such a challenge.\nYou might be able to look at mirror repositories that might have it and\nmight not, and might have the latest version or might not. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of\nifs, but all of those you want to kind of think ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 36:48\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;ve shown previously is that most of these things and this can be\nbasically kind of automated and enlisted in the terms of what we have and\nwhat we don\u0026rsquo;t have, like identify the line of assets. This could be easy.\nUsually, you know, what an application, which databases they have access\nto and so on. You can do it prehanded or you can at least do it once or\ntwice to a drill to understand what is missing, what logs are missing. Like\nthis is an example again of something that you pretty easily can find when\nyou start to think about it as if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to investigate it and then you\nfind out that packages can be unpublished and unlisted. And so it makes\nyou think, okay, maybe I need to, whatever, put aside all the code that I\ndownload.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 37:55\nMaybe I need to have a caching mechanism. Maybe you can find your own\nanswers, I\u0026rsquo;m sure, but just thinking about premeditating, about the\nchallenges that arise, it will save a lot of time. Okay. Also a few things\nabout the nature of supply chain attacks. So a supply chain attack, it\nmight affect many organizations. Take for example, log four J, which is\nagain not an it was an attack in the sense that a known vulnerability was\nbeing used in the wild, but any other ESLint care or something that causes\na lot of organizations to kind of wonder if they\u0026rsquo;re related or not. So what\nit creates is a surge in professional needs. Right? A lot of organizations at\nthe same time, let\u0026rsquo;s say log four J calls their on call teams or calls whoever\nprofessional, would they advise it at these kind of times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 39:14\nAnd all the advisors are overwhelmed with requests because everyone is\nexperiencing the same thing. So if you rely on external professionals,\nbecause some people do in those kind of attacks, you have to have a bit of\nmore, I think, kind of plan, incident response plan because it might take a\nwhile until you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to be until you\u0026rsquo;ll be serviced by your professional.\nBut also there is a bit of comfort that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of others that are in the\nsame boat in the same situation with you because scale breaches more\ntime for each of us to kind of individually respond each organization.\nWhy? Because usually it\u0026rsquo;s not like the data that was breached, like, let\u0026rsquo;s\nsay NPM credentials, it\u0026rsquo;s not at that moment automatically being used to\nexfiltrate all the data that is available. It\u0026rsquo;s harder than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 40:48\nEach one usually can be automatically except maybe getting all the\npackages that are there. But if you want to do more, it would probably\nrequire more from the side of the attackers, which at the time are being\nbombarded with a lot of credentials. So it might work that you can have a\nbit of more time if you need to rotate keys. In that case, the more the\nmerrier for each the risk reduces because it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of people that are\nunder attack but still you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be there. And a breach can be\nhighly targeted or widely spread, right? You have a very similar results. If\nit\u0026rsquo;s very targeted or widely spread, you end up with the same result of\nsomeone might have breached this pipeline, have the credentials that are\navailable by the environment, let\u0026rsquo;s go from here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 41:58\nSo it kind of funnels everything into a very maybe similar incident\nresponse, a lot of the scenarios. Also a dedicated attack is always more\nlikely to escalate quickly because someone is targeting specifically you for\ninstance, usually because it\u0026rsquo;s name based dependency confusion attacks\nwould be more likely to be a dedicated attack. So if you think of generally\nof dependency confusion, it\u0026rsquo;s usually targeting like naming of specific\norganization or premeditated knowledge of how like if the front end code\nis exposing names of internal packages. So a dedicated attack, you can be\nquite sure that it\u0026rsquo;s more dedicated to your specific organization and then\nyou would want to escalate it quickly. And generally just a very general\nsense that a breach cannot get fixed by an update.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 43:17\nThese are like two separate things when you want to fix something and\nwhen you want to investigate and potentially have respond to a breach.\nOkay, completely two different things. Need to remember that. Okay, in\nmy last ten minutes, but I want to give some time, I\u0026rsquo;ll go over a bit of our\npredictions and what you can do like what is the takeaways and where do\nwe see this field going? So generally I said, it\u0026rsquo;s not going to stop, it\u0026rsquo;s only\ngoing to get higher, more and more, I think, being used by hackers in the\nreal world. And of course, I think we will see it, that we find more and\nmore kind of usage and targeting applications, pipelines and developers.\nWe see developers that are being more targeted than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 44:32\nPublic package managers I think will be adding security controls and we\nalready see it, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to grow and because it hurts basically\ntheir own and their own kind of brand okay, their own legitimacy is very\nwell need to be that it is maintainable that it is safe to use a public\npackage. And I think we\u0026rsquo;re also going to see more and more regulation for\nsupply chain risk management. I think we just at the start of it and the\nmore we understand that this field is complex, the more we\u0026rsquo;re going to\nunderstand that we need more and more risk management in this aspect\nokay, and where we think this might be going. So here is some research we\ndid about IDE plugins. So again. Why? IDE. Plugins because first of all,\nthey\u0026rsquo;re very common used by any developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 45:50\nThey\u0026rsquo;re open source like this code is open source. They have open also\nIntelliJ, but those are last of Ides but their reusage of extension is a\ncommon thing. You probably cannot use any of those for specific language\nwithout using some form of extensions. And then we wanted to see if we\ncan use all of the knowledge that we know about how our attackers use,\nlet\u0026rsquo;s say NPM to kind of confuse developers. Can we do the same for Vs\ncode? So basically were able to kind of create an educational package. We\nwere able to use some repository that we have no relations to, very similar\nto packet JSON confusion that was recently disclosed in NPM but over\nstarjacking types of attacks. So we could easily do that and make it\nappear like our project is very being used. It\u0026rsquo;s very lively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 47:36\nWe were also able to add the verified publisher again on whichever eligible\ndomain you can think for yourself. So generally we say like okay, this is\nwhere we\u0026rsquo;re going to meet. This is one of an example of where you could\nalso expect those kinds of attacks to be happening in the future. Bringing\nit a bit together. So I think that Upsec IR plan is really critical because it\u0026rsquo;s\nthe biggest going attack surface. It\u0026rsquo;s a huge return on investment and it\nhas very unique kind of characteristics like that when it happens, you\nmight not have proper resources available for you because it will happen\nto a lot of people, to a lot of companies. And also it\u0026rsquo;s a bit confusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 48:50\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not our original realm where we just look at a deployed application or\nin process of building an application and saying okay, what we need to fix,\nit\u0026rsquo;s something a bit different. And also there are always new tools to allow\norganization better to handling this threat. But when it comes to incident\nresponse, there are still a lot of gaps and you might want to create and\ndifferentiate some of the different threats. So this is an example of what a\nbasic incident response plan can look like. I think you should kind of drill\nand think of any uniqueness in your organization that would require\nsomething and then go over it and see do I have CI logs in SBOM to even\nstart answering a question like is a specific malicious was built or not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 50:03\nAlso the question of failing tests, for instance, in a dependency confusion.\nWell, it\u0026rsquo;s likely that a public package does not know the logic of the\ninternal package test will fail. And in that case a failing test is not an\nindication for that everything is okay because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t rent to completion\nthe bill. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a way to indicate that something was wrong and bad\ncode was maybe ran and caused this entire application to fail a test. But in\nthe process it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you\u0026rsquo;re safe so you need to take those into\naccount. So again, an example, identify the assets. Need to see if you are\nlacking there in any way to identify assets that relates to some package,\nwhat it does, what\u0026rsquo;s its usage in the code. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s being built but run\nwithout script so it\u0026rsquo;s safe, maybe not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 51:26\nSo all of that information, including, like, notify RND and so on, a lot of\nthe time we see that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen that the kind of security goes back and forth\nwith RND and asking RND questions that\u0026rsquo;s not supposed to be. Like, the\nsecurity in those kind of situations probably knows a bit more of the\nspecific risk and it should create value and not run after RND. Okay. And\nthat\u0026rsquo;s, I think basically it just know that it was based on two different\narticles that I published. So if you want to read more and how and more\nabout the resource that we did. And I\u0026rsquo;m going to have two more minutes.\nIf anyone has any questions would be love to hear it. Okay. So if you still\nmight want to ask something, I\u0026rsquo;m available online on LinkedIn or\nwhatever. I\u0026rsquo;m sure you can reach him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmer Yaron - 52:53\nSo thank you everyone. The driver behind the sneak, so I will answer. So\nwhat we did in Enzo and our unique kind of way of thinking was later\nadopted by a lot of leading vendors. And we talked about ASPM\napplication security, posture management, meaning we don\u0026rsquo;t care about\nvulnerability management, but rather the context of what is relevant and\nwhat is not relevant and what will bring the most security, which operation\nwould bring most security. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s what Sneak kind of was\nlooking in their own product to enrich it. They do a lot of good assessment\nof vulnerabilities, but they were lacking the bigger context and that\u0026rsquo;s how\nthey\u0026rsquo;re looking at it now. Like vulnerabilities is just one piece of the\npuzzle. Other questions? Okay, so with that, thanks everyone and hope to\nsee you on other sessions.

Is this reasonable and the most effective use of our users time? If AI is so smart why are we wasting users time, when there is evidence suggests that users don\u0026rsquo;t have time to be so watchful and careful? Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we stop stressing out our users?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"transcript\"\u003eTranscript:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 00:00\nYou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 00:02\nHi, welcome to this Open Security Summit session in June 2023. And here\nwe have Sarb doing another session. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like a series now where\nhe\u0026rsquo;s looking at a lot of the user interactions. And I think this one is going\nto take an interesting twist of that on AI, where some of our users are\nactually smarter than it, and let\u0026rsquo;s see how we can adopt the new\ntechnologies to actually make something work that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t working as\nwell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 00:25\nSo Sarb over to you. Thank you very much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 00:28\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s an honor as always to be on these. Thanks for having me on. Just\na quick starting point to let people know this session is less about AI and\nmore about users and more about how users behave and how they don\u0026rsquo;t\nbehave. And I use myself as a typical example of a typical user. And you\u0026rsquo;ll\nsee that as we go through. So let\u0026rsquo;s get started then. Okay, so gender, first\nof all, am I smart in AI? Then after, I\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at thinking fast,\nthinking slow, the NCSE data breach statistics. What is the number one\nproblem or issue that they talk about? What wasn\u0026rsquo;t in the statistics? What\nif AI had been used in those circumstances? And sort of advice we\u0026rsquo;ve been\ngiving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 01:23\nOur users and the cost of training and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 01:27\nAnd then going back to that question, is AI smarter than our users? So,\nfirst of all, am I smarter than AI and how smart is AI? The main graphic\nthere in that sort of montage is effectively the city and the head in the\ncenter, because basically our views of AI were based on movies and what\nAI could and could not do. And it was computers that would be connected\nto everything and they\u0026rsquo;d be able to do things really fast. And then more\nlater movies, we\u0026rsquo;ve got things like the image on the left hand side, like a\nrobotic. And then maybe you may be thinking we\u0026rsquo;re in our infancy, and\nthat image on the top right is maybe AI in its infancy. But the reality is, if\nwe look at AI, we are probably, if we look at evolution more like the\nspider, the acronym. And really that is where I think we probably are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 02:27\nIt is very early days, and if you were lucky enough to attend the sessions\nthat were run earlier on AI by Dennis, that would be a very good one on\nsome of the early things that he\u0026rsquo;s seen, how they\u0026rsquo;ve changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 02:45\nAnd I think the changes are going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 02:46\nTo come very quickly. So that\u0026rsquo;s really those things that AI can do. And our\nimpressions of AI. If I move to next slide, you see I\u0026rsquo;m probably not smarter\nthan AI. I do not have the capability to store all the sorts of books that are\nin the library. I do not have the capability to analyze lots and lots of\ninformation all in one go. I have not got the capability to be able to do\ncomplex mechanics and engineering calculations and certainly don\u0026rsquo;t have\nthe sort of wider capabilities of being able to see and analyze lots and lots\nof different images from all over the place. And although I may not have\nthose, I do consider myself as sort of smarter than a standard user. I\u0026rsquo;m not\na standard user. I am an advanced use of Microsoft. I do use Microsoft\nOffice in lots of different ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 03:46\nI do touch type, I do lots and lots of things which standard users do not\ndo. So I am slightly smarter than an ordinary standard user. But just\nbecause I\u0026rsquo;m sort of slightly smarter than a standard user, all that has been\nexperience, all that has been things that I\u0026rsquo;ve gained along the years and\nthat\u0026rsquo;s all assuming in the same way it\u0026rsquo;s experienced my experience and\nwhat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 04:11\nI\u0026rsquo;ve learned over a period of time. Effectively I\u0026rsquo;ve learned it because things\nstay the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 04:18\nIn some respects. What I would say is what if everything didn\u0026rsquo;t stay the\nsame?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 04:24\nWhat if things changed and they changed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 04:27\nRickly? Would we still be happy like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 04:30\nSecond ball or balloon? Or would we be more like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 04:35\nGirl pretty disappointed and upset that things are not what we expected\nfrom them and they are changing and they\u0026rsquo;re changing regularly. Well\nwe\u0026rsquo;re going to be that upset, angry, depressed. And how is that going to\naffect us? And are we likely to move into that if things change and they\u0026rsquo;re\nchanging ways that we\u0026rsquo;re not expecting them to change? What are we\ngoing to be more like? Well I don\u0026rsquo;t use that cuts off language but are we\ngoing to be more like that? And if we are tech savvy are we going to be\nmore like that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 05:05\nAnd the thing is, in terms of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 05:08\nHow we do things and what we.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 05:10\nChange and what we don\u0026rsquo;t change, what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 05:12\nI like to look at and how we\u0026rsquo;re used to in terms of interacting with our\nsurroundings I\u0026rsquo;ve done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 05:19\nA lot of work, probably in the.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 05:22\nLast year and a half, two years around user interfaces and looking at\nwhat makes and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a good user experience. Through that\nI came across lots of user experience, designers and sort of things that\nthey take into consideration. They\u0026rsquo;re taking consideration the way we\nthink, the way we behave, how people take lazy options. What sort of\nwords, phrases help people complete whatever they\u0026rsquo;re trying to complete?\nWhat colors work, which ones don\u0026rsquo;t work. How to make things appear\nfamiliar. Where in the screen and the place should things be to make it\nappear far more familiar? And how can they make things consistent for\nus? So user design sort of experts, they actually really look at all of these\nsorts of things. Now if we didn\u0026rsquo;t have those user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 06:09\nDesigns, designers looking at these things, some.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 06:13\nOf the things that we take for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 06:14\nGranted wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 06:17\nAnd there are certain ways that we\u0026rsquo;ve come to expect in terms of the\ninterfaces that we use. Whether you use Windows platform, Apple\nplatform, you\u0026rsquo;re talking about your mobile platforms, all of them have\ncertain standards that they use and then they use them in certain way. And\nthat enables us to learn and do what we try to do. And that ables us to\ntake advantage of some of the things that we try to do. This is some of the\nresearch that goes back to many years. And there\u0026rsquo;s a book a couple of\nyears back now, I think 2008 by Daniel Kahnman, which looked at fast\nthinking, slow thinking, and really we sort of class lots of different types of\nthinking into the two. I\u0026rsquo;ll start with the right hand side, the slow thinking.\nSlow thinking is very rarely done. It\u0026rsquo;s hard, it\u0026rsquo;s deliberate, it\u0026rsquo;s rational,\nand it is reliable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 07:08\nAnd that slow thinking. The best example I can give you off the top of my\nhead is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 07:12\nWhen you learn to drive, and you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 07:14\nLearn to drive, everything is a chore. You are looking at everything. You\ncannot have a conversation. You\u0026rsquo;re trying to make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re doing\neverything right. By the time you\u0026rsquo;ve passed your test and you\u0026rsquo;ve been\ndriving for a few years, basically what you\u0026rsquo;ve done is you\u0026rsquo;ve now changed\nyour mode of thinking about how you\u0026rsquo;re driving into fast thinking because\nit\u0026rsquo;s much more common in your driving and what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. It\u0026rsquo;s easy,\nit\u0026rsquo;s automatic, it\u0026rsquo;s emotional, it\u0026rsquo;s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 07:41\nError prone to an extent, but you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 07:43\nDo get through that. Basically what Carmen talked about in the Fast and\nslow Thinking is most of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 07:50\nUs, on an average day, we tend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 07:53\nTo have these models that we\u0026rsquo;ve built for ourselves in how we interpret\neverything into fast thinking. And it\u0026rsquo;s very important that we use these\nthings because when we\u0026rsquo;re doing what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to do, whether we\u0026rsquo;re\nat work, whether we\u0026rsquo;re as users in front of our computers trying to do\nthings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 08:12\nOr anything else, that we have in life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 08:15\nWe try to do things in the fast way of thinking and try and come up with\nways that we can reduce the burden on our brains to have to do slow\nthinking. It is something that requires you to rethink about what you\u0026rsquo;re\ndoing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 08:31\nAnd now I\u0026rsquo;m going to break there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 08:33\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to this train of thought in a short while. What I want to\ndo is just look at the NCSE Data Breach Survey from 2023. So that came\nout in April, so about two months ago. And one of the first few things that\nit covers is about the percentage of organizations that have carried out\nthe following activities to identify cyber risks within the last twelve\nmonths. So it\u0026rsquo;s things like using specified specific tools designed for\nsecurity monitoring, risk assessment tested staff, which includes mock\nphishing exercises. And if you look at that\u0026rsquo;s 19 and 16% there carried out\ncybersecurity vulnerability audits, penetration testing, invested in threat\nintelligence, but the one I\u0026rsquo;d stick to is the one in the middle in terms of\ntesting staff. Next one trends over time compared to 22. The deployment\nof the various controls and procedures has fallen amongst businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 09:33\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ve highlighted that one towards the bottom there. The agreed\nprocess for phishing emails is actually down from 57% to 48%. And notice\nthat there\u0026rsquo;s 19% that use phishing exercises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 09:51\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s down if you move to the next one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 09:53\nAgain, I\u0026rsquo;ll highlight phishing because it is the biggest category there. So\nthis is the percentage that have identified the following types of breaches\nor tax in the last twelve months among the organizations that have\nidentified any breach or tax. So if you just take those, forget all the others.\nThe highest and the biggest problem there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 10:14\nWhat\u0026rsquo;S being stated is phishing attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 10:17\nThe next one down is others impersonating organizations in email or\nonline. Now that\u0026rsquo;s 31%, so you\u0026rsquo;re going from 79 to 31, the second one\ndown. So that identifies how big a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 10:32\nIn that respect phishing attacks are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 10:35\nNext, among the organizations identified any breach or tax,\napproximately half of these business and 54% of charities say that they.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 10:44\nOnly experience phishing attacks and no other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 10:47\nKind of breach or tax. This falls to a third amongst the largest businesses,\nwhich is 33% and a similar proportion amongst the medium size.\nSpecifically medium and large organizations are more likely to report\nphishing attacks, 93% of large businesses and 84% medium businesses\nversus 79 of overall. That is quite a high percentage. Next, let\u0026rsquo;s go to\npercentage that report the foreign types of breaches or tax as the most\ndisruptive, including the organizations have only identified phishing\nattacks in the last twelve months. That\u0026rsquo;s 59 and 64. Again fairly high. And\nthe next one down is 35. And again, if you look at it\u0026rsquo;s roughly not the\nsame, but the second one is in the 13. The point I\u0026rsquo;m making there, what\nconstitute a crime? So this was quite interesting in the survey they define\nwhat they\u0026rsquo;re considered a crime. This survey covers multitude, so multiple\nforms of cybercrime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 11:46\nTowards the bottom you got phishing attacks that individuals responded\nto, for example by opening an attachment or that contained personal data\nabout the recipient and did not lead to any further crimes being\ncommitted. But still they\u0026rsquo;ve identified that as a crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 12:00\nNow in the next section that they.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 12:02\nGo through, and again, where fishing is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 12:04\nMentioned, it covers all types of cybersecurity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 12:08\nBreaches or tax that resulted in a cybercrime. And it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that\nmost of the 11% of businesses and 8% of charities that identified\ncybercrimes are referring to phishing related cybercrimes where\nindividuals responded. So again, those numbers there and the highlights\nthere because they do talk about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 12:26\nPhishing in a big way, the nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 12:29\nOf the cybercrimes experience will obviously from the figures I\u0026rsquo;ve shown\nyou, we\u0026rsquo;re talking about phishing. Now the percentage of organizations\nthat have identified the following types of cybercrime in the last twelve\nmonths amongst organizations. And again, this particular thing is slightly\ndifferent in terms of attacks. So you\u0026rsquo;ve got fishing at the top, the next one\ndown. Most of you will remember that a couple of years ago ransomware\nwas the big thing and now we\u0026rsquo;ve got viruses, spyware or malware. And\nransomware is way down as 4% compared to viruses, spyware, malware,\nwhich is 12%. And phishing attacks is still way up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 13:12\nThere at the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 13:14\nUsing these results from the breach server, this is what they estimate. So\n70,000 non phishing crimes in the last twelve months. UK charities that\u0026rsquo;s\nin UK business, sorry, and UK charity, experienced approximately 785,000\ncybercrimes of all sorts of all types in the last twelve months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 13:34\nSo again, it is what we\u0026rsquo;re talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 13:39\nPhishing is a major thing as far as NCSE are concerned. So some of the\nother data that we\u0026rsquo;ve got, I\u0026rsquo;m going to quickly flash that through. And this\nother data isn\u0026rsquo;t about the crimes itself, it\u0026rsquo;s what they did as a result of\nwhat they found. So this particular chart is percentage of businesses and\ncharities that had any of the foreign outcomes among the organizations\nthat have identified breaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 14:09\nSo as a result of a response, what happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 14:13\nAnd basically we\u0026rsquo;re talking about 8% and 7% of charities whereby the\nwebsite or online services were taken down or made slower. So you\u0026rsquo;re\ngoing all the way down. So if you look at all these, some of these are quite\nsmall as percentages, but keep that in mind because I\u0026rsquo;m going to come\nback to that. And this here is percentage that were impacted by any of the\nfollowing ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 14:37\nAmong the organizations that identified breaches, listed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 14:41\nAny impact, we\u0026rsquo;re talking about 37 added staff. So as a result of that, they\nadded staff to staff time to deal with the breach itself. New measures were\nneeded for future tax to try and protect them. They stopped staff carrying\nout daily work, other repairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 14:58\nNow, in all of that, interestingly enough, it goes from a fairly sort of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 15:05\nMediocre 37% down to 0%. And I will come back to these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 15:09\nStats in a short while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 15:11\nSo sensitive organizations have done any of the following since they\u0026rsquo;re\nmost disrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 15:16\nSo the highest thing there is whether they took action, and the action was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 15:22\nStaff training and communication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 15:24\nAnd we don\u0026rsquo;t have the stats which.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 15:27\nSay what staff training it was specifically whether it was around phishing\nor whether it was normal awareness, maybe password training, maybe\nsomething else, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say, but it is staff training that they\u0026rsquo;re\ntalking about and they\u0026rsquo;re just talking about additional staff training. The\nnext thing is install changed or updated antivirus or malware solutions,\nand that is nine and 6%. So we\u0026rsquo;re going from 19 and 28 in the charities,\nthe top one, to slightly smaller numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 15:58\nNow this one here, I know it seems like a bit of a I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 16:03\nChart and it is for me at my age, 57% of, sorry, percentage of\norganizations have done any of the following since they\u0026rsquo;re most disruptive,\nthe top thing there is changed or updated Firewall. Updated passwords\ntraining comes down at 10%, there installed a changed updated\nantimalware is third.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 16:23\nBut if you look at that, the.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 16:24\nFact that training is the third one down and that still comes out at 10%.\nSo they\u0026rsquo;re doing lots and lots of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 16:35\nDifferent things, which is strange because it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 16:38\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;T necessarily fit the story. And if we look at some of the key fishing\npoints from or, sorry, the key points around fishing from that survey, 19%\ntested staff with mock phishing exercises. Businesses with agreed\nprocesses went down from 57 to 48. 79% of business identified phishing\nattacks as the top, as the number one. And yet phishing attacks was 93%\nin large organization, 84 in medium, although it was 79 overall. And\nphishing attacks is the number one most disruptive attack. And again, I\u0026rsquo;ve\ntaken that figure from the different groups of charts that I showed you.\nYet they may not always know the complete outcome of an attack because\nmost of those showed in terms of the way that they responded, weren\u0026rsquo;t\nalways sure what was the outcome and why they took a particular action.\nSo the impacts website changes or online services taken down or made\nslower, which was 8%, and temporary loss of access to files and networks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 17:46\nSo those are the sorts of impacts we\u0026rsquo;re talking about. However, staff\ntraining was down, was number one at 19% and changed an updated\nfirewall or system configuration was the next one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 18:00\nSo not in the survey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 18:03\nOther surveys that I\u0026rsquo;ve picked up talk about 91% of advanced cyber\nattacks begin with some sort of an email. 81% of all malware attacks\ncome from phishing attempts. Email as an attack starting point continues\nto work and it works because it works. Why would anyone change it?\nEven if AI isn\u0026rsquo;t used, phishing emails still give a return and a good return\nwithout any issues. Phishing as a service seems to be thriving. Email\naddresses are one of the cheapest marketing commodities around. Our\nemail addresses are sold from one organization to another, anyone can\nbuy them. And phishing responses are all seem to be about advice to users\nand simulations. Responses which block too many emails are considered\nto be too disruptive in many respects and have been for quite some time.\nPeople say, oh, I was due to get an email, but it was blocked. Can you\nunblock it, can you do this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 19:03\nAnd organizations find that quite disruptive as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 19:07\nAnd the thing is, if you think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 19:09\nAbout it, criminals don\u0026rsquo;t need to use AI. They can succeed and they can\ncarry on benefiting from what they\u0026rsquo;re doing because we\u0026rsquo;ve seen that it\nworks, it absolutely works from the NCSE statistics. But the thing is, if the\nattackers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 19:25\nStarted to use AI, it\u0026rsquo;s an article.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 19:29\nEarlier this year, March the 8th, talking about AI taking phishing attacks\nto a whole new level of sophistication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 19:36\nSo when they\u0026rsquo;re getting this, what do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 19:39\nYou think is going to be what do you think in your own organization?\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to be dealing with we\u0026rsquo;re going to be dealing with the phishing\nbeing a major disruptor already. In some respects it is, but it\u0026rsquo;s perhaps\ngoing to get even worse than it has been before. And the sorts of advice\nthat we\u0026rsquo;ve been giving our users and I was amazed. The first two thing I\ncouldn\u0026rsquo;t believe, I searched this online. I started to copy that down and I\nthought to myself, I\u0026rsquo;m going to include this, although it\u0026rsquo;s nonsense. Avoid\nphishing. How is that good advice? I pulled that off the internet when I\nwas doing searches for advice for reducing phishing. The advice for\nreducing phishing is avoid phishing. Next one was be cautious about spam\nemails to avoid phishing. So there\u0026rsquo;s a whole bunch of things that we\u0026rsquo;ve\nsaid to people in the past and most of these I know I\u0026rsquo;m guilty of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 20:36\nI have typos in my messages. Sometimes I send out messages that are\nurgent and have typos. Some of them are attachments and I may be\nasking somebody to do something, which is great, but I have grammar\nissues. Sometimes Salutation may be wrong, there is no email address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 20:56\nAll of those things that we give.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 20:59\nAdvice to ordinary users to figure out whether something is actually a\nphishing message or not are the sort of things that everyone\u0026rsquo;s guilty of and\nwe receive and we write messages with these sorts of things in them. I\u0026rsquo;m\ngoing to show something now. It\u0026rsquo;s not my work, it\u0026rsquo;s work of some security\npeople and I haven\u0026rsquo;t got permission for it, but it is out on the internet. And\nbecause it\u0026rsquo;s out on the internet, I\u0026rsquo;m using it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 21:27\nAnd basically I\u0026rsquo;m using it to illustrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 21:31\nHow sophisticated the attacks are coming. And really the question that\nwas being asked in this chat on LinkedIn was what phishing templates do\nyou think is the most sneakiest? So really this was around phishing\nsimulations and this is around the idea and the people who did the work\non this. It\u0026rsquo;s absolutely brilliant work. Nothing wrong with the work at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 21:54\nBut I just think that it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 21:57\nDifficult for ordinary users. I find if I had to pull these things out and spot\nthese things in ordinary messages, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I could do it. So this one\nhere, it\u0026rsquo;s vague, but how financial services make their decisions is never\npredictable. Like most fishing, the impact of ignoring it is always dropped\ninto the message. Yes, absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 22:22\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;d be able.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 22:23\nTo respond to that in the right way and suss out that it could be fishing.\nThis one here, starting as it means to go on being direct and authoritative,\nthe window to act is clearly stated as it is. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s a requirement.\nAgain, simple thing, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 22:45\nTo pick it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 22:45\nThis one here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 22:48\nMaybe I should.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 22:49\nLook, I\u0026rsquo;m being curious, not nosy. Maybe you should, maybe you\nshouldn\u0026rsquo;t. Another one. These five, they are absolutely brilliant. And I can\nimagine that AI could actually craft these in such a way that any security\nperson could possibly fall for these. And if not any, then at least ten to\n15%. And that\u0026rsquo;s probably all these people are looking for. In the worst\ncase, 5%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 23:20\nHowever, most of the phishing stats that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 23:22\nI\u0026rsquo;ve read in the past is they\u0026rsquo;re looking for returns of about 1%. Quite often\nthey\u0026rsquo;re looking for small returns. And the thing is, AI is going to get better.\nAnd what we\u0026rsquo;re doing in our response to AI going into phishing and our\nresponse to what\u0026rsquo;s out there and what we\u0026rsquo;re expecting people to do is\nwe\u0026rsquo;re expecting our users, first of all, to remember every phishing\ntechnique that we\u0026rsquo;ve covered in the last few years in every email they read,\nwe want them to learn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 23:49\nSorry, just a quick one. So those examples on the previous page, they were\ncreated by an AI engine?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 23:57\nNo, this was crafted not by an AI agent. This was crafted by a company\nthat does user when it\u0026rsquo;s training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 24:04\nOkay, cool. You can totally see how we\u0026rsquo;re not that far off from taking that\nand generating also, in fact, creating custom to the user, almost taking\ninto account the user and context, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 24:16\nAbsolutely right. It\u0026rsquo;s taking it the next level. So the point I\u0026rsquo;m making here,\nwe\u0026rsquo;re trying to get into spot techniques in every single email from fast\nthinking to slow syncing. And we\u0026rsquo;re asking them to do this for every single\nemail they get. And we\u0026rsquo;re causing stress related sorry, skewed related\nstress. That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ve heard that this is a term, I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at some\nresearch and how it\u0026rsquo;s caused and all of that is causing our users to be non\ncompliant. And, and that causes a whole range of different types of\nfatigue. And that fatigue may not hit them instantly, but these different\ntypes of fatigue end up leading to ineffective user awareness outcomes.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not where we should be going. And the thing is, the reality is that\nphishing isn\u0026rsquo;t going to go away because it works. As I\u0026rsquo;ve said earlier on, if\nanything, it carries on working, it\u0026rsquo;s going to increase, not decrease the\ntypes of phishing has been and will continue to increase with the\ntechnology and with the different types of sites and the services that we\nget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 25:19\nThere will be phishing emails that related to AI as well, that will claim to\nbe from AI that\u0026rsquo;s identified something that you may have been looking for.\nThe number of emails everyone gets isn\u0026rsquo;t going to go down. That\u0026rsquo;s\nincreasing, especially because everything\u0026rsquo;s going digital. Whether you\nwant points for your shopping, whether you want to set up an account\nwith a shopping site. No matter what you look at. Everything we do now,\neven communication with our council, everything, expects you to give up\nan email address of yours. The inventiveness of attackers will get better.\nAnd when it comes to target attacks, yes, they will be using AI. Why\nwouldn\u0026rsquo;t they be using AI? Not that they have to, is what I said earlier on.\nTargeted attacks are the hardest to train against. How are we going to\ntrain? I mean, we\u0026rsquo;ve given five examples there, and they were put together\nby smart people who do anti malware sorry, anti phishing training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 26:18\nAnd they are going to get smart and they\u0026rsquo;re going to be customized. And I\nguess really what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to get to is when we reach the breaking point\nof relying on our.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 26:28\nUsers to do this sort of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 26:32\nWhile we\u0026rsquo;re actually slowing them down in their productivity and the cost\nof all these things, it might seem like it\u0026rsquo;s fairly straightforward. Training\npeople, monthly costs or updates, train people, update phishing. This is the\nlatest thing. This is what you need to look out for. Could be five to ten\nminutes a month. Simulations on that, five to ten. So if you add the two\ntogether, let\u0026rsquo;s say it\u0026rsquo;s ten to 20,000 users, that\u0026rsquo;s ten to 20,000 minutes a\nyear, which is about 167 to 333 hours, which comes down to between 22\nto 44 days. And if we average it to a month, that\u0026rsquo;s about 5000 pounds on\naverage salary. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem that expensive. And the cost of training\nand simulations could be anything from three to 20 pounds per user per\nmonth, which would be anything from 36 up to seems okay in some\nrespects to many people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 27:24\nBut what we\u0026rsquo;re not thinking about is the hidden costs and the impacts of\nphishing responsibilities onto our users. The fact that we\u0026rsquo;re putting these\nresponsibilities, they\u0026rsquo;re changing from what\u0026rsquo;s? Normal fast thinking to\nslow syncing. Whether they expect to have the conversation via an email\nwith someone or not is irrelevant because it could be new, it could be\nexisting conversation. Whatever it is, it\u0026rsquo;s still a cost to have to think about\nwhether or not this is that same or not same conversation and that cost of\ndisruption to users. And the more messages they get, the greater the total\ncost per day per user of that disruption in the way that their brains are\nworking, in the way that they\u0026rsquo;re thinking. So user interface design realized\nthat even using the wrong colors has an impact on interrupting the user\nflow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 28:12\nAnd the strange thing is, if user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 28:14\nInterface design is the same, why except why do we not understand that\nwe are absolutely interrupting the flow of productivity? And the extra cost\nof that, I really think are absolutely astronomical if were to try and\ncalculate them. I did try and do some calculations before for this\npresentation, but I thought they may be too wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 28:36\nAnd without some academic sort of rigor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 28:41\nIt\u0026rsquo;S going to be meaningless. So I will move this particular presentation.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not towards the end yet, but I will try and get to a point where I can\npresent those the impacts of these things. So regardless of all this training,\nfishing is still the number one impact of crime. So yes, there\u0026rsquo;s been\nsimulations going on, yes, there\u0026rsquo;s been user training. And regardless of all\nthat, we\u0026rsquo;ve still got phishing as a number one thing. So since phishing is a\nmajor disruption, let\u0026rsquo;s assume that because too many phishing emails get\nthrough, we can either spend more time teaching people how to interrupt\ntheir workflow by thinking slow and thinking through the simulation\ntraining, or we can spend more on technology to reduce them in getting\nthrough in the first place. And we do need to start thinking differently. We\nneed to sort of start figuring out the human error is the single source of\nbreaches is what we hear so often, yet all of our staff are also considered\nto be our best defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 29:42\nSo really we should be thinking about what is that humans do so badly,\nwhat is it they\u0026rsquo;re bad at, what is it they\u0026rsquo;re good at? And in terms of our\ndefenses and being the largest source of the breaches, users should focus\non things that AI can\u0026rsquo;t do and things that they can do. Because at the\nmoment, we know for a fact that AI cannot do the work that we do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 30:05\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a fact right there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 30:07\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not a surprise. So without AI in phishing tools, we know that rules\nbased technologies work if we can pick out the latest things that our users\nshould be looking out for. And I find that amazing that there\u0026rsquo;s so many\nanti phishing solutions out there. And yet, although there\u0026rsquo;s so many\nantifishing solutions out there, the volume of phishing simulations from\nwhat I think the first anti phishing simulation tool I came across was\nabout 2008, 2009, and there was one company, and I forget the name, and\nit was the only one. And I remember speaking to them several times on\nimprovements that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t should be making. And that was 1415\nyears ago and that was the simulation. So in terms of where we\u0026rsquo;ve got to\nfrom there to now, so many things have changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 30:56\nAnd with all of those things, if our experts can pick out what it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 31:02\nIs that we need to be looking out for, why is it we can\u0026rsquo;t stick those into\nrules and stop it so that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to train our people to start looking\nfor these sorts of things? And AI is smarter, it absolutely is smarter than all\nusers when it\u0026rsquo;s been taught the techniques. Dennis\u0026rsquo;s presentation showed\nthat if it\u0026rsquo;s been taught, has a list of enterprise specific rules in terms of\nphishing, whatever rules the enterprise has got, if it\u0026rsquo;s got a list of\nregistered domains. And the reason that\u0026rsquo;s a good one is. I know that their\nsolutions and the way that they work and why that sort of thing is\nimportant is it will stop users clicking on any domain that was registered\nin the last day, week, month, whatever it might be that you want to set\nyour controls to. And I know that phishing emails rose a couple of years\nago when COVID started, and NCSE did say at that time when went into\nlockdown, that they noticed a range, an extra couple of thousand domain\nnames being registered at that time and they start to be used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 32:07\nSo they were registered and they were used within a very short space of\ntime for lots and lots of things. And again, you can use these sorts of tools.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s not that complex in adding these things in. We need to be reducing\nuser thought, action and response in terms of fatigue. We need to limit\nwhat people need to know to very extreme small set of messages because\nthis is a disruption from the work that they are there to do. We need to\nlimit what they need to do about messages other than the work they need\nto do to get things done. We need to keep tasks that should be performed\nby technology separately from those that should be performed by humans,\nand actively looking for ways to help them become more aware by having\nless to do in response. In training, they always talk about three things that\nyou need to focus on three things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 33:00\nAnd really we\u0026rsquo;re talking about anti phishing simulations covering lots and\nus as users having to remember all these things. I really don\u0026rsquo;t like having\nto remember all these different things myself as a user, what they have to\ndo, what do users have to do, and whatever it is that they need to do, it\nshould be clear, it should be simple, it should be quick, they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have\nto think about it. But at the moment, with all the different techniques,\nthey\u0026rsquo;re having to think a lot outside their comfort zone. So remember, our\nusers are not there for us, they\u0026rsquo;re not our human firewall, and they are\nthere to add value to the business, not because we can\u0026rsquo;t be bothered to\nfind better phishing. Blockers if your border firewall was broken down,\nwould you expect your users to replace it and would you expect them to\ndeal with so if they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t, why would we expect them to deal with\nphishing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 33:51\nIt\u0026rsquo;s similar sorts of thing, because the onslaught of, I guess, traffic that we\nused to get when we first started to implement Firewalls is the same as it\nis now when we\u0026rsquo;re talking about phishing emails that we get messages,\nemail messages have been growing similar to the sort of responses that\nbrought our firewalls into place. And if the users are smart, sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 34:17\nAI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 34:20\nIs not smart enough to do the work. Our users are smart enough to do the\nwork. And we should make our users think slow. Sorry, making our users\nthink slow is they\u0026rsquo;re losing battle in the long term. And I think that we will\nget to a point where the number of phishing messages we get, it\u0026rsquo;s not\ngoing to be very good. So, question are our users smarter than AI? Yes,\nthey are. They\u0026rsquo;re infinitely smart than AI because AI couldn\u0026rsquo;t do their jobs\nby a long shot. But let\u0026rsquo;s help by reducing the total decisions that users\nhave to make or think about so they can get on and doing the jobs that\nonly they can do. AI should be able to do the other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 34:56\nSo AI, our users are not smart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 34:59\nIn AI because they cannot analyze loads and loads of different messages\nand loads of things in a short space of time in a way that I said I\u0026rsquo;m not as\nsmart as AI. AI can do loads of things that we cannot do. And if AI that\nyou\u0026rsquo;re using isn\u0026rsquo;t good enough, we should be offloading the work that AI\ncannot do off to our users. Because so far many organizations, the way\nthat they\u0026rsquo;re using phishing simulations, we\u0026rsquo;re actually doing exactly that.\nWe should be keeping our messages focused on the most important things\nthat our users can\u0026rsquo;t do. And if your AI can\u0026rsquo;t do it, complain to your vendor,\nfind another vendor, don\u0026rsquo;t transfer the action of the risk response onto our\nusers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 35:43\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 35:43\nI\u0026rsquo;ll stop there. And that\u0026rsquo;s the end of my presentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 35:47\nI will stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 35:50\nCan you expand on that last point? I think it\u0026rsquo;s quite interesting. Can you\nexpand on your last point on shifting the things to the AI, to the users?\nBecause it\u0026rsquo;s quite an interesting point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 36:05\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 36:06\nCan you go like some examples?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 36:10\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m saying is I\u0026rsquo;ve searched the number and I tried deliberately not to\npoint to any single vendor. But there are whole bunch of claim to have\nreally good AI. Now, a year ago I would have laughed anyone that said\nthat to me. And it has been getting better and it will get better, but we\u0026rsquo;re\nnot there yet. But it\u0026rsquo;s certainly better than lying on our users. The number\nof vendors that claim to do this has been growing, especially with AI get it\ngetting better. So I\u0026rsquo;m just talking about any aspect. I think we need to\nfocus on giving our users time back in any way that we can. If phishing\nsimulations is part of it and we do it slowly, then that\u0026rsquo;s fine. If it\u0026rsquo;s not, we\nneed to think about our own organization. Some of the things that I\u0026rsquo;ve\ndone in the past in terms of the question you\u0026rsquo;ve asked me is we\u0026rsquo;ve started\nto in some places I\u0026rsquo;ve worked at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 37:06\nWhat we start to do was rather than use blanket simulations, we start to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 37:11\nLook at specific users that we think are going to be high risk and those\nthat are much low risk. Those that we think are high risk. We give them\nspecific ones sort of things that they\u0026rsquo;ll encounter, other people, other\nthings that they\u0026rsquo;ll encounter. And I know that many people say they\nalready are doing this. I think what we need to do is where we are still\ndoing it is to do it as fine Tuningly as if were actually fishing ourselves\nwith that target group. Many of the fishing exercise I\u0026rsquo;ve seen and some\npeople complain about is that they have blanket fishing. Things really take\nup too much of their time and what they learn from them is not much\nbecause basically, as I\u0026rsquo;ve said, we still have the same phishing problem\nwe\u0026rsquo;ve always had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 37:53\nYeah, that makes sense. Actually, I guess an interesting evolution of this is\nthat, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think we that far off is when we actually start to get the\nAIS to read our email, right, to basically start cleaning up. And they might\nactually be quite effective, even if just trimming saying, look, based on\nyour history, based on your analysis, especially when it comes customized,\nthis is the one that matters, the ones that don\u0026rsquo;t matter. And this one is a bit\nweird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 38:20\nWhy is that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 38:22\nAs good as that? As you say, instead of blocking them and I\u0026rsquo;m saying\nblocking the first instance because it just sounds easier. But what the AI\ndoes is messages come to you exactly what you said they point out, say\nlook, this message come from this person and the CFO but it seems like\nit\u0026rsquo;s come from a Gmail address. Are you expecting it? So they basically\nhighlight the things that you need that are different and you make the\ndecision. And if you make the wrong decision, that is totally okay. But\nwhat you\u0026rsquo;re not doing is spending thinking slow and thinking fast, doing\nnormal work to something that\u0026rsquo;s a chore, that security people expect you\nto do as a result of the training that they\u0026rsquo;ve given you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 39:01\nYeah, and I guess one of the ways I will scale is because a lot of sometimes\nthe detection is done at the edge where they don\u0026rsquo;t have context. Where the\nmore the models understand, your inbox understand, like I said, your\nrelationships, the graphs and maybe able to be a lot more effective. And\nthen in a weird way maybe we can actually start to have somer tooling\ntalking to each other where we can say hey, imagine a world where in that\nmoment in time the crew and EDR tools that you have in the device go\nhey, by the way, pay attention because something bad might be happening.\nA lot of tools, sometimes they cannot do as much as they could because of\nperformance. Right. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of like a lot of our security models that we\ncould be very focused on some activity, but that brings everything down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 39:47\nBut if you know that you\u0026rsquo;re only doing it for a small period of time or\nwhen it\u0026rsquo;s a bit more dangerous. Yeah, so that integration is again, I think\nthat context, that is starting to be possible now, where even five or six\nmonths ago, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t really see how we\u0026rsquo;re going to get to that level of\nautomation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 40:06\nTo replace that or to respond to that. I guess my techniques that I\u0026rsquo;ve\nalways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 40:12\nUsed everywhere I\u0026rsquo;ve went, because you never.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 40:15\nKnow, and you move around a lot, you never know what techniques or\nwhat tools are going to be in place. So you techniques yourself and\napproaches that work for you no matter where you go. So for me, what I\ndo is my inbox. Anything that\u0026rsquo;s important, that\u0026rsquo;s critical, where I have to\npay attention, that where I might be fished. What I do is I create folders\nthat work for me, and I automatically create a rule using my email client\nthat will move that if it\u0026rsquo;s from that user into another folder. And if I get an\nemail from that person that stays in the inbox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 40:49\nItself, that means there\u0026rsquo;s something wrong with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 40:53\nIt hasn\u0026rsquo;t moved. Little things like that, which we all have techniques, and\nwe shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to figure out these techniques. We should be able to\nhave a single inbox. Everything is sorted by itself, by the AI, by our AI\nemail clients, which points to us all those things that we\u0026rsquo;ve just been\ntalking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 41:15\nYeah, no, that\u0026rsquo;s a cool technique and yeah, looking forward to having I\nmanage my email bots a little bit over the place at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 41:25\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to develop this a bit further. So a couple of months time, I may\ndo another one related to this. But the next stage of where I think it\u0026rsquo;s gone\nand where I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to be useful, because I think this is what I\u0026rsquo;m\nvery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 41:37\nInterested in is user behavior and how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 41:41\nUsers take on our relationship with security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 41:45\nBut the one that I told you we really want to expand is on the users as\nhuman sensors. And actually, if you look at the Kneban framework, that\nworld, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of I think those guys I think it was Snowden, david\nSnowden. Dave Snowden. If you look at the work he\u0026rsquo;s done, he came to\none of the summit, actually, and did some really cool stuff, but he kind of\nhad this Knebbing framework, and a lot of it is about human sensors. So\nhe expanded on he thinks about complex and think chaos, complex orders\nand something else for a while. But yeah, check it out, because I think it\u0026rsquo;s\nquite interesting. But I really like that human sensors concept where in a\nway, we should be looking at users as our best assets. One of the messages\nthat we try to push, but it\u0026rsquo;s always a bit hard, but I try to encourage even\nthe users is that what I would have an issue is if the user don\u0026rsquo;t let us know,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 42:49\nLike, if the user sees something and don\u0026rsquo;t let us know, even if they do\nsomething and don\u0026rsquo;t let us know means we lose a lot of time. Like, for\nexample, if they send the email to the wrong person, think initially the user\nmight go, oh, let me see if I\u0026rsquo;m in trouble, where actually I almost want to\nturn the pivot around and say, look, you are only in trouble if you don\u0026rsquo;t tell\nus. If you tell us, we could do something about it. We don\u0026rsquo;t want to be\ncatching it at the other end. Not that the user should be in trouble, but I\nthink we need to create this culture of the human senses and they should\nbe empowered and we should have the ability to process the data because\nit means that we\u0026rsquo;re going to get a lot more data, we\u0026rsquo;re going to get a lot\nmore false positives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 43:24\nBut I much prefer the users to be triggered happy than trigger unhappy,\nwhere when they do something that maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a bit weird, they don\u0026rsquo;t\nacknowledge it and they don\u0026rsquo;t raise suspicious. So that means we can\u0026rsquo;t\ncalibrate the thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 43:39\nAnd there has been some research done and I mentioned it and I\u0026rsquo;ve read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 43:42\nQuite a bit around users getting fatigued as a result of all the different\nthings they have to do and what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 43:52\nMakes them respond in the right way, what makes them respond in the\nwrong way. So there has been some research done in the UK as well, and\nit\u0026rsquo;s moving forward and there is beginning to be more and more work\ndone, because, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if you know, but the number of universities\nthat are now doing Masters and PhDs in cyber has been growing over the\nlast seven, eight years. And it\u0026rsquo;s fantastic. It\u0026rsquo;s really good. And some of the\nthings that they look at are users, not just the side beside of things that\nyou and I may be interested in. And they\u0026rsquo;re looking at stress and stress it\u0026rsquo;s\ncausing users. So it\u0026rsquo;s all very exciting stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 44:29\nYeah, cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 44:30\nAll right, man, brilliant.

fall short. This presentation introduces \u0026ldquo;AttackGen\u0026rdquo;, a groundbreaking tool that seamlessly integrates the MITRE ATT\u0026amp;CK framework with state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). Attendees will be taken on a journey from a live demonstration of AttackGen\u0026rsquo;s capabilities to a deeper exploration of its mechanics.

And we have Matt Adams, who I\u0026rsquo;m going to kick\nstart one of our a lot of our sessions we have dedicated to LLMs and this\nis going to be on the Attack Gen, which is a really cool tool and\ntechnology he\u0026rsquo;s been working on how to actually start creating\nsimulations. And I\u0026rsquo;ll just mention it I think is the kind of tool and the kind\nof use of LLMs that I think is super useful and we can add a lot of value\nthese moments with the LLMs that we have. So Matt, over to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 00:38\nThanks very much and good afternoon. Good evening. Good morning\neveryone. Thanks for joining wherever you happen to be watching. So, just\nto introduce myself, my name is Matt Adams. I\u0026rsquo;m a security architect at\nSantander UK. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked in cybersecurity for almost 20 years. So I\nstarted out as a big four consultant with one of the big cybersecurity\npractices. I then became an independent contractor working across\ngovernment and financial services sectors. And then in recent years, I\u0026rsquo;ve\ntaken up permanent security architecture roles with Costcoffee, part of\nthe Coca Cola Group, and latterly with Santander. And when I\u0026rsquo;m not at\nwork, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a few quite varied hobbies. So I live on a small holding in\nthe North Buckinghamshire countryside in England, which is where I\u0026rsquo;m\njoining you from this evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 01:42\nAnd when I\u0026rsquo;m not out in the fields looking after sheep and chickens, I\u0026rsquo;ve\ngot my own home lab. And I enjoy coding my own projects, which is where\na lot of this experimentation with large language models has come from,\nreally? As I\u0026rsquo;ve looked for ways to take problems that I come across in my\nday job and in my personal life and look to see how I can apply those\nmodels to make myself and my colleagues and others more efficient and\nmore productive. So our agenda for the talk, just going to try and bring\neverybody up to speed on what I think is the current position with incident\nresponse testing. We\u0026rsquo;ll then take a dive into the architecture and building\nblocks of this tool that I\u0026rsquo;ve developed called Attack Gen. I\u0026rsquo;ll then give you\na couple of demos of the tool we\u0026rsquo;ll look at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 02:37\nThe well roadmap is perhaps slightly too grand the term, but the next\nthings that I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of for building on version 0.2 of the tool that\u0026rsquo;s\nthere at the moment and then I\u0026rsquo;ll wrap up with some of my thoughts on\nhow do you ideate use cases for language models and what are some of\nwhat I would consider to be the best practices when it comes to\nimplementing these types of tools in an organization? And if we got some\ntime, I\u0026rsquo;m happy to take questions at the end. So, incident response testing\nfor me, again, I\u0026rsquo;m a security architect. This isn\u0026rsquo;t my sort of day in and day\nout job. But I have participated and run incident response exercises in the\npast. For me, incident response is a skill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 03:37\nAnd like any skill, the more you practice, the more you refine, the better\nyou\u0026rsquo;re going to be at it. And so you\u0026rsquo;ll see that those teams that exercise\nmore and have more practical experience of live responses are\nunderstandably, more efficient and better at responding when it. So I\nreally like the following quote from Alan Iverson who has nothing to do\nwith cybersecurity or incident response. He\u0026rsquo;s a former NBA basketball\nplayer. But I like it because it captures a couple of different aspects of\nincident response testing. And his thought is that when you\u0026rsquo;re not\npracticing, someone else is getting better. And I think of this from two\nperspectives. One, this could be your competitors, other organizations who\nare hardening their defenses, getting better at mitigating attacks sooner\nwithin the lifecycle of an attack. But it also applies to the bad guys, to our\nadversaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 04:41\nThey\u0026rsquo;re constantly improving and trying out new attack techniques. And\nso it\u0026rsquo;s important that we continue to practice, we continue to improve our\nown games when it comes to incident response. And for organizations that\nare testing and exercising at the moment, they are taking account of this\nincreasing complexity. But it is becoming challenging to capture within an\nincident response scenario. So what you\u0026rsquo;ll see is that leading\norganizations have moved to quite complex and threat driven testing\nscenarios. So probably one of the best cases or best examples of this is the\nCvest scheme that\u0026rsquo;s sponsored by the bank of England here in the UK. And\nthat takes threat intelligence from leading threat intelligence companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 05:41\nIt combines that with assessments from intelligence services and other\nvery advanced threat intelligence sources and they then use that to\nproduce a realistic testing scenario based on an adversary or adversaries\nthat they wish to simulate during that exercise. Clearly that\u0026rsquo;s not\nachievable for all companies. And those companies that aren\u0026rsquo;t large\nfinancial services institutions or critical national infrastructure, they\u0026rsquo;re not\nreally able to replicate both the specificity of those scenarios or also the\ncomplexity simply because they lack the time and financial resources to\nachieve that same depth of testing. So what we kind of see at the moment\nthen is in more generic incident response scenarios being used by smaller\norganizations. And the reason why I\u0026rsquo;m not a particular fan of those is\nbecause they don\u0026rsquo;t really account for the organizational context that is\nrelevant to those particular companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 06:57\nAnd it may be that you\u0026rsquo;re picking up a very standard phishing based\nincident response test, but you may have really good email fences and\nactually you get quite few phishing attacks that hit end users and you\u0026rsquo;d\nbetter testing something that was more relevant to your organization. If\nyou did want to develop more tailored and specific scenarios, well, that\ntends to come with a longer lead time and cost to produce those scenarios.\nSo some of the testing and exercising that I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved in the past.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve spent sort of end to end, maybe three, four months working with a\nconsultancy to go from the sort of inception of an idea for a scenario that\nwe want to test all the way through to developing that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 07:51\nScenario, creating new injects and content to put into that exercise and\nthen finally getting people round the table to go through and exercise that\nproperly because of that lead time. My experience is that there\u0026rsquo;s a bias\ntowards larger scale tests with the side effect that tests tend to become\nless frequent. So you might have scope to do one of those a year, which I\nthink is less than ideal, and more teams would benefit from being able to\nfocus on doing smaller tests more frequently to supplement those large\nscale tests. And that was really where the idea for Attack Gen came from.\nAnd what Attack Gen is it\u0026rsquo;s a combination of the Mitra Attack framework.\nSo the data from the Mitra Attack framework combined with an OpenAI\nLLM, so in this case GPT 3.5 Turbo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 09:04\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m also then using a framework called Lang Chain, which is I think\nquite a few people are aware of it now, but it\u0026rsquo;s a framework for working\nwith language models like the GPT series. And it just makes it easier to\nhandle some of the prompt formatting. And that\u0026rsquo;s really where I\u0026rsquo;m using it\nfor in this tool. And lastly, there\u0026rsquo;s a simple but fairly effective UI delivered\nthrough Streamlit, which is a Python library, which I use for quite a few of\nmy POC tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 09:42\nMatt, can I ask you a question? Have you experimented with Four or with\nCloud Two or Lama Two, the other sort of GPT models?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 09:52\nI have, yeah. When you\u0026rsquo;re using different models though, and Langchain\ndoes try to compensate for this because the models have been trained and\nfine tuned on different data sets and different prompt structures. The way\nthat Claude, for example, will deal with a user and AI response that\nprefers, I think, XML, it does really well with sort of XML structured\ndocuments and you\u0026rsquo;ve got quite a particular structure that you need to\ngive it to get the best out of the prompts. Whereas OpenAI is a bit more\ntransparent, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to have as much work going into telling it.\nThis is the user section, this is the assistant section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 10:50\nAnd so trying to switch between, for example, GPT 3.5 and Claw Two in\nthis tool, I have tried to do it, there\u0026rsquo;s quite a lot of work that needs to go\ninto reengineering the prompts to get consistent results. And so for the\ntime being, I\u0026rsquo;ve left it just as OpenAI only tool at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 11:12\nWhat about GPT Four?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 11:15\nSo GPT Four would do a really good job because of the length of the\nresponses. I favor 3.5 Turbo just because it\u0026rsquo;s quicker and because of\nthings that you\u0026rsquo;ll see later on in the presentation, I can work with the\nslightly less capable model and still get, I think, good results from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 11:39\nYeah, that was going to be my next question because I found also that 3.5\ncan actually be really good. And there\u0026rsquo;s an interesting trend here which\nsometimes we don\u0026rsquo;t need very powerful models if we can prompt it quite\neffectively, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 11:51\nYeah, absolutely. I think there\u0026rsquo;s a lot you can do with fine tuning and\nprompt engineering to get really good results from 3.5.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 12:00\nBrilliant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 12:05\nSo just to check that we\u0026rsquo;re all on the same page when it comes to Mitre\nAttack, because that\u0026rsquo;s a fairly key part of this tool. Attack is a knowledge\nbase of adversary tactics and techniques. And the key to it is that it\u0026rsquo;s\nbased on real world observations from security analysts around the world\nwhere they\u0026rsquo;re monitoring different threat actor groups and they see these\ndifferent behaviors and techniques used by them. Attack is a really good\nway of cataloging those observations and then subsequently using them to\ndevelop threat models that we can use downstream. And probably the\nmost important feature, I think, of Attack is that it gives us a standardized\nframework to be able to understand and communicate threats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 12:53\nSo that I know if I\u0026rsquo;m in a security architecture team and I\u0026rsquo;m talking to a\nproblem that\u0026rsquo;s been detected by our incident responders, when we say\nlateral movement, we\u0026rsquo;re both talking about the same technique that was\nused to move laterally from host to host. And so it takes away a lot of the\npotential for confusion that could otherwise result. And so what you can\nsee in the image here at the bottom is a heat map that\u0026rsquo;s produced by a\ntool called Attack Navigator. And this is a mapping of some different\ntechniques that are used by two different threat actor groups. So apt three\nand apt 29. And you can sort of see the power of being able to map on\nthose different techniques because it tells you where you should probably\nfocus your efforts in terms of defending against them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 13:50\nHave you tried reverse engineering an attack into the Mitre framework?\nSo you basically say, here\u0026rsquo;s my Attack, here\u0026rsquo;s a scenario, now give me this\npath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 14:05\nRemind me about that when we come to Hallucinations, because yes was\nan example I wanted to give. So if Attack is that good, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure lots of\nyou have heard many things about the Attack framework, why do you\nneed a tool like Attack Gen in addition to it? In my experience, there\u0026rsquo;s\nquite a learning curve to Attack. So people get the concept very quickly of\nthe knowledge base and being able to have a common language for\ndiscussing different techniques and threat actor groups. But when you get\ndown and use it at a practical level, you quickly come across these long\nlists of techniques that are associated with each threat actor group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 14:57\nAnd that, in my experience, is where people sort of tend to get a bit\nbogged down because trying to get those then into something that\u0026rsquo;s useful\nbeyond just the basic understanding that Threat Actor group uses\ntechnique A, B and C, actually getting something of value out of that is a\nbit more difficult. And it takes time to learn how to use Attack Navigator,\nhow to create different layers, all of those sorts of things. And what Attack\nGen does is it tries to flatten that learning curve and reduce the time for\npeople to get value from the attack framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 15:42\nSo what you\u0026rsquo;ll see is that we can quickly select a specific Threat Actor\ngroup and then within a minute or two create a realistic testing scenario\nthat we could give to our security management or our Incident response\nfunction and ask them to build a response exercise around that. And then\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a bit of an overview of how Attack Gen works. And you\u0026rsquo;ll see this\nin the demo in a few minutes. But first off, we just asked the user to\nprovide an API key for OpenAI and to provide some very high level\ninformation about their chosen industry and the size of their organization.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s just to provide a bit of additional context to the model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 16:35\nThey then select whether they want to run a Threat group scenario, which\nis the example we\u0026rsquo;ve just covered, which is you select a threat group and\nyou then get a list of associated attack techniques back from the tool,\nwhich is then used to generate a scenario. Or recently in version 0.2 of the\ntool, I introduced this feature of custom scenarios where really the idea\nwas that for organizations that have got quite advanced threat\nintelligence capabilities, there may be threat actors that they\u0026rsquo;re tracking\nthat aren\u0026rsquo;t in the attack framework at the moment. And so they need a\nway to select specific techniques and then build a scenario around those\nparticular techniques. Again, quite quickly, but quite realistically once the\ndata has been selected so those particular techniques have been pulled\nfrom the attack framework, they then go into a Lang chain prompt\ntemplate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 17:46\nSo as I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about, Langchain is that framework that we use for\nworking with LLMs and it then allows all of that context in terms of the\nindustry, company size, the relevant techniques, all to be passed to the\nLLM in one go with a request that says you are an expert Cyber Incident\nResponder. Please produce a scenario that incorporates all of this\ninformation and context that we\u0026rsquo;ve provided. When that run occurs,\nthere\u0026rsquo;s an option to log that to a tool called Langsmith. And I\u0026rsquo;ll go into a\nbit more detail about what that does in Slide or two. And I\u0026rsquo;ve also recently\nintroduced the ability for users to provide feedback on each generation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 18:41\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s really just something that I\u0026rsquo;m using to understand how well the\ntool is performing and whether it\u0026rsquo;s producing the desired scenarios or if\nthere\u0026rsquo;s some issues that I need to delve into in a bit more detail. So this\nseems like a lot of work. Right? So when you can ask Chat GPT to\nproduce an incident response testing scenario and it will produce\nsomething like you see on the left hand side of the slide, why don\u0026rsquo;t we just\nuse that? Well, as you can see, just stepping through this, I asked Chat\nGPT to give me a scenario for Apt 41, also known as Wicked Panda, and I\ntried to make the prompt that I submitted as close to the prompt templates\nthat Attackgen uses to make this a representative test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 19:38\nSo you can see that we\u0026rsquo;re passing in this information that it\u0026rsquo;s a large\norganization and that in this case it operates in the insurance industry.\nAnd then Chat GPT starts to generate the Threat Actor profile and the\ntechniques associated with that Threat Actor group. And this is all looking\nvery credible, very reasonable as a means of explaining what this Threat\nActor is doing in their processes. So spear phishing attachments to gain\ninitial access, execution of PowerShell scripts, establishing persistence\nthrough scheduled tasks, exploiting vulnerabilities to get privilege\nescalation, all very credible. But when you go and map this back to the\nactual listing for Apt 41 on the Mitreattack website, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that several\nof these are actually not relevant for this Threat Actor group, which is a\nreal problem if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to produce realistic scenarios specifically for\na given Threat Actor group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 20:48\nSo, as we can see, GPT 3.5 and even GPT Four will hallucinate the names\nof techniques and most commonly the Attack IDs. It seems to really\nstruggle with matching the specific Attack IDs to the name of the\ntechnique. Do get quite a number of variances there. So having mentioned\nhallucinations, I thought it was probably apt to talk in a bit more detail\nabout what a hallucination is. Probably most people have heard about it\nwho\u0026rsquo;ve looked at LLMs and it\u0026rsquo;s one of the key weaknesses of these\nprobabilistic models. And so I thought, well, what better option than to\nask Chat GPT what a hallucination is? And in the response it says that\nthey\u0026rsquo;re a phenomenon where a machine learning model, particularly a\nlanguage model like GPT Four, produces outputs that seem plausible but\nare actually incorrect or nonsensical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 21:55\nSo exactly what we saw in the previous slide, and I think a really good\nanswer. What then caught me by surprise was then the hallucination that\nit follows with by saying that an LLM stands for low level Mistake, which,\nif you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with this space, again, you could find completely\ncredible and quite difficult to spot. But it sort of highlights that you\ncontinue to need this subject matter expertise to know what you\u0026rsquo;re looking\nfor or otherwise be prepared to be caught out when it comes to this type\nof generation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:34\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s a meta hallucination, right? Hallucination only explanation of\nhallucinations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 22:39\nYeah, I did wonder if I was being trolled by the model at that point. If it\njust thought it would throw that in there. And that was the first question. I\ndidn\u0026rsquo;t do this repeatedly. That was the first time I answered it. I thought it\nwas too good not to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:53\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s definitely a keeper. I agree with Sarah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 23:00\nSo to Dennis\u0026rsquo;s question earlier about reverse engineering attacks, that\nwas one of the first ideas I had when I looked at the GPT models was the\nidea that if you could take a news article or maybe just a very brief threat\nintelligence bulletin that had been produced. Perhaps you could pass that\nto a language model and say, identify all of the relevant attack techniques\nin this article and give me the references for them, the attack IDs for them\naccording to the Mitreattack framework. And while again it looked very\ncredible, I soon found that when I started to check a number of these,\nwhat you saw a couple of slides ago happened with great regularity in that\nit just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t nail the Attack IDs to the technique names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 24:08\nThere was always some variation and so when I was coming to think\nabout Attack gen, I decided to take different approach and not rely on the\nlanguage model to produce that important mapping which is really critical\nto the integrity of the scenarios. So there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a fairly complex\nsequence diagram here, but the bit that we care about is in the first steps.\nSo after we\u0026rsquo;ve logged into the streamlit app and we\u0026rsquo;ve set things like the\nAPI key and our industry and company size, the user then selects a threat\nactor group. And at that point, I\u0026rsquo;m using a very useful Python library to\njust load in the Mitreattack framework in its Stix data format stix. And it\u0026rsquo;s\nthen filtered again using just a bit of Python.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 25:10\nIt filters out all of the relevant techniques for that selected Threat Actor\ngroup and then it\u0026rsquo;s returned back to the Streamlit UI at the point the user\nclicks generate scenario. That\u0026rsquo;s when the selection of those techniques and\ntheir associated IDs is made from the application and then passed to the\nmodel. So I\u0026rsquo;m not really giving it much of a chance to hallucinate those.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not saying it\u0026rsquo;s never going to do it, but by including those in the\nhuman input prompt for the model, I found it to be very effective at\nmanaging hallucinations. I\u0026rsquo;ve not come across an instance where I\u0026rsquo;ve sent\nit list of techniques and Attack IDs and found that in the response the\nmodel has hallucinated something different. So from my experience at\nleast, it looks to be very reliable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 26:15\nWhen were walking through the block diagram earlier, I did touch on\nLangsmith and I wanted to include this because I think this topic of\nobservability and feedback capture from LLMs is going to be increasingly\nimportant as we go from this phase when everybody\u0026rsquo;s got incredibly\nexcited about language model applications and running various POCs. But\nwhen you take them to production. And quite rightly so, we get increasing\nchallenge from stakeholders to say, can you explain to me how this model\nworks? And the models are probabilistic. You can only go so far, but I\nthink tools like Langsmith are very useful in at least providing some level\nof visibility into the inner workings of the model. And so that\u0026rsquo;s why I\nwanted to include support for it with version zero two of Attack gen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 27:16\nAnd so it allows that greater level of monitoring and the ability to capture\nuser feedback as well. So you can see on the right here, we get visibility of\nthe system prompt that\u0026rsquo;s being passed to the model as part of the\ngeneration request. You can also then see all of the populated prompt\ntemplate that\u0026rsquo;s then being given to the model. So that data, all of those\ntechniques that we filtered through for this particular threat actor group,\nthat is where those appear, and then they\u0026rsquo;re submitted to the model as\npart of that generation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 27:56\nAll this code is open source, right? This is all an open source project?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 28:00\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 28:01\nVery cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 28:06\nAnd then, interestingly, then when you\u0026rsquo;re using Langsmith, you can also\nsee the responses back from the AI. So if you\u0026rsquo;re developing in house tools\nin an organization and you want to have a look at what types of requests\nare being submitted and how the AI has responded, if you got a bit of poor\nfeedback from a user. You can then go back and look at the log of the\nactual output that was generated to see potentially what went wrong, and\nmaybe tune your prompts or even look at fine tuning the model to get\nsome better responses. Okay, so time for a demo. So this is the attack gen\nStreamNet UI. I\u0026rsquo;ve already pre populated the API key that I\u0026rsquo;m using, and\nwe\u0026rsquo;ll just select an industry at random. We\u0026rsquo;ll be a media company. We\u0026rsquo;ll\nsay we\u0026rsquo;re a large ish media company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 29:14\nAnd then this is where we split into choosing a threat group scenario.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve then got all of the Threat Actor groups that are currently logged in\nthe Mitre attack framework. So let\u0026rsquo;s pick carbonate. They\u0026rsquo;re reasonably\nhigh profile. You can always look at the listing for Carbonac or the given\nThreat Act group on the attack framework that\u0026rsquo;s linked to Dynamically.\nWhen you select it. You can also then see the different techniques that are\nbeing loaded in. So behind the scenes, what\u0026rsquo;s happening is we\u0026rsquo;re using\nthat Attack Python library that I mentioned to pull data from the Styx\ndata and then load that into a Pandas data frame. And then just a bit of\nformatting occurs just to make it a bit more presentable to the user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 30:18\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll notice here that like lots of threat actor groups, this group has\nsometimes multiple techniques within a given phase. And what I\u0026rsquo;ve decided\nto do, rather than having sort of really complex or overlapping scenarios,\nis that when we come to generate the scenario if there are multiple\ntechniques per phase, one of those techniques will just be selected at\nrandom. So you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t see more than one technique per phase. And\nthat\u0026rsquo;s just to keep things relatively well structured. If you\u0026rsquo;ve got a\nrequirement to consider multiple techniques for, in this case, Defensive\nAgent, that\u0026rsquo;s where the custom scenario generation would come in. So I\u0026rsquo;ll\nhit generate scenario. This is a recent feature that was introduced by\nStreamlit, which I quite like, which is the ability to give better visibility\ninto long running processes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 31:18\nSo rather than just having a spinning wheel here with the user wondering\nwhat\u0026rsquo;s going on for a minute or two, we can see that the model has been\ninitialized successfully and the scenario generation has proceeded. It\u0026rsquo;s\nfairly straightforward in this case, but where you\u0026rsquo;ve got tools that perhaps\nhave multiple agents talking back and forth where the user might be\nwaiting for several minutes for their output, I think things like that are\nreally nice. UI tweaks that you can use just to give the user a bit more\ninsight into what\u0026rsquo;s going on. And so they\u0026rsquo;re not left thinking that\nsomething\u0026rsquo;s stalled somewhere. And then this is our incident Response\ntesting scenario. So you can see that we\u0026rsquo;ve picked up the relevant details\nfrom the prompt template in terms of type of company size and the Threat\nActor group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 32:13\nIt\u0026rsquo;s then creating the scenario based on the techniques that we selected.\nAnd if we then flicked over to Langsmith, which was that observability\ntool I mentioned, you can see that this is our latest run here. So all of that\ninformation will then be logged. This is only if you\u0026rsquo;re using the Streamlit\nLive demo app, by the way. So if you clone my repository and run it on\nyour own, you can use your own Langsmith API keys and set it up yourself\nor remove the environment variables altogether. The reason why I tested\nusing Langsmith with this tool is because really there\u0026rsquo;s not any\norganizational identifiable information beyond it\u0026rsquo;s a media company with\na couple of hundreds or a thousand employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 33:09\nSo in terms of sort demoing the capabilities of Langsmith, while not\ncreating too much of a headache for myself or people wanting to use the\ntool, this felt like a good time to use it. And then finally, if we\u0026rsquo;re happy\nwith that, we can submit our feedback and then that will also appear with\nthe run. So it\u0026rsquo;s a good way of then keeping track. I could extend this so\nthat if a user submitted negative feedback, they could provide a comment\nto explain what was wrong. It\u0026rsquo;s not something I\u0026rsquo;ve done in the public\nversion of this at the moment. And then if we flick over to custom\nscenarios. So just to give you an idea of how we would use this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 34:01\nSo if we\u0026rsquo;ve got perhaps a phishing email for initial access, that might drop\nsome malware and we\u0026rsquo;ll think about lateral movement through RDP and\nmaybe some exfiltration over a C two channel. Again, we can hit that\ngenerate scenario and it will take a few seconds to generate that. So while\nthat\u0026rsquo;s waiting, I\u0026rsquo;ll just point out that you can immediately jump to the code\non GitHub to look at this. And as Dennis said, it\u0026rsquo;s all open source. So\nwhile we\u0026rsquo;re waiting for that, I\u0026rsquo;ll give you a look at the prompt template\nthat\u0026rsquo;s used for the custom scenarios. So here you can see that this is our\nsystem templates, which is pretty consistent. And then when it comes to\nspecifying the human template, this is where we capture the industry and\ncompany size parameters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 35:13\nThose will then be, for want of a better term, stuffed into the prompt\ntemplate along with the techniques that the user has selected. And so once\nthat\u0026rsquo;s all populated, that\u0026rsquo;s what then gets submitted to the language\nmodel. And so again, that\u0026rsquo;s our scenario generated. And we can see that in\nLangsmith. Again, so slightly different output this time because we\u0026rsquo;re\nasking for a custom incident response testing scenario. It\u0026rsquo;s also interesting\nto track some of the latency around the request. So another useful feature\nof this observability platform is you can see that this is probably a\nscenario where there were quite a lot of techniques that were listed. So is\nthis what, Apt 29? Yeah. So 13 techniques were submitted. So the model is\nobviously going to take a bit more time to think about how to work with\nthose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:32\nOkay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 36:33\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to try attack Gen. So I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned the GitHub repo already.\nYou can use the Streamlit Community Cloud app as well. You can\nobviously clone or fork that app as well and run it on your own\ninfrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:53\nHave you tried with Azure OpenAI or somebody who tried it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 37:02\nYeah. So Azure OpenAI is a lot closer to sort of API formats for OpenAI.\nInterestingly. Not identical though. So again, it sort of suffers from the\nsame problem around prompt engineering. You\u0026rsquo;ve got to tweak the\nprompt slightly in order to get representative responses, but in principle,\nwith a bit of coding work, it\u0026rsquo;s absolutely possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:30\nYeah, because I think the advantage of that is that it would solve that\nproblem of if you want to run this for your own more external sensitive\ndata with live incidents right. Then at least that one doesn\u0026rsquo;t send.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 37:45\nThe data to yes. Yeah. OpenAI say that anything submitted to their API or\nvia the playground, they don\u0026rsquo;t use to train their models. Clearly though, if\nyou haven\u0026rsquo;t got commercial terms with OpenAI, but you do have\ncommercial terms with Azure, then there\u0026rsquo;s obviously a clear choice into\nwhich one you\u0026rsquo;ll use. But it\u0026rsquo;s not something that I\u0026rsquo;ve looked to integrate\ninto this tool yet, but I have done for other projects that I\u0026rsquo;m working on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:21\nCool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 38:24\nSo just to give you an idea of what you might see next from Attack Gen,\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to add some support for additional matrices from the Attack\nframework. So those of you who are more familiar with Mitre Attack will\nrecognize that we\u0026rsquo;ve only been talking about the Enterprise Attack matrix\nso far, but my plan is to add support for the mobile and industrial control\nsystem matrices. Also, with an eye on making this easier to deploy in\ncorporate environments, I\u0026rsquo;m planning to provide a docker container image\nrather than having you either run it from the Streamlit app or build it\nfrom source each time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:15\nActually, could you run it from a lambda function? I guess depends. I\u0026rsquo;m\nnot sure what Streamlit supports the lambda functions is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 39:23\nI\u0026rsquo;ve not tried to run Streamlit through a lambda. That would be\ninteresting. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure it might be performant enough. It does take a\nlittle bit of time to load the initial Mitre Attack data, but it\u0026rsquo;s probably\nwithin tolerance for a lambda function. Certainly something to experiment\nwith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:47\nCool. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 39:51\nSo I\u0026rsquo;d also like to add the ability to generate scenarios based on the\ntechniques associated with different campaigns. So currently the tool\nfocuses on the techniques that are associated with threat actor groups.\nBut Attack has this concept of campaigns where you might see perhaps\nmultiple threat actors working together targeting particular types of\norganizations and they roll that up into a construct called a campaign. So\nfor those organizations that wanted to practice it being part of a\ncampaign, I think that would be a useful addition. I\u0026rsquo;m also looking to add\nsome options for users to provide more information about their\norganization conscious that probably many won\u0026rsquo;t want to, particularly in\nthe public version, and hence I\u0026rsquo;d make it optional, but it\u0026rsquo;s something that\nI\u0026rsquo;ve done in some of my other tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 40:50\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve got a threat modeling app called Stride GPT where I just capture\nsome basic information about an environment and an application and then\nuse that to generate a threat model. I think it would be additional useful\ncontext to help generate the scenarios for this tool as well. And lastly, you\nneed to tell us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 41:15\nAbout the Stripe GPT. That sounds really interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 41:19\nYeah. So there\u0026rsquo;s a link to my GitHub repo at the end. It\u0026rsquo;s another open\nsource project of mine. So happy for you to take a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 41:29\nDo another session on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 41:33\nAnd lastly, if anyone\u0026rsquo;s got any suggestions having watched this talk, please\nraise an issue on GitHub. If you\u0026rsquo;re a developer, feel free to submit a pull\nrequest. If you\u0026rsquo;re non technical and have some ideas, then just contact me\non LinkedIn. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to make this an even more valuable tool for\norganizations as it evolves. So very happy to take ideas for improvements\nand then sort of having seen an example of an LLM app and I think it\u0026rsquo;s a\npretty good use case for the current state of LLMs and what they\u0026rsquo;re\ncapable of. I wanted to sort of move to wrapping up by thinking about\ndifferent use cases or how I think of different use cases for language\nmodels and some of the tips, really that I\u0026rsquo;ve thought of as I\u0026rsquo;ve carried on\nand learned things through the development process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 42:37\nSo when it comes to identifying use cases, my favorite way of thinking\nabout this and describing it to people is imagine you had a new intern.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re very good at written English or in fact, any language. They will\nneed supervision, they\u0026rsquo;re not going to get everything right all of the time.\nThey are definitely not your best red teamer, definitely not your best\nsecurity architect, but they\u0026rsquo;re very keen and eager to help. That\u0026rsquo;s the type\nof individual you should be thinking of when it comes to thinking about\nwhat would be a good use case for a language model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 43:25\nAll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 43:25\nThe better if the tasks that you\u0026rsquo;re going to give that intern are repetitive\nand or quite tedious tasks that can be easily automated. So setting aside\nhallucinations and other quirks of probabilistic models, gen AI models\ndon\u0026rsquo;t get bored or lose focus like humans do. And so if you\u0026rsquo;ve got a very\nrepetitive or tedious task like generating incident response scenarios very\nquickly from a standard set of data, LLMs are really good at those types\nof tasks. And at this stage I think it\u0026rsquo;s really about augmentation of\ncapabilities rather than replacement. So as I think we touched on at the\ntop of the talk, it\u0026rsquo;s really about, for me, making people more efficient and\nhelping them to work quicker than it is about entirely replacing job\nfunctions or particular roles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:33\nSo one of the scenarios that I really like with this is to explore. So I think\nthere\u0026rsquo;s two elements. I think there\u0026rsquo;s post incidents to understand the other\nwhat if scenarios, right? So basically XYZ happens so you can go, okay,\nbut we got lucky because they turned right instead of turning left, or they\ndidn\u0026rsquo;t do this and didn\u0026rsquo;t do that. So you can now start to see the next\nsteps. But also I can see that an evolution of that is almost to do this in\nreal time, isn\u0026rsquo;t it, where you almost start to predict what could happen\nnext based on these possible scenarios and then you could even take into\naccount the existing controls of the company so it becomes super\npowerful. So you almost want to start thinking a couple of steps ahead of\nthe attacker, start thinking, are we ready for this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:20\nAre we ready for that? What happens if this happens? So I tend to do that\nincidents, but this will bring a lot of science to that and also will bring you\na lot of more, I would say three dimensions to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 45:31\nYep, yep, absolutely agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:34\nGeorge, I think, has the question. George, just be able to speak. I think\nHugh, I made your co host, although if he\u0026rsquo;s think actually, I think his\nquestion was, yeah, does attack gen work API keys from other genius\nservers as Bar or Bing chat? I think you kind of already said that you\nhaven\u0026rsquo;t really tweaked it for those, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 46:07\nYeah. So it\u0026rsquo;s limited to working with the OpenAI API.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:16\nCool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 46:20\nAnd so, finally, just on identifying use cases, starting small with a well\ndefined use case is really key. So lots of organizations at the moment are\njust experimenting with simple use cases like chat with your security\npolicies. And that\u0026rsquo;s a fairly low risk consequence because people should\nhave a reasonable understanding of security policies anyway. And they\u0026rsquo;ve\nalways got the ability to escalate to a member of the security team if\nthey\u0026rsquo;re not sure about a particular response that they received. And it\u0026rsquo;s\nalso very focused. It\u0026rsquo;s not trying to replace the entire security team as your\nfirst use case. It\u0026rsquo;s nicely scoped and manageable. And that then helps with\nmeeting some of the best practices that we\u0026rsquo;ll come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:15\nOn to now, actually, that\u0026rsquo;s an interesting point. Is it possible to add the\nscenario of what would this, for example, depending on the maturity of the\nsecurity team, what would happen? Because at the moment, you have\nscenario, scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 47:31\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:31\nBut how would you think of how can you add the current controls in\nplace, including the fact that you have a security team that should react to\nsome of these things?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 47:42\nYeah, and that\u0026rsquo;s sort of what I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of with that additional\norganizational context I mentioned in the Roadmap. That\u0026rsquo;s the sort of\ninformation that I would think of, including how capable are your security\nteam? Do you have a permanent security team? Are you using an\noutsourced MSP to perform certain functions or all of your functions? I\nthink those will all have a significant bearing on your ability to respond\nand how you respond to an attack. So it\u0026rsquo;s something that I\u0026rsquo;d like to at\nleast give people the option to factor into some of the scenario\ngenerations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:20\nYeah, that could be actually quite massive, man, because what you would\nalso show is the impact. For example, imagine doing that on budgets,\nright? Imagine doing that on simulations because I guess it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to\nbe perfect, right? But if you have a team of a certain size, let\u0026rsquo;s say you\nhave, let\u0026rsquo;s say, same scenario against three teams. One doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, one\nwith some resources, one with mini resources, one with a lot of resources,\nor one without a lot of outsourcing, one without outsourcing. Right. I\nthink it would be quite interesting to run those scenarios. And again, you\ncan do an LLM on top of the analysis of it, but I think that would be quite\nuseful, especially around budget times and educations. And I guess even if\nyou then start to have actually another valid question here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:06\nDoes this actually have real world scenarios on it? Like real world instead\nof a scenario almost like a real world attack?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 49:17\nSo by virtue of the fact that the attack framework is all about real world\nobserved techniques and tactics that these groups are using, then yes, it\nwon\u0026rsquo;t necessarily replicate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:35\nYeah, but they\u0026rsquo;re not specific. Right? Sorry, they\u0026rsquo;re not specific.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 49:40\nNo, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think two attacks are ever identical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:46\nYeah, but that\u0026rsquo;s an important narrative, especially for in certain sectors,\nbeing funny but personalizing. Some of these, like, look, this attack just\nhappened with this thing with these kind of oil industry or companies. But\nthat could be added, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 50:01\nI\u0026rsquo;d say it\u0026rsquo;s already possible if you go through and do the custom scenario.\nSo if you can get a threat intel report that says for that attack, which were\nthe given techniques, you could build that based off that custom scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:20\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s very powerful, man. Somebody worked a bit on that one and\nshared or find a good way to do it because you then have real world\nscenarios mapped to a particular industry and then you add on top of that,\nfor example, how would the current team or the react or with the impact?\nThat\u0026rsquo;d be really interesting. I guess the foundations are here, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 50:47\nYes. This is only version 0.2 at the moment, so it\u0026rsquo;s still very early days, but\nyeah, just sort of picking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:59\nSarah has a question now. I was literally about to say sorry, I know you\nhad some questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 51:03\nSorry, I can wait. I want to let Matt finish and then I\u0026rsquo;ll pick up at the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 51:07\nYeah, we\u0026rsquo;ve got two slides to go, I think so, won\u0026rsquo;t be too long. So yeah, in\nterms of best practices, we sort of covered small, well defined use cases.\nI\u0026rsquo;d also say non critical use cases to start with. It\u0026rsquo;s really important no\nmatter how compelling the use case. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t start off with a model\nthat\u0026rsquo;s making decisions about people, for example, or things of that\nnature. You really need to build up the organization\u0026rsquo;s familiarity with the\ncapabilities of the tools and where the Foibles are before you start moving\ninto those more potentially risky use cases. And to that end, hewn in the\nloop. Reviews remain absolutely critical at this stage. I have experimented\nwith having sort of pairs of agents working together which does give you\nthat sort of chain of thought process that\u0026rsquo;s been covered in some of the\npapers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 52:11\nBut even then, if you were sending this report off to your CISO to say I\nthink we should do this and you\u0026rsquo;ve not even looked at it, I\u0026rsquo;d be concerned\nif you were doing that. It still needs somebody that understands what the\nmodel should be producing in order to critique it and make sure that it is\nhitting the mark in terms of quality. If you are looking at making decisions\nduring or by using a model, monitoring for bias, using things like that\nLangsmith or another tracing or observability platform is really useful. I\nthink the major LLMs, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google have done a really good\njob at trying to minimize the bias in their models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 53:05\nSome of the smaller models on, for example, Hugging Face, I think they\u0026rsquo;ve\nnot been used and tested enough for us to be clear either way that there\nisn\u0026rsquo;t an inherent bias in the model. So it\u0026rsquo;s important to keep an eye on that\nand also look at just fundamental engineering practices. So this is a\nrelatively new field. We\u0026rsquo;re still experimenting. It\u0026rsquo;s important that you\ndocument what works, what doesn\u0026rsquo;t and track the performance of that\nthroughout the lifecycle of the tools that you\u0026rsquo;re building. I\u0026rsquo;d also say be\ntransparent about your use of AI. I think because we are at that early\nstage, users and even customers are very accepting of the fact that tools\nare experimental. But if they can see the benefits, I think they\u0026rsquo;re prepared\nto accept some variation to what they would get from a pure human to\nhuman interaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 54:11\nThis is a conversation that I\u0026rsquo;m having more often. Again, as the tools move\nfrom POCs into production is really making sure that you\u0026rsquo;re addressing\nthat return on investment point. And so for something like Attack Gen, you\ncould look at metrics such as how many more exercises were you able to\nrun in a year by using something like that tool, as opposed to if you\u0026rsquo;re\nusing a more conventional scenario generation route. And as you get more\nfamiliar with the tools and use them more across more different use cases,\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s easy to become over reliant on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 54:56\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s where things like Human in the Loop reviews being critical of\nthe models and not just accepting what they\u0026rsquo;re telling you is really\nimportant because we\u0026rsquo;ve already seen quite a few well publicized\nexamples of where over reliance has led people down a path that they\nreally didn\u0026rsquo;t want to find themselves on. And lastly, I\u0026rsquo;d say it\u0026rsquo;s still really\nearly days, particularly when it comes to productionizing these apps. And\nso I think it\u0026rsquo;s incredibly important that organizations keep developing\ntheir own internal AI expertise and allow people to experiment, find out\nwhat works and more importantly, what doesn\u0026rsquo;t. That\u0026rsquo;s all really valuable\nexperience that I think we\u0026rsquo;re going to need over the next couple of years.\nAnd so that\u0026rsquo;s everything that I wanted to cover, I think. Sarah, you had a\nquestion. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to take any others that people might have as mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 56:01\nThat was that was brilliant, matt, thank you. It\u0026rsquo;s just so nice to see\nsomething that\u0026rsquo;s so concrete, practical, step by step thought through with\nall the caveats. It\u0026rsquo;s just what I needed right now anyway. But in terms of\nyour model, it did occur to me because I did in a lot of risk articulations\nwhich need a little bit of creativity to make them hit home, especially\nincident scenarios. Would it be forgivable to just plug in the generate\nscenario and ask the model to compare it to any real life incidents that it\ncould pull out? To maybe add some of that color, that sort of newsworthy\ncolor to it just as one idea. I don\u0026rsquo;t actually see a poor impact as long as\nit\u0026rsquo;s true to the mapped out scenario to paint a bit of a picture for\nnontechnical stakeholders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 56:51\nYeah, providing that you\u0026rsquo;re having a human review that and someone\nthat\u0026rsquo;s capable of critiquing the output. I don\u0026rsquo;t see a problem with that. I\nsee it as a way of being more efficient. I think as I\u0026rsquo;ve touched on during\nthe talk where people have got into difficulty is either they\u0026rsquo;ve completely\nrelied on the output and not looked at it. So the case of the lawyer in the\nUS that ended up submitting incorrect case studies with their submission\nsprings to mind immediately. But there are also cases where on a technical\nside you can see things that once you go below the level of really good\ngeneral knowledge, I\u0026rsquo;d say, then you can start to find weaknesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 57:46\nSo if you ask it really technical questions or really up to date questions so\nbeyond the training cut off, the training dates cut off, that\u0026rsquo;s when you\u0026rsquo;ll\nstart to get a lot of hallucinations but in terms of getting work done faster\nbut still maintaining that quality yeah, I absolutely don\u0026rsquo;t see any issue with\nthat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 58:07\nWere you talking about the scenario of taking an existing situation or\nexisting incident and then augmenting with possible scenarios or almost\nlike offshoots of what could have happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 58:19\nPotentially, yeah. Well, either way I was just talking about sort of\npotentially adding some more media friendly color to the attack scenario\nfor if you\u0026rsquo;re bringing potentially doing an executive tabletop or something\nlike that to bring that color to it. That was all. I\u0026rsquo;m guessing you can\nextend it by sort of asking what would happen next, but with all the same\ncaveats that Matt brought to it, that it would need to be credible, it would\nneed to be a logical progression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 58:52\nAnd mean, the only other thing I was going to say is I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m looking at\nwhat you pulled up, Matt, with your Python script to inject the techniques\nin there, because I\u0026rsquo;m looking at scenarios for mapping regulatory and\nlegal compliance requirements across different frameworks where we to\ntry and pull out some duplication and be able to actually have a\nconversation across control objectives and risk areas. To pull out\ncompliance requirements discreetly for types of businesses. So it\u0026rsquo;s a very\nsimilar kind of thing in some ways so that is a good caution for me to take\naway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 59:28\nYeah, and the reason for doing that is because one because to manage the\nrisk of the hallucinations but with a language model that had a really\nlarge context window so like Claude, for example, you could just try\npasting in the entire attack data set with your prompt but that\u0026rsquo;s got a\ncouple of drawbacks really. One is the token cost. So then each input that\nyou submit, each prompt that you submit would contain all of those tokens\nfor the data that you were submitting when actually you only need to\nquery a small subset. You might as well do that upstream before you\nactually use the LLM, you also increase the risk of the hallucination or\nthings not being picked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 01:00:25\nSo some of the research that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen recently is that language models\npay more attention, probably a bit like humans, they pay more attention at\nthe start of a large chunk of text and at the end and then stuff in the\nmiddle tends to get lost. Whereas if you\u0026rsquo;re doing a regulatory framework,\nlookup, you clearly want it to pay attention consistently so that you don\u0026rsquo;t\nmiss relevant clauses that are specific to the query that you\u0026rsquo;re asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 01:00:55\nYeah, I mean, it could contract language as well. There\u0026rsquo;s a potential use\ncase for selectively based on context, putting contract language in based\non the nature of the scenario and triage questions up front. And yeah, you\nreally need that to be paying attention all the way through. That\u0026rsquo;s good\nsteers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 01:01:22\nSo happy to take any more questions otherwise, as I mentioned earlier on,\nthere are the links to my profile on LinkedIn or to my GitHub repo.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a number of different projects in there that use language models in\ndifferent ways. I\u0026rsquo;m really all about practical applications for language\nmodels in cybersecurity and trying to make cybersecurity\u0026rsquo;s professionals\nlives a bit easier through applying these tools. So there\u0026rsquo;s sort of four or\nfive different projects in there that you\u0026rsquo;re welcome to check out and\nthey\u0026rsquo;re all open source cool now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:02:00\nMassive contributions, man. And definitely I think you\u0026rsquo;re going on that\ndirection of augmenting and making is a lot more productive. Right. So I\nfeel the other tools deserve a session too. So let\u0026rsquo;s sync up on that. So\nbrilliant. Thanks for this session and the video will be up quite quickly and\nthen looking forward to the next version of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew Adams - 01:02:25\nThanks very.\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2023/mini-summits/Oct/DevSecOps/","event":"mini-summit","expirydate":-62135596800,"facebook":null,"fuzzywordcount":9100,"hey_summit":"https://www.linkedin.com/events/7117866669871382529","image":null,"job_title":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752075784,"layout":"","linkedin":null,"notes":null,"objectID":"34b10df1b4e5668b648de41f4c26c617","organizers":["Matthew Adams"],"permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/devsecops/attackgen-harnessing-language-models-for-cybersecurity-simulations/","project":"DevSecOps","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":43,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/devsecops/attackgen-harnessing-language-models-for-cybersecurity-simulations/","section":"sessions","status":null,"summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-session\"\u003eAbout this session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an era where cyber threats evolve at an unprecedented pace, traditional methods of incident response testing often fall short.

I think there\u0026rsquo;s a lot\nof things that are related to it and a lot of activities that we can do that\nmake a big difference. So I\u0026rsquo;m Dennis Cruz. I\u0026rsquo;m the chief scientist of glass.\nAll I\u0026rsquo;m also the CEO of Holland Barrett, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s about creating a\nsystem and then everything tends to fall into place with it, but also the\nreaction and the response element of it. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to explore\nmaybe tim, over to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 00:40\nYeah. My name is Danusia Rolewicz and I specialize in human factors, risk\nanalysis and management, and particularly security awareness and culture\nchange. I suppose our whole business is all about trying to take a more\nbehavioral approach to security awareness and move us away from those\ntraditional approaches where really it\u0026rsquo;s just a bit of a tick box exercise,\nbut we can come back to talk about that in a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 01:02\nMy name is Donna Shara Levic and I specialize in human factors, risk\nanalysis and management, and particularly security awareness and culture\nchange. I am contracting at the moment around various organizations to\nimprove security posture and security culture within the organization,\nmost recently Apple. I\u0026rsquo;ve found that there is a shift in the industry at the\nmoment towards more empowering and pathetic approaches towards\nstaff, more employees, staff people rather than users. I think that\u0026rsquo;s having\na really positive effect. I think the more that we focus behaviour change\nand empowerment of staff rather than using that tired, weakest link\nexpression, the further we can get really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 02:03\nCool. All right, so who wants to define what do you mean by behaviour\nchange and awareness?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 02:11\nPikey, do you want to go first and easier?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 02:17\nI think we all know what behaviors we want to change, right? There\u0026rsquo;s a\nlot of talk about click rates, but really when you\u0026rsquo;re looking at behavior\nchange, you are also looking at the behavior and the dynamic within the\ncompany or the organization, like trust dynamics. Rather than focusing on\nthings like click rates, you would try to empower your staff, foster a\nculture of trust within the company, where rather than focusing on the\nclick rate, you focus on the reporting rate. You give the credit and\ncelebrate the wins for those positive outcomes and for those achievements\nthat often fall by the wayside. When you look at a traditional security\naudit and the metrics that go with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 03:08\nI agree with that completely. I think also just going back to your point\nabout there being a shift, I think we\u0026rsquo;ve traditionally done security\nawareness training. It\u0026rsquo;s just been a thing people did partly because they\ngot that there\u0026rsquo;s a human element and we have to help people know how to\ndeal with the threats. Partly just because it became a compliance\ncheckbox. If you step back and think about why you\u0026rsquo;re actually bothering\ndoing it, well, you go back to that kind of famous stat of 80, 90% of tax\nstart with a human. If you actually want to reduce that risk, then\nawareness doesn\u0026rsquo;t reduce the risk. It\u0026rsquo;s just people are aware, great, well\ndone. You\u0026rsquo;ve got to be trying to change behavior. You\u0026rsquo;ve got to be trying\nto build secure habits. It might be just reinforcing habits that are already\ntaking place. I can see Janet just successfully come onto the call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 04:03\nBecause if you really want to reduce risk, then it does come down to\ndifferent behaviors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 04:10\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s right. I can see Jeanette\u0026rsquo;s just successfully come onto the call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Bonar Law - 04:17\nMy sincere apologies. I am technologically incompetent and couldn\u0026rsquo;t find\nthe right setting in zoom. I lived my life in teams, so zoom is not familiar\nto me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 04:34\nJust give me a quick intro, Jeanette, and then give us your views on\nbehavioral change and awareness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Bonar Law - 04:41\nOkay, so I work as a lead specialist in people\u0026rsquo;s cyber risk management at\nthe Coventry Building Society. We take a very broad view of what\nawareness is in the Coventry and we concentrate more on the end, which\nis that our function is to drive down risk through a secure behavior\nchange. In order to do that, we\u0026rsquo;d like to think of ourselves more as human\nhackers. We try to get people to do the things that we want them to do by\nwanting to do them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 05:25\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s a really good point, Janet. I think if you make things easy\nand accessible for people, then you\u0026rsquo;re more likely to get them doing what\nyou want rather than taking a top down approach to controls and\nbehaviors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 05:45\nWe can use science for this, right? Because there\u0026rsquo;s already data that shows\nthat, like you said, the more the users engage, the more you make sense to\nthem, the more their behavior is safe, the better the outcomes, the better\nthe return on investment that we have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 06:03\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s a kind of a self efficacy thing, isn\u0026rsquo;t there? If you kind of help\npeople then get better at things, then you get that kind of positive cycle. I\nmean, I think one of the interesting because once you\u0026rsquo;re talking about\nbehavior, it does make you go to the academic stuff and think about\nbehavioral theories. One of the interesting one is protection motivation\ntheory that has you thinking about how do you make a decision when it\ncomes to dealing with risk. Part of that is around understanding the\nthreat. That\u0026rsquo;s the only bit we\u0026rsquo;ve tended to focus on as awareness\npractitioners in the past. The other bit is the coping, like, do we know\nwhat to do? Can we cope? I think that\u0026rsquo;s the self efficacy bit. If we give\npeople more information of how to cope with the problem. We don\u0026rsquo;t\nnecessarily have to scare them quite so much a bit, maybe, to help them\nunderstand the risk, but we should focus more on the coping, like giving\nthem an easy action to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Bonar Law - 06:58\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 06:58\nAlso on the communication side, I think I\u0026rsquo;m muted. Am I muted? No. Also\non the communication side of things, to really communicate what\u0026rsquo;s in it\nfor them, rather than going in and saying, oh, well, we have this objective,\nwe need to improve our posture by this or that statistic, how will this make\nyour life easier? Why should you be doing this? I think a lot of security\ncommunication, forgets the why and also just the connection with people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 07:40\nWhat I like about the word behavior is because ultimately what we want\nto create is a certain of behaviors in organizations. I\u0026rsquo;m also a big fan of\ntaking incidents like P three S and P four S and elevating them to P ones.\nIn fact, again, I was mentioning that the presentation before this one was\nreally cool because the guy that presented it was showing really good\nexamples of real world incidents who costed like from half a million to\nmultimillion pounds to the companies. He was showing all the things that\nthe attackers did. In a way, when you look at list, you see this is every one\nof them was a failure in behavior in the organization. Something should\nhave detected that there should have been behaviors in the organization\nthat are looking for this. They\u0026rsquo;re paying attention that look for this. I like\nthe word behavior because we can measure that and we can basically say,\nlook, we want the organization to behave in a certain way and we want\nthe organization to behave in ways that then allow us to do X-Y-Z.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 08:38\nWhen you look at the real world data that either backs up or not the\nbehavior that you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 08:45\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s interesting that you\u0026rsquo;re saying a failure in behavior, Dennis,\nbecause like Tim mentioned earlier, the Gartners of the world talk about\n90% of incidents could be attributed to human failure. That I mean,\nhumans are responsible for every point in the chain. It human failure to\ncorrectly configure a system? It human failure to perhaps misunderstand\nthe culture of the organization and impose a policy or a procedure that\u0026rsquo;s\nprobably unrealistic? Or is it the end user inverted comments that failed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 09:37\nYeah, I think it\u0026rsquo;s an interesting one, isn\u0026rsquo;t it, of that kind of risk of getting\ninto that blame, starting to talk about repeat offenders and things like\nthat when it comes to clicking links. I suppose we should recognize that\nwe are giving people computers with email that has links in and half the\ntime we expect them to click them and sometimes we don\u0026rsquo;t. So it needs a\nbit more thought. I suppose I like doing this point around measurability\nbecause I think that is quite important and that\u0026rsquo;s if you are thinking about\nbehavior so old traditional awareness, all you can really measure is have\npeople done it or not? And you get a completion rate. It\u0026rsquo;s like, well, what\ndoes that mean? That doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell you anything. Obviously, measuring\nincidents is far too lagging an indicator. With behaviors, you can do things\nlike that. You can get really observable ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 10:32\nOne of the things we\u0026rsquo;re trying to do with our piece of software red flags is\nto try and actually get right there and measure, well, how often are people\ndoing things like plugging in a USB or uploading files? When you\nintervene, are you seeing that change? There are lots of ways to make this\nmore measurable. As Deniser said earlier, start with reporting rates, not\nnecessarily quick rates, because reporting is a really positive behavior. If\nyou\u0026rsquo;ve got a culture where that\u0026rsquo;s a high number, then you\u0026rsquo;re really onto a\nwinner. If not, start building up that as a focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 11:04\nIf you have a Champions program or thinking of starting one, then there\u0026rsquo;s\nall sorts of things that you can use to join up the dots to the reporting rate.\nHow has this changed? How many people have become involved in\nChampions programs? How many meetings have there been? How many\ntimes have they discussed security with their team? Join up the dots of all\nof those metrics and you can get an idea of why there\u0026rsquo;s been a change in\nreporting rates, for example, or other measurable behaviors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Bonar Law - 11:44\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a really good point. This idea that we have incidents because of\nsome kind of single point of failure and this hideous metaphor, which I\nloathe about being the weakest link. Humans are the weakest link. Well,\nthat\u0026rsquo;s not true. Humans exist in a whole ecosystem of vulnerabilities, some\nof which are behavioral, some of which are technical, some of which are\ncultural. It just so happens that in a particular incident, one step, because\nit is never a single point of failure, one set of events happened which\nhighlighted weaknesses in the ecosystem. And we need to recognize that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 12:32\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s a really good point, Jeanette. I think just saying the word\nweakest link or failure or whatever equivalent thereof, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t send the\nright message to the rest of the organization. Why would anyone want to\nthink of themselves negatively? You would never engage anyone by telling\nthem a negative thing about themselves. If we have that behavior\nourselves, of using language like that within our team, then how likely is it\nthat\u0026rsquo;s going to be perpetuated? We\u0026rsquo;re going to spread that message\nconsciously or unconsciously through the organization and create apathy,\nreally like, do we want to motivate or demotivate? Really discourage\nlanguage is so powerful in that, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 13:27\nI think I could be a little controversial. I would say that 99%, if not 95% of\nwhat we call human error are system errors, right? We put the human in a\nplace that it can create a huge amount of problems in a way that you\ndon\u0026rsquo;t understand the side effects. So that\u0026rsquo;s a system error, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 13:52\nI was going to say one of the quite important things when you start to take\na behavioral approach is to think about what you\u0026rsquo;re going to do with that.\nBecause you could take a behavioral I mean, phishing simulations\narguably are a behavioral approach, but they have a tendency to then\nresult in a bit of a stick that says you failed, we\u0026rsquo;re going to tell you off,\nthing. What you need to be doing is thinking about what that data can tell\nyou. To your point, Dennis, it can tell you that your business process is\nputting people in a position where the only way they can meet the deadline\nthe boss is set is I know, Gmail, and send something to their Gmail account\nat home. The behavioral data can give you really interesting insights. It\ndoes take a bit of a mental shift, I suppose, to think about what are you\ngoing to do with that information?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 14:36\nHow are you going to take a more behavioral approach so that it just\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t become a consequences culture where you\u0026rsquo;re just telling people off\nwhen they do things wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 14:44\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s about what question you\u0026rsquo;re asking, right? For me, I always\nthink that the users should have common sense, right? They should really\nunderstand how to report things that they observe that are a bit weird and\nthey should be rewarded by positive behavior, right? It means that in a\nway, you want over reporting, right? Because in an interesting way, over\nreporting is a side effect of your users actually thinking, oh, this is a bit\nweird. Oh, this is not very good. Right in the middle of it, there should be\nthe real scenarios, but also it gives you good data. It allows you to\nunderstand, are you an organization that has a huge amount of problem\nwith that kind of activities, or which division of your organization has lots\nof problems with phishing or abuse and what other divisions don\u0026rsquo;t have,\nright? You can look it again at the incidents or the practices and see what\ndo we have in place to prevent that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 15:42\nI feel that again, I like the behavior because behavior allows us to look at\nincidents and going, why didn\u0026rsquo;t we detect this here instead of there, right?\nWho saw this in all the activities and didn\u0026rsquo;t raise an alarm bell that\nsuddenly you only got raise an alarm bell because XYZ had happened,\nright? You can think about what technology you put in place and what\nsolutions you put in place so that in a way, when something happens, you\nhave immediate understanding and reaction about it because the user\nclicks on a link, the user doing an action, a stressed engineer doing\nsomething that makes a mistake. It\u0026rsquo;s not at fault. We put the engineers in\nthat location, right? We put users in that environment. They not at fault,\nright. They\u0026rsquo;re just behaving if anything, we should be celebrating the other\n99% of the times that they saved, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 16:38\nRight. It\u0026rsquo;s we have this thing where we force the users to drive a car down\nthe mountain, right, with no rail guards at a crazy speed, and then we\ncomplain about the ones that fell over, right? Actually, actually you should\nbe celebrating the ones that made it true. Right. Because we gave them a\nreally dangerous environment to operate in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 16:59\nIt does raise some interesting questions about how you think about\nsecurity. You can have that traditional approach. Well, everything\u0026rsquo;s going\nto be really secure if you lock everything down and control it. That\u0026rsquo;s\nperhaps quite an old fashioned approach to security, but that was the way\nthings work. We can lock everything down, it\u0026rsquo;ll be fine. Turn off the\nInternet, we\u0026rsquo;ll all be secure. Actually, if you\u0026rsquo;re starting to understand\nbehaviors at the level you\u0026rsquo;re talking about Dennis, then you can start to\ngo, well, actually, these people over here, the way that they work, they\ncould actually have more human based controls. They don\u0026rsquo;t need to be\nlocked down. We could just help them behaviorally and therefore your\nwhole business could work. It could access these tools that will add to\ncreativity rather than being that we\u0026rsquo;re a bank, therefore we turn off the\ninternet. We turn off everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 17:45\nThey can\u0026rsquo;t do their home stuff, they can\u0026rsquo;t plug in USBs. Obviously that\u0026rsquo;s\ngoing to have an impact on an organization getting talent to some degree.\nI think you can create quite an interesting kind of trade off and say, well,\nlook, can we take a more behavioral approach? I think that\u0026rsquo;s going to be\nhard for security. Some security professionals will find that kind of, well,\nhold on with this control. This is really black and white. It\u0026rsquo;s really binary.\nThey can either do it or they can\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 18:08\nI think you need to work first. I think you need to add behavior and risk to\nit because they are very connected, right. It also you need to take into\naccount the threat agents and in a way the regulatory compliance that you\nmight exist. Right. But the threats are important. The threat agent is very\nimportant because the threat agent determines the level of risk that you\nhave. If you\u0026rsquo;re an environment that has highly sophisticated, super\nefficient, like they can act crazy fast, then yes, you probably need to have\nmore security controls in place. Majority organizations, that\u0026rsquo;s not where\nwe are, right? Majority organizations is criminals, is vigilantes, people\nwho disgruntled employees, even the users. Right. The biggest attacker\nwhen you track this properly that the company has is the company itself.\nWe just don\u0026rsquo;t call them cybersecurity incidents. Right, but the company\nitself will cause a lot of damage to itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 19:04\nYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 19:06\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s all behavior. Right. It\u0026rsquo;s all behavior because we put users in\nplaces that they can make a lot of those mistakes. And it\u0026rsquo;s not even\nmistakes. It\u0026rsquo;s almost a margin of error. Right. If you force a team to\noperate at a certain level of conditions, you will have, say, they operate\nwell 90% of the time, okay, there\u0026rsquo;s going to be 1% mistakes. That\u0026rsquo;s it. You\nhave to assume that is just almost the cost of that environment that you\nset up in place. Right. That your behavior there determines and your risk\nappetite determines what that percentage is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 19:38\nRight, absolutely. I mean, I\u0026rsquo;d be interested in kind of Janet in your kind of\nworld of commentary, kind of how you go about taking a behavioral\napproach. It about just walking through the risk register and saying,\nwhat\u0026rsquo;s the behavioral perspective of all of these things? Where do you\nstart?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Bonar Law - 19:58\nIt\u0026rsquo;s interesting, isn\u0026rsquo;t it, that Dennis mentioned how risk and response to\nthreats varies across various pieces of an organization. For that very\nreason, in the Coventry, we\u0026rsquo;re moving to a more functionally aligned\npattern of delivering security awareness for wanting a better word so that\nparticularly high risk functions such as finance and the people team will\nhave a dedicated awareness specialist who becomes almost part of the\ntribe. So it\u0026rsquo;s like being a cultural anthropologist. You go in and you find\nout how people are working and what it is they need to be doing and what\nsupport we can put in to take away as much of the pain points as possible\nin process and technology and then whatever remains the residual risk we\naddress through dialogue and behavior change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 21:06\nYeah, it\u0026rsquo;s interesting because I think it does make you have to think and\ntake a slightly different approach because for example, if you want good\nbehaviors around passwords, then you could obviously be and obviously\nwe focus quite a lot on nudging, but you could be intervening nudging,\nsaying stuff around passwords. What are you going to tell them to do\ninstead? If you haven\u0026rsquo;t got a good thing like an action you want them to\ndo, like you haven\u0026rsquo;t got a password tool or a way of storing them, then\nwhat are you nudging towards? It\u0026rsquo;s much easier to nudge towards a good\nbehavior than just say, don\u0026rsquo;t do that, without giving any guidance, well,\nwhat do you want me to do? It changes the way you have to think about\nthings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Bonar Law - 21:48\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s interesting you talk about passwords because we have a\nparticularly horrible password policy, which is super complex and no\npassword manager to assist with that at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:03\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a good example of bad security. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Bonar Law - 22:06\nMakes no sense. We have nothing to help. We have instead of a helpful\npassword manager, we have a super strict password policy that if your\npassword on audit quarterly is found not to be secure, you go on a very\nserious naughty list and miss disciplinary action. That is shocking and that\nneeds to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:34\nI was in a very interesting meeting where I was saying that we should\nweaken our password policy if they had MFA. I was saying if you have\nMFA, then in a current setting environment we should have long password\nexpiration dates and we should allow for weaker passwords compared to\nfreaking crazy stuff, right? I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that you allow password one,\nbut I\u0026rsquo;m saying that it\u0026rsquo;s about saying the single most important thing to do\nin passwords today is multifactorification MFA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 23:07\nThat\u0026rsquo;s like, how are you introducing MFA? How are you facilitating them\nto get on board with MFA? Because I was in a bank environment in\nanother country and the procedure for customers to download the app\nand go through all of the motions to get that meant that I heard at least\ntwo different conversations where a customer had come in. It was quite\nopen concept layout as well, on top of everything in the bank. I could hear\ntwo different people getting help from a clerk on how to set up their MFA,\nbut in such a way that they were exposing data to anyone that could hear\neven a temporary password that the clerk suggested to them was\neverything was audible. You can have this really amazing secure app, but\nif people are going to find these workarounds and not be able to get on\nboard and to download it and to get onto it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 24:19\nThen it\u0026rsquo;s worth not usable. Absolutely right. That scales more, right, in a\nway which actually takes to a point where you could only have behavior if\nit\u0026rsquo;s usable. That\u0026rsquo;s what I like about, again, the word behavior because\nyou\u0026rsquo;ve all seen that picture of what\u0026rsquo;s it called the gate, right? All the cars\ngo around it, right? Because in a way to go around it, again, I like\nbehavior because behavior you can answer why are we trying to do this?\nRight? Why we\u0026rsquo;re trying to do this to protect the users. Actually, again,\nthere\u0026rsquo;s data that shows that sometimes if you make it more secure, it\nactually becomes less safe because people will you actually push users\naway. That\u0026rsquo;s why I always talk about safety versus security. When I\npresented the boards, I said my job here is not to make to not to have\nincidents and not to be secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 25:18\nOur job is to be safe. And that\u0026rsquo;s very different. Right. Going back, Tim, to\nyour point, you can make a great secure system that\u0026rsquo;s connected to\nanything, right? It might be very secure, but it\u0026rsquo;s not very usable and it\u0026rsquo;s\nnot very safe. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t meet the risk profile of the organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 25:35\nYour definition of safe is kind of secure and usable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 25:39\nWell, I would say it\u0026rsquo;s aligned to the business risk appetite. Right. There\u0026rsquo;s a\nbalance, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 25:44\nAppropriate security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 25:47\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the irony, right? If you live in a place where you have to have a\nhouse with 25 locks and a machine gun and a guard outside, I can argue\nthat house has a lot of security. Right? There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of security features on\nit. Right. But which one is safer? That one or a house that you can leave\nyour door unlocked? Now remember that you can only leave your door\nunlocked if you\u0026rsquo;re in an environment, in a neighborhood that is safe. And\nwhy is safe? Because there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of other things that will do that from the\ngeographical location, from the neighbors. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of other things\nthat come into play, right, to allow you to leave your door unlocked and\nalso the kind of attackers you have there. I think you have to balance who\nis attacking you, what\u0026rsquo;s your requirements, why are you doing stuff, what\nassets you have that should determine the security and the implications of\na compromise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 26:39\nClearly, if I have a pile of medical data and the pile of data is not really\nrelevant, the security requirements should be very different. Even the\ndefinition of safety is very different from one to the other. Again, context\nand behavior matters, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 26:57\nYeah. I think arguably some of that is taking that risk based approach,\nisn\u0026rsquo;t it? Because even in ignoring behavior, I\u0026rsquo;ve been in organizations\nwhere they\u0026rsquo;ve just had these well, if it\u0026rsquo;s got data, it\u0026rsquo;s got to be encrypted.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re like, well, no, what\u0026rsquo;s the threat? Like, what different data has\ndifferent kind of requirements? The saying comes down to where people\nare involved, I suppose, is just thinking about what\u0026rsquo;s the risk profile and\nwhat behaviors are the ones that we want to see. You get into the whole\nworld of, okay, and then how do you get those behaviors? How do you\nhelp change and steer people to work in those ways?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 27:39\nCan we now then move to the second word, which I really like, or third\nactually, which is awareness. And I would just throw this. I think\nawareness by the users is also crazy important. Sometimes we try to get\nawareness by scaring, which is not always the right way to do it. I think\nonce the users understand what they\u0026rsquo;re dealing with, they actually tend to\nbe very protective and they actually tend to do the right thing in how they\noperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 28:09\nYeah, I suppose we quite often go back to BJ Fogg\u0026rsquo;s model in this because\nfrom a behavior perspective and that has in it that element of motivation.\nBJ Fox says that any behavior has got a bit of motivation, a bit of ability,\nbut also some prompt or trigger to act and obviously the tools around you\ngive you the ability bit and your knowledge. Also you\u0026rsquo;ve got to have that\nmotivation and some of that I think comes from the awareness you\u0026rsquo;re\ntalking about, didn\u0026rsquo;t it? You\u0026rsquo;ve got to help people understand that yes, this\nis a threat and that it\u0026rsquo;s relevant because if they don\u0026rsquo;t have that motivation\nthey\u0026rsquo;re not going to necessarily act. Slightly counter that you\u0026rsquo;ve also got\nto expect that quite often people aren\u0026rsquo;t going to act securely because\nthey\u0026rsquo;re busy, they\u0026rsquo;ve got other things to do. Therefore when it comes\nbehaviour change and want to work as hard as you can to make the\neasiest behavior the one you want and that\u0026rsquo;s a great example when it\ncomes to passwords, how hard are you going to make?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 29:15\nYeah, and equally I think going back to what you were saying Dennis,\nabout scaring them, I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s ever really the right way. Fear,\nuncertainty, doubt, FUD or EPPM, these are strategies that we can see\nbeing exploited historically in marketing or by social engineers. Really,\nwhy not focus more on the positive empowerment? We\u0026rsquo;re pre programmed\nto react to positive prompts more. Again, creating security messaging,\ncreating programs where we can talk and involve people and give them a\nfeeling of shared responsibility because it\u0026rsquo;s their choice to get involved.\nOnce they have the buy in of being involved in for example, a Champions\nprogram, then that buy in, that investment that they\u0026rsquo;ve made, they\u0026rsquo;re not\njust going to throw that away, that\u0026rsquo;s going to be used much more\npowerfully. I think something that Tim often talks about is social force.\nOnce you recruit a few people and they start talking about something and\nwhat they\u0026rsquo;re getting out of it, like how they\u0026rsquo;re benefiting and growing,\nthen other people will want to join immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 30:43\nYeah, social proof can really be a great helpful thing to bring any behavior\nand you can kind of do things like say well, so and so has reported this,\nhave you reported anything when it comes to fishing? You\u0026rsquo;re just even in a\nsimple behavior you can kind of frame it like that. We\u0026rsquo;re all social animals\nso we want to be helping socially, we want to be seen to be doing what\nother people do. There\u0026rsquo;s other cognitive bus like reciprocity which is kind\nof similar where you can well, the security team have done all of this work\nblocking this stuff, we\u0026rsquo;ve given you this, we block this much, could you do\nyour bit? People kind of feel like they ought to give back a bit? Probably\ndepends how you word that slightly but there\u0026rsquo;s some useful ways that you\ncan kind of encourage those behaviors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 31:34\nAs a Google strategy, which I just want to prefix that I\u0026rsquo;ve also seen a very\ninteresting. Paradox that when you have a supply chain that goes from\nvery small individuals to very large companies, you actually tend to have a\nweird situation where the ones that are most secure are, I would say, the\nlarge companies that have already regulation, compliance, bigger teams\nwho actually are able to take security a lot more seriously. Right, not more\nseriously. They actually have very color resources and they understand\nbetter. Also the smaller companies tend to have that because they\nunderstand the problems and the side effects of cybersecurity in their\nworld. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s the one in the middle that tend to be the worst ones\nwho tend to actually fall into you want to give us your question? Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 32:24\nBasically, from what Dennis was saying about the appetite for security,\nwhere a company might have all they might have a situation where they\nfeel that they\u0026rsquo;re secure enough, but they might think that they have this\nfalse sense of security mindset where they believe that they\u0026rsquo;re too small to\nbe targeted, which in essence is like for a lot of people that might go after\ncybercriminals, they prey on those, but they just don\u0026rsquo;t realize that. It\u0026rsquo;s just\nhard to really get them in that mindset that, hey, actually you should be\ntaking things more seriously. And here\u0026rsquo;s why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 33:27\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a good point, Billy, and it goes back to that awareness point Dennis\nwas making, that there is a bit of need to help people understand the\nthreat and possibly of highlighting the risk. Not too much fear, but\nbecause just to help people understand that they might not even being\ntargeted, but they\u0026rsquo;re going to be collateral damage, potentially. Quite\noften the way that attacks work is that they\u0026rsquo;re not targeting anyone,\nthey\u0026rsquo;re targeting just general weaknesses. They\u0026rsquo;ll be firing this out across\nthousands of kind of endpoints or people. If your small business hasn\u0026rsquo;t got\nsome of the basics right, you\u0026rsquo;re not the target, but you\u0026rsquo;ve become the\ntarget because you had a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Bonar Law - 34:18\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 34:18\nEspecially with this at ransomware as a service model and the outsourcing\ninvolved in that anyone could be targeted just because why not? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t\ntake very much, really effort on the part of the attacker, but.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 34:37\nI would follow the assets. If you go back again to behavior change, one of\nthe places where you can see huge amount of policy behavior is on the\nthird party supply chain where you start to see pressures from the more\nmature companies downwards to do the right thing. To be honest, that is\ncorrect because ultimately it\u0026rsquo;s about understanding that you might be a\ncompany that has quite large, but you depend on a chain of suppliers that\nif they are compromised down here, that is going to affect you. Also that\u0026rsquo;s\nan awareness for the company because the company might think, well, we\nare a small provider who would attack us. If they are aware, going back\nto the second thought of the word, right, if they\u0026rsquo;re aware that they can\nactually cause a huge amount of damage and the asset or whatever\nthey\u0026rsquo;re providing is actually a mission critical element of a bigger\ncompany, then they need to take it where?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 35:27\nAgain, I think it\u0026rsquo;s that behavior that you can also drive by creating\neconomic models or social models. Because again, you talk about security\nchampions, but it\u0026rsquo;s also to do with the companies who hold key elements\nof the supply chain. You can push security downstream and also allow\ngood investment in security. Going to Billy\u0026rsquo;s point or why should we do it?\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the value for us? Well, guess what? If companies also can get\nrewarded in the marketplace for having good security practices, for\nhaving good security investment, which there\u0026rsquo;s a direct correlation\nactually between security investment and good engineering, right, and\ngood practices. Because most of the stuff that we want to do is common\nsense, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 36:09\nGood governance is quite often means yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:13\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a direct correlation even on potential due diligence. I always tell\nthe companies I work for get us involved in due diligence because we\u0026rsquo;ll\nlower the price, right? Because of acquisitions, because security is a great\nway to do due diligence. Because you ask really good questions about how\nthings work, not that they work, it\u0026rsquo;s about what actually is happening\nunder the hood. A good company, when you ask how things operate,\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t go to the whiteboard and start drawing it, right? That\u0026rsquo;s crazy.\nImmaturity right. They should know how things behave. Right. I think that\nbehavior is super critical across organization. I know who mentioned that\nwe hacked the organization, but that\u0026rsquo;s how I think about this. We\u0026rsquo;re trying\nto find the ways to nudge the organization, to behave in the ways that is\non their own interest, to be safe and more efficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 37:04\nYeah, I mean, that\u0026rsquo;s an interesting kind of much higher macro level\nversion of the behavior, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? It\u0026rsquo;s the regulatory environment that the\nkind of the market can provide to steer people. Obviously people like\nNCSC have been trying to do that with things like cyber essentials, haven\u0026rsquo;t\nthey? They\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to create a framework where, well, okay. Now\nyou do get, I mean, as a supplier, you get asked, have you got these\ndifferent frameworks? And that has a positive impact. I suppose there\u0026rsquo;s\nthen an interesting debate about where regardless of all these\nframeworks, where behavior becomes that entry point where people can\nstill do something that breaks the whole bottle. How are you going to help\nthose people? How are you going to help the individuals within those\norganizations as well to behave?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:56\nWell, that\u0026rsquo;s why I think we should be measuring behavior, right? Because\nbehavior, again, driven by incidents, is real. It\u0026rsquo;s not theoretical. Basically,\nwhen something occurs let\u0026rsquo;s take Phishing as an example, right? If a\ncompany is targeting with phishing, what happens? Do people click on\nthings and then hide it? Do people click on things and then report it? Do\npeople don\u0026rsquo;t click on things? Right? What\u0026rsquo;s the behavior that you want\nfrom a security team? From my point of view, yes, it\u0026rsquo;s better if they don\u0026rsquo;t\nclick, but they\u0026rsquo;re going to click on things, right? I much prefer somebody\nwho\u0026rsquo;s comfortable enough to go to the security team and give us advanced\nwarning that something just happened than somebody clicking, going, oh,\nI hope nothing went wrong, and then not give us advanced warning. We\nactually had an incident that was like that. We actually went back to users\nand says, look, the problem is not you did XYZ, the problem is you didn\u0026rsquo;t\ntell us that you just did that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:55\nThe fact that you did this, the fact that you went to a website and entered\nyour credentials, for example, we would have done that. I cannot look a\nuser in the eye and says you had fault when members of my team probably\ncould have fault for the same thing, right? It looked just like the real stuff\nwas very authentic. You cannot expect users not to fall for that. Once they\nnotice that something was weird, what they should have done is tell us\nstraight away because then we can make sure that the users of that\npassword is not problematic. Again, what\u0026rsquo;s the behavior you want the\nusers do you want the users not to click on things and they want the users\nto tell you and to be the your eyes and ears on the ground that stuff is\nhappening. I prefer the second one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 39:42\nYeah, we talked about it earlier, didn\u0026rsquo;t we? This idea of understanding\nwhat are the behaviors you want to see in your organization, then thinking\nabout how you can measure them. I think there\u0026rsquo;s of just thinking about\nwhat are you going to do with that? That you don\u0026rsquo;t become so we try our\nhardest to try and intervene with behaviors before or as they\u0026rsquo;re\nhappening, or we use the behavioral psychology of ideas of like priming\nand things to steer people before the event. I think there are obviously\ntools out there that are looking at kind of post instant and post event and\nbehavior. There\u0026rsquo;s just a worry in my head there that then you get into this\ncycle of punishment with training where you\u0026rsquo;re trying to change the\nbehavior by going, we spotted that you did this thing, now we\u0026rsquo;re going to\ncome. However hard you try, I think it\u0026rsquo;s quite hard for that not to be seen\nas telling someone off and trying to correct their behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 40:39\nWhereas I think if you can try and do it before or as it can be a bit more\nlooks like this might be about to happen. Are you sure you don\u0026rsquo;t want to\ndo it this way and you can try and be a bit more back to January, bit more\ngentle, a bit more supportive, empathic and help people. I suppose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 40:58\nEven in the post click scenario I think it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be about training.\nIt could just be a discussion starting off a dialogue that actually could go\ninto a security champion session or some situation where you could not\nexpose that person but use their experience to understand the triggers and\nthe context that are floating around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Bonar Law - 41:37\nI would argue that in the post click situation that is possibly the worst time\nyou could choose to try and deliver any kind of training because they\u0026rsquo;ve\njust clicked on the email, they\u0026rsquo;re annoyed that they\u0026rsquo;re being caught out\nand they\u0026rsquo;re quite upset about it and that is not a good receptive base for\nnew information. I would argue it\u0026rsquo;s next to pointless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 42:06\nI completely agree. We should be thanking them. The other thing is\ntraining should be in context to what their day job is. Then it makes sense,\nright? Or else it doesn\u0026rsquo;t again doesn\u0026rsquo;t secure. Billy, I had a follow up\nquestion. Do you want to yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 42:22\nBasically, I spent of time as a truck driver. One of the things one of the\ncompanies did was when went to pick up our load, we would have to do\nour pre trip inspection. Sometimes they would hide gift cards in places\nwhere we need to look for our inspection. Like $10 at the local coffee shop\nkind of a thing. Just as a reward for doing your job. Of course if you don\u0026rsquo;t\ndo it properly then well, you lose out. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking you could do the same\nthing in the office space for some things like for instance setting it up in\nthe office where a policy where if you have a suspicious email send it to\n\u003ca href=\"mailto:suspicious@thecompanyname.com\"\u003esuspicious@thecompanyname.com\u003c/a\u003e and then it will look at it, analyze it,\nsee if it is and then maybe give that person reward. Like hey, you protected\nthe company by reporting this suspicious email.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 43:53\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a gift card for Amazon or something along those lines. Maybe if\nsomeone at the end of the year, if someone gets whoever gets the most\nmaybe gets some kind of a reward or something like that, just like a\nrecognition for doing that. I think that could put people in a proactive\ndisposition where they\u0026rsquo;re more looking for these so they can report them.\nOtherwise it\u0026rsquo;s just like they just don\u0026rsquo;t really care about them. Even if they\ndo see them as suspicious they might just ignore them or whatever. This\nway they\u0026rsquo;re being proactive and I think that would inspire others to do the\nsame when they see people actually getting rewarded for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:42\nAbsolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 44:43\nI love the suspicious atcompanyname.com address. That\u0026rsquo;s amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Bonar Law - 44:49\nI am going to steal that immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 44:53\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of things that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen around in different organizations of\ngamifying security. One thing is like a Pokemon Go kind of approach to\nreporting or flagging issues, which it depends on the type of\norganizational culture that you\u0026rsquo;re looking at because it might not be\nappropriate for everybody, but I think what you\u0026rsquo;re saying could fit in quite\nnicely on that gamification shelf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 45:24\nYeah, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it done quite well with fishing where it\u0026rsquo;s less about tricking\nand catching out and it\u0026rsquo;s more about saying, right, we\u0026rsquo;re going to run a\nphishing competition. It\u0026rsquo;s going to start really easy and then it\u0026rsquo;s going to\nget really hard and the people who get through to the kind of spot, the last\nmost difficult email will win a prize or something. You\u0026rsquo;ve changed it,\nyou\u0026rsquo;ve turned it on its head, you\u0026rsquo;ve made the whole thing quite fun and\ninteresting and people step. The only slight issue is the self selection of\npeople who are already probably the ones who don\u0026rsquo;t need to know the\ntrading. You have to think about what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to achieve, but it gets\npeople liking and talking about security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:03\nTim, you tell my question, because the question I was going to ask you is\nthat when you do a phishing campaign exercise, do you tell the users and\nthe It team or not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 46:14\nSo we don\u0026rsquo;t tend to do them. We think that there are other ways to tackle\nthis, but I think it all comes down to what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to achieve with it.\nBecause the reason we don\u0026rsquo;t use I don\u0026rsquo;t think the click rate is so variable\ndepending on the bait, that you have to think like, why are you doing this?\nWhat are you trying to achieve? I don\u0026rsquo;t think the training afterwards is\nthat effective, as Janet says. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of, why are you even doing these\nthings? Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s useful to understand the difference between different\nsectors of your organization, like who\u0026rsquo;s most prone to authority based\ntype attacks, in which case, no, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t tell them because you are\ntrying to get some useful insightful data which you can then use. I don\u0026rsquo;t\nknow, janet, do you tell people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Bonar Law - 47:05\nI don\u0026rsquo;t tell anybody. I just set the campaign up, let it know that the box is\ngoing to be busy and hit the Go button. Really? That\u0026rsquo;s what I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 47:17\nStand back. Like the blue touch paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 47:22\nThere was one organization that I was at where people were actively\nrequesting phishing campaigns that was an indication of and it was\nspecific teams as well. I think that ties into what Tim was saying, how you\nmight get a group that really goes for that thing and that really wants to\nprove themselves and then maybe the other groups or teams within the\norganization, something else could work. Maybe developing a tailored\napproach where not everybody gets hit with the same thing or the same\nstrategy could be useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:05\nYeah. Let me share a couple of things here. Because I think this is on a\ntopic, maybe some of you guys are already aware of this, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s\nquite cool. Can you see my screen? Do about the knife and framework?\nHave you heard of this framework?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Bonar Law - 48:20\nNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:22\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard about this is pretty awesome. The other one is Worthy\nMaps, which we\u0026rsquo;ve done a lot of sessions, but I think for this one, it\u0026rsquo;s a\nreally good behavioral framework created by Dave Snowden that breaks\nthe world into this different worlds. It\u0026rsquo;s very interesting to understand\nwhere you are and what behaviour change and to see in each of these. It\u0026rsquo;s\na really good way of thinking about how people will react, how systems\nwill react, how almost like trying to get an understanding of the behavior\nthat you see is almost a consequence of the environment that exists. But\nthe environment evolves, right? The evolvement goes from chaotic to\ncomplex to complicated and simple. Also each of these has certain\nresilience. A simple, for example, you might think is what you want, but\nactually a simple could be a monoculture. There\u0026rsquo;s one thing that happens,\neverybody does it, which then is very successful to massive disruption\nbecause if that thing stops working, everything so you actually sometimes\nfall from simple to chaotic because things can occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:24\nThis is quite interesting again how you respond, like you act sense,\nrespond here, you probe sense and respond. So it\u0026rsquo;s quite cool. Again, I\u0026rsquo;ll\nput the links in there and there\u0026rsquo;s some really interesting stuff about the\nframework, how you behave, et cetera. I definitely recommend you guys to\nsee this in the presentation. And then the other one is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 49:46\nYeah, looks really interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:48\nYeah. The other one, I see this recently, but have you heard about this one\nby this guy Nicholas Means, who talk about the My Line incident. It\u0026rsquo;s a\ngreat story about how this was a nuclear incident occurred in US. How\nyou can look at this from two different angles completely. One is kind of\nwhat happened in hindsight, almost looking for what went wrong, but\nthen you can have another view. We does it the second part, which is what\nwas the behavior that you would expect the individuals and that moment\nin time with that background, with that experience, with that stuff, to\nrespond. You see they actually did what you would expect them to do,\nright? Of course, in hindsight you go why do you turn that valve along?\nWhy do you do this, why do you do that? You would make in how those\nindividuals were thinking, how they got brought up to their experience,\nwhat the signals they see, even the design of the place where you have all\nthe alarms that was badly designed, had really bad usability, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:49\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a great example of you say why did you miss the alarm? Okay, but if\nthe alarm is on a table with 30 other freaking LEDs and things, and the\nmission critical flashing light is next to the splashing light that the elevator\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t work. Well, clearly that\u0026rsquo;s a problem. Right. From a Usability point\nof view, and there are tons of others. Right. I think these are really cool\nexamples on behavior, that it\u0026rsquo;s about thinking about the environment that\nyou create that then leads to the behavior of the individuals, which is,\nagain, why I think if we can measure the behavior, you can sometimes\neven predict the behavior because you know that the ecosystem will occur\non this in this good kind of environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Bonar Law - 51:37\nI think you touched on a really powerful thing there about the power of\nstories and connecting with an audience instead of just giving the facts. If\nyou can weave the facts into a compelling story, the narrative kind of\ncarries it into the brain. Remember stories better than remember list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 52:01\nAbsolutely. The story is critical. Yeah. Simon Worley on the worldly maps.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t seen the sessions on Worldly Maps on the Summit, just\nsearch the Summit website. There\u0026rsquo;s some amazing sessions there, right?\nYeah. Simon Worley talks about how you want maps and how maps give\nyou context, allowed to understand things, allowed to create a story about\nwhat happens, a narrative that then you then remember. Cool. Well, we\nwant to talk about the hour. This is a really good session. We need to do\nmore of this. I love this session. Definitely what the semi is all about. Any\nfinal words? Let me just go around the table. Any final words?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 52:42\nYeah, I just think definitely I\u0026rsquo;ve got a few recommendations that I\u0026rsquo;m\nputting in the chat as you were showing us those great resources. I\u0026rsquo;m just\ntrying to it\u0026rsquo;s not really working very well, but yeah, just try to understand\nyour main audience, try to key into their needs, understand their\nbehaviour change and empathetic route, and try to marry that bottom up\napproach with your top down compliance needs. If you take that route,\nthen you\u0026rsquo;ll see more positive impact and behavior change than the\ncompliance focused approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 53:31\nTim?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 53:33\nYeah, I suppose I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about this idea of kind of thinking a bit\ndifferently about security awareness and thinking about the behaviors that\nyou want to see and then work out how you create a choice architecture, I\nsuppose, where you make it easy for people to do the secure behavior. Our\napproach would tend to be to try and as you said, Dennis, measure things\nbaseline, see what behaviors are taking place. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve understood\nthat, start thinking about how you\u0026rsquo;re going to steer people in the right\ndirection. We would talk about trying to do that as in real time as you\npossibly can. So you\u0026rsquo;re steering the right behaviors. I\u0026rsquo;ll put some links.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve got lots of behavioral science articles and awareness articles on our\nblog, so I can share that as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:19\nYeah. Also send it to Alana because we can add it to the page. Right. Once\nwe put the video there, we put it there. That would be really cool. Jeanette,\nany final words?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJanet Bonar Law - 54:30\nYeah, I think in the past, awareness has sometimes been seen as a\nbroadcast activity, that we have the information and we broadcast it to\neverybody. Because everybody needs to know the same thing, we deliver it\nin the same way. Clearly we now understand that\u0026rsquo;s not the case. It\u0026rsquo;s not a\nbroadcast activity at all. It\u0026rsquo;s a very interactive fiber anthropology exercise\nin trying to understand your audience and their needs and fit in your\ncommunications to shape their behaviors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 55:08\nYeah, couldn\u0026rsquo;t agree more. Good stuff. Oh, sorry. Finish any final? You\nlook like you\u0026rsquo;re going to chip in with a final comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanusia Rolewicz - 55:17\nNo, I just managed to send my message, that\u0026rsquo;s all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 55:22\nYeah. The other one that\u0026rsquo;s really powerful is the checklist, if you see in the\nbook. What I really liked about that one was the idea that you don\u0026rsquo;t create\na checklist for everything you want to do. You create a checklist to\nactually nudge the behaviors and the things that people miss. Right. It\u0026rsquo;s\nlike, think about a pilot has a checklist, doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a checklist.\nEverything they want to do is almost a checklist of either the things they\nforget to do or to miss or the things that would trigger other behaviors\nthat will then get you to do the right in. Right. Again, the way you design\nthat system makes a big difference. So again, we can end on that. So\nthank you very much. This was a really cool session, and I\u0026rsquo;ll see you\naround in the other session of the summit. Let\u0026rsquo;s do come up with another\nsession for the next summit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 56:04\nThis is really good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 56:06\nThank you very much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 56:07\nGood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 56:07\nSee.

And right on point on where we are, I think on the evolution of AI and gen AI we have. James is going to talk about a topic that actually I really care about. I think there\u0026rsquo;s crazy potential but ridiculously danger, right, which is can we trust AI with our cyber defenses? Over to you, James.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e00:25\u2028James Dell\u2028Cheers, thank you very much. So as I said, I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about can we trust AI with our cybersecurity defenses? I think the reason this really came to my mind when we was chatting through what the end of the year looks like is so many companies in the cybersecurity space have heavily started putting this AI badge around all of the products they do and whether that does really mean that they\u0026rsquo;re investing in LLM technologies, big data, whatever they\u0026rsquo;re doing, they\u0026rsquo;re very much putting it front and center. Which means to people not in the cybersecurity space, your board level executives, your people who are signing this off, they think AI is a great thing. But we\u0026rsquo;re also getting asked this question quite a lot as well. Should we trust AI with essentially defending my system? And that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m going to explore today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e01:08\u2028James Dell\u2028And certainly with the shift towards managed services and managed detection and response platforms, this really becomes more important than ever. So as I move forward, just to give you guys a bit of a background on me really so why I\u0026rsquo;m the person talking about this. So I\u0026rsquo;m James Dell, I\u0026rsquo;m technical architecture director for Planet it. But what that really means is my job is to work with cybersecurity vendors and understand their technologies as well as they do, so that I can translate that through to our customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e01:36\u2028James Dell\u2028Which means I have a unique advantage over many of you who might be end customers for some of these cybersecurity platforms we talk about in that I get to talk to all of them and work with all of them in a very detailed way and get to be part of their advisory boards and understand their back end infrastructure. So much so that I can then take it away and go, well, what have we learned and what have we understood from this? So I always put my email address on these as well. Because if you do feel you\u0026rsquo;ve got a question you want to ask, I\u0026rsquo;m always available to talk about these things afterwards. I appreciate that these can be quite a one way flow when we do these kind of events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e02:08\u2028James Dell\u2028I like to give you a lot of information and allow you to go and digest that. So I have to talk about plan it only quickly because they are letting me do this on company time. But ultimately we are a cyber security Specialist with over 22 years now experience in the market. So doing this a long time. So we know what we\u0026rsquo;re talking about. And I say we\u0026rsquo;ve got relationships with some of these, many of these vendors, which is why it all makes sense. Let\u0026rsquo;s get into the real content there. Right, so let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the, this kind of juxtaposition about, you know, human response versus AI led response and who\u0026rsquo;s kind of best to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e02:43\u2028James Dell\u2028So when we\u0026rsquo;re talking about any form of cyber incidents, we have always previously relied on very intelligent, very well trained humans, people who know their systems, know their technologies, know the risk factors, know how to respond. Up until the last couple of years, that has been the way that we responded. It\u0026rsquo;s with people. People led first, you were the response. There\u0026rsquo;s been a pivot in the last few years where that shift is now starting to be more, yes, it\u0026rsquo;s people, but it\u0026rsquo;s supported by technology. And as we enter 2025, it\u0026rsquo;s looking more like it\u0026rsquo;s technology leading the people. And that\u0026rsquo;s where I start to see this rub. Right, so is kind of is outsource, outsourcing CyberSecurity to an AI supported like security product really risking us losing control of what we do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e03:33\u2028James Dell\u2028You know, is it going to affect our ability to understand what we\u0026rsquo;re protecting or is it also going to result in us getting less skilled, less understanding of stuff in terms of what our systems do and how they protect? I can see that. For me, AI is a huge subject. It\u0026rsquo;s something that\u0026rsquo;s been a huge subject for a number of years. And cybersecurity has been something I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing for the last 20 years. And when you bring the two together, you can, I certainly can see the risk of both and I can see the benefits of both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e04:02\u2028James Dell\u2028Having been in many security instances where I\u0026rsquo;ve had to be at the front end and be responding and making those decisions and making those human led calls, I do know that sometimes actually having a bit of context and some of the bits that you don\u0026rsquo;t have, which AI is great at, can be really powerful. And some of the bits I\u0026rsquo;ll get onto later, there\u0026rsquo;s certainly some advantages there. But if we hand too much of that control over, are we really risking losing control completely? Are we risking the ability for us to be able to respond correctly? Or actually are we opening up even more of These pathways, these doorways into risking our cybersecurity overall. So I wanted to start by talking some of the really high level risks, when we talk risks of AI in the security space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e04:46\u2028James Dell\u2028And some of these you may have heard of before. And I may be kind of walking over this again for some people, but what I like to do with these things is I like to start from a position of let\u0026rsquo;s talk. So we\u0026rsquo;re all on the same page, right? And where I\u0026rsquo;m coming from. So the first thing is when we talk about risks is the adverse real attack. So attackers exploiting the AI systems themselves and using them to deliver their input. So maliciously crafting data designed to mislead AI models designed to really do something that the designer wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting. So, you know, attacker could, you know, subtly alter malware to evade AI driven detection systems, or even inject itself into the system and use the AI to its benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e05:30\u2028James Dell\u2028We\u0026rsquo;re seeing some more of this kind of happening with wider systems less in security space. But as more kind of general AI modeling ends up inside of security products, we\u0026rsquo;re going to see more risk from that. You\u0026rsquo;ve then got the kind of model bias and inaccuracies now I\u0026rsquo;ve kind of got my little man sort of left leaning there on my screen. The truth is that we all know that LLMs AI models do have a natural bias, given the data that they\u0026rsquo;re fed. And the problem we certainly see with security modeling is that they tend to be fed a certain type of data, they tend to be fed risk data, they tend to be fed incident data, indicators of attack, symptoms of attack, things like that. They tend to be fed that information, which means they naturally think everything is an attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e06:14\u2028James Dell\u2028So you start to see that actually by the nature of the way these models are trained, they start to develop quite a lot of false positives. And the vendors that I\u0026rsquo;ve been working with where they\u0026rsquo;ve integrated AI head heavily into their systems. One thing that I have noticed is they\u0026rsquo;ve done a lot of work to try and balance that bias and add in a lot of countermeasures and counterweights to try and balance that out, which already shows that maybe putting too much reliance on a model potentially shows a lot more risk than you would want to. So, you know, alongside this misclassification of data can be a huge issue. And it also just potentially opens you up to the chance that unnecessary results are triggered or things slip through the net because the bias doesn\u0026rsquo;t pick them up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e07:00\u2028James Dell\u2028We then start to See this kind of over reliance on automation. So organizations that you turn to AI and LLMs inside of their big data, inside of their models tend to use it at the detriment of human oversight. And the greatest example of this is in the kind of managed detection and response space or manage microsox space where you see a lot of these big organizations taking on multiple of thousands of customers under what would be quite a small team size if you thought about it in the traditional sense. And the way they\u0026rsquo;re doing that is they\u0026rsquo;re by going right, we\u0026rsquo;re going to put a lot of this through AI, LLM automation at the front end to try and weed out the false positives, the bad information from the alerts we see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e07:42\u2028James Dell\u2028What it tends to do though is leave a risk that actually you leave yourself too thin on that human layer and it creates critical threats that where human judgment may ultimately be misled or mishandling information because they\u0026rsquo;re not getting the full picture or maybe they\u0026rsquo;re getting it a bit too late because the bias has triggered the data in the wrong way. We\u0026rsquo;re seeing that being a very common theme. AI is seeing humans be displaced from security roles because it\u0026rsquo;s well for one human we can get 10,000 optimizations done. Yeah, that optimization may not be the right thing to do. As I kind of mentioned, around adverse real attacks is also the kind of the weaponization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e08:20\u2028James Dell\u2028So you know that we\u0026rsquo;re seeing it constantly, the bad actors and cyber criminals are using AI to develop more sophisticated attacks, but they\u0026rsquo;re also then able to weaponize the fact that AI is in these models for their benefit. We\u0026rsquo;re seeing quite a bit of that and seeing, you know, kind of AI driven phishing campaigns with the start of it. But this kind of dynamic adaption of kind of AI tools is really a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e08:44\u2028James Dell\u2028Then that kind of gets onto the point that I was talking about earlier on and we talking before this started around data poisoning, about the fact that actually now that attackers know so much of this defense work is done by AI or driven by LLMs or driven by big data, they could start to hide malicious code inside smaller attacks that would be used to train an AI model that when pulled together in the right way would give them a much bigger attack. And because of the way that we work, we\u0026rsquo;re going, oh, of synattack, let\u0026rsquo;s catalog it, let\u0026rsquo;s put the data, let\u0026rsquo;s teach the model on it. Well, maybe that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what they want and we\u0026rsquo;ve got to be really careful about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e09:22\u2028James Dell\u2028Data set that we\u0026rsquo;re using and how we work with it and make sure that we\u0026rsquo;re not allowing the risk of data poisoning or bad data to be sort of fed into the system. You know, AI systems will become less effective the more harmful data and also the more AI given data that they\u0026rsquo;re learning from. And we\u0026rsquo;re seeing more and more of that where we\u0026rsquo;re starting to sort of get diminished returns from some of these results, where we\u0026rsquo;re feeding back into its own information. There\u0026rsquo;s obviously the complexities as well, the complexity of explanation. Many IA systems operate kind of this black box approach where it makes it difficult to understand their decision making processes. We\u0026rsquo;re seeing that more and more with custom development being done by the different security vendors in putting them into their own tools and not wanting to show they\u0026rsquo;re working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10:13\u2028James Dell\u2028It\u0026rsquo;s a bit different when you look at the kind of OpenAI, your grunts, your lambdas, the world, what they\u0026rsquo;re doing is they\u0026rsquo;re very much exposing what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, the logic behind it to a degree. So you can understand the process. But you\u0026rsquo;ll see with a lot of the security products that are being developed out there that the transparency is starting to be removed and it\u0026rsquo;s starting to hide it. Which means that when it comes to incident response, auditing or even regulatory compliance, it actually can be quite difficult to justify how a decision was made or not made in many scenarios. Obviously there\u0026rsquo;s this dependency on large data sets. So when it comes to zero day attacks or very new style attacks, if the data\u0026rsquo;s not there, the decision making isn\u0026rsquo;t great. It also means there\u0026rsquo;s a high cost to running these things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10:58\u2028James Dell\u2028So you won\u0026rsquo;t see the ability for you to run these tools or develop these tools in small organizations. You\u0026rsquo;re going to be reliant on the big service providers, the big vendors to provide you with these solutions. And ultimately there\u0026rsquo;s always the regulatory and ethically concerning parts of all of this. You know, the more we adopt AI, the more it outpaces the laws, the guidance, the ethical controls that we have in place. And also potentially the more IT risks essentially the access that humans are having in this space and you know, could cost jobs at the detriment of security to a degree. I\u0026rsquo;ll just take a. Sorry, so is there a question?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:37\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028Yeah, so I actually had quite a number of questions right on that one because I was saying if you\u0026rsquo;re going to expand or you\u0026rsquo;re going to go to a different model, can you go back just a slide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:48\u2028James Dell\u2028Yeah, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:50\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028So, so I think one of the key points, right, which kind of weaves into this, right, is the whole idea that the more black boxes we have in the middle of this whole thing, the worse it gets. Right. And so one of the interesting questions is to ask is how do we know that our current models and our current pipeline is not already compromised?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12:14\u2028James Dell\u2028That\u0026rsquo;s the million dollar question, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? That\u0026rsquo;s the. We, we don\u0026rsquo;t know. We\u0026rsquo;re assuming. Especially when you put the trust into, you know, third parties that are gathering this data and building these tools. You\u0026rsquo;re assuming that they\u0026rsquo;re doing that checking, right? You\u0026rsquo;re assuming that they are putting some form of checks and balances in place around the data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12:32\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028Okay, yeah, but I was kind of, I was going to the point of, let\u0026rsquo;s say you use one of the sims, right? So in a way you\u0026rsquo;ve got two points there, right? You\u0026rsquo;ve got, okay, the SIM could be compromised and that\u0026rsquo;ll be a massive. Right. And they will probably detect it, they\u0026rsquo;ll deal with it, right. That\u0026rsquo;s almost like it\u0026rsquo;s a software platform, right? Like that. In a way it\u0026rsquo;s reasonable, kind of deterministic, right. You put data in to get data out, right? You notice very weirdly that you put a data in the SIEM and you get different data out from the sim. You go, wait, something is really wrong here. Yeah, you can have, that\u0026rsquo;s kind of handled already. And you can have the data being compromised, but then the data is still there. You still get the same data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e13:16\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028You could have bad data, you could have data that has been encrypted or data been manipulated, right? But that means that you can follow that path in a way. There\u0026rsquo;s no black boxes there, right there. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of a bit of logic. There\u0026rsquo;s not a lot of black boxes. But in this world, their models in the middle are the model itself or the data that the model is now consuming is compromised. Then what do you do? And how do you know that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e13:45\u2028James Dell\u2028Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s the thing is, to a degree you\u0026rsquo;re not going to know, are you? Unless you can understand the decision tree or the decision logic that was used by the model, which, because it\u0026rsquo;s black box, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to get, you are going to end up in this position where you\u0026rsquo;re inferring trust into something which is naturally untrustworthy because you don\u0026rsquo;t know how it works, right? It\u0026rsquo;s the whole reason we came through Blackbox software development was you remove the need to understand the system, but the need to understand the system in the case of LLMs and AI is half the battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14:20\u2028James Dell\u2028If you don\u0026rsquo;t understand what it does, then you\u0026rsquo;re never going to understand whether the bad result is because of what it\u0026rsquo;s doing or whether it\u0026rsquo;s because that somewhere else that you\u0026rsquo;ve had the data has been poisoned or the data set\u0026rsquo;s been corrupted, or that actually it just happens to be a really poorly written model. Not going to know that because there\u0026rsquo;s this obfuscation of what the data really is and what the result is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14:41\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028But, but I think this is worse than that because I remember when I was doing some crazy exploits, right? And I remember when we got. Because confidentiality was always. And I was. I always say confidentiality is easy to deal with. It\u0026rsquo;s fucking pain, yes, but it\u0026rsquo;s easy to deal with because you kind of know, right? But I remember were doing these exploits on integrity and then I start asking the question, how bad does it need to be for you to be like, where does it go? Exponential the loss of trust, right? And I was always amazed how little data needs to be corrupted for people to go, I cannot trust this thing anymore. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e15:17\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028It\u0026rsquo;s a bit like if you have a website and suddenly you start to have five customers, 10 customers, 50 customers who say the data is wrong and you don\u0026rsquo;t know where it\u0026rsquo;s coming and you don\u0026rsquo;t know how it\u0026rsquo;s being wrong. You just really have proof that small quantity is wrong, right? There\u0026rsquo;s a moment where you have to pull the plug on everything, right? Because you kind of don\u0026rsquo;t know it is. So take it this scenario where you have some evidence that the model is corrupted, right? Because clearly you put an input, you got an output, you\u0026rsquo;re going, dude, there\u0026rsquo;s a blind spot here. Literally there\u0026rsquo;s a blind spot, right? What do you do then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e15:55\u2028James Dell\u2028I suppose that\u0026rsquo;s it, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? I suppose if you control it. So this is coming on to. What I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about is that the. If you\u0026rsquo;re controlling the use of that tool, AI LLM, then yeah, you can pull that, right? You can make the decision to take that out of your workflow and take the additional pain that may put on you. But the core underlying problem we\u0026rsquo;ve got is that these tools are being baked into the traditional endpoint products, the firewalling products, the things that you would have traditionally, you know, just Had a product that goes, here\u0026rsquo;s the data, here\u0026rsquo;s a result is what we do. And you have no control over that. And you trying to, you know, dissuade one of them, the big five cyber security vendors to take their tool out because you\u0026rsquo;ve detected it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e16:40\u2028James Dell\u2028It\u0026rsquo;s not going to happen because they need that marketing buzzword of having this AI tool in there. So they\u0026rsquo;re going to, they\u0026rsquo;ll run that regardless. And when you talk to them, they\u0026rsquo;re so hell bent on this, it\u0026rsquo;s so heavily integrated to their entire system. It\u0026rsquo;s not just, oh, we\u0026rsquo;re using it in a small bit here, we\u0026rsquo;re using it at the front end. We\u0026rsquo;re using it for the data pipeline, we\u0026rsquo;re using it for automation. And you go, well, there\u0026rsquo;s so many places there where that could do exactly what you said. It could be just a little bit wrong. But you\u0026rsquo;ve then got that compounded effect and you\u0026rsquo;ve got no control and no ability to pull that out. Right. And this is where my underlying question is, right? So can you trust it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e17:17\u2028James Dell\u2028Well, you know, if you\u0026rsquo;re in control of it, you maybe can trust it, but if you\u0026rsquo;re not, or you\u0026rsquo;re also not in control of, if it\u0026rsquo;s being used, then you can\u0026rsquo;t really trust it, can you? Because you\u0026rsquo;ve got no visibility and you\u0026rsquo;ve got no control over how much of a sway of your protection that is having.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e17:34\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028Yeah, but I think that\u0026rsquo;s a risk that we need to start quantifying. Right? Because in a way we\u0026rsquo;ve come with a solution like that and we have circuit breakers, right? We have solutions, right. You know, you have two or three even let the CDN stuff where the main one, if that blows up, you redirect the traffic to the next one and eventually you hit, you know, the expensive one. But they can handle it, right? So yeah, I think that\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s a big one, man, especially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18:00\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028And I think the key part here is if these companies or whatever build a system, you have a model that learned for me that is the biggest red flag now because if you so like, the model I like is one where you use off the shelf models and you give it the data do, I mean, so in a way as soon as you have bad data, you can go, right, I can debug it, right? Like, and I think the word you said there was really cool, was complex explainability. So I tend to talk about provenance, but I think that\u0026rsquo;s really important, right. If we cannot absolutely trace back, right. How the decisions were made and then tweak it. Right. Or fix it, right. Then if right away in the middle you have a model that just has been trained. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18:43\u2028James Dell\u2028Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18:43\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028You know, I think that\u0026rsquo;s a ridiculous risk. Right. That\u0026rsquo;s the risk we never had before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18:48\u2028James Dell\u2028No, it\u0026rsquo;s a new thing that started and it\u0026rsquo;s only becoming more prevalent as we push forward. Right. That\u0026rsquo;s, that\u0026rsquo;s the problem with it is it\u0026rsquo;s a new risk that\u0026rsquo;s been introduced. And when you were doing your old risk matrices, they want something you never have considered before, but now it\u0026rsquo;s like, hold on, that\u0026rsquo;s probably more risky than a lot of other things that are happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19:04\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028Yeah. But then take into account that the instance response team tends to be ridiculously high privileged. Right. Has access to ridiculous amount of information. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a prime attack vector itself. Right. So no, and I think that, you know, but I think you kind of have this view there, right? Like, and I share with you, like it\u0026rsquo;s ridiculous to dangerous. I think we need to quantify it. Right. And I think we need to have a better way to explain how much of that black box. And maybe we need better analysis. Right. It\u0026rsquo;s like saying, all right, you got a magic SQL database. Maybe you should say, okay, you have a magic SQL database. You put data in, we don\u0026rsquo;t know how it works. Right. And you get data out. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19:44\u2028James Dell\u2028Is it good data? We don\u0026rsquo;t know. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19:46\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028And you don\u0026rsquo;t have store procedures. Right. You don\u0026rsquo;t have parameterized queries. So everything goes in and it\u0026rsquo;s magical. Right. So what the hell, right? So, and I think that there\u0026rsquo;s definitely a lack of analogies here. Right. And, and I think this world, especially because it\u0026rsquo;s on the forefront of the attackers, I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to see some dramatic stuff, but gone. I just want to have some.\n\u2028\n20:07\u2028James Dell\u2028No, I\u0026rsquo;ve got some data in a minute that will play into that as well. So, yeah, I think that the point you make is perfect. What I wanted to come on and just talk about was this kind of underpinning kind of issue that we have. So we\u0026rsquo;re getting this more and more of the security copilot is just the one that I\u0026rsquo;ve referenced. Obviously Microsoft have done a lot of work with OpenAI and they\u0026rsquo;ve introduced this kind of wraparound that sits on top of their siem tool now. And the truth is, just because you\u0026rsquo;ve got these tools doesn\u0026rsquo;t suddenly make you, as I\u0026rsquo;ve put here, a threat hunting God. You\u0026rsquo;re not going to be able to just go, right, I don\u0026rsquo;t need any skills whatsoever. So I\u0026rsquo;ve got security copilot and I just bang into it, what does the detection mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e20:48\u2028James Dell\u2028And you know, crassly I\u0026rsquo;ve done this. But this is actually the result that comes out depending on what you ask, which is essentially engage some experts, which is just like really useful. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually tell you to fix the problem at all. It says this is a detection that means X. What Step one. Step one is to engage a cybersecurity expert. It\u0026rsquo;s almost. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t. And give you the breadcrumbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21:08\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028I think a point you should make there is that just to dispel this myth, right. These tools will make the security experts even more. I think we need to be clear. I think anybody who\u0026rsquo;s taking view this is a great way to get rid of people or experts is in for a shock. What I think this allows us, it allows to be crazy more productive. In fact, allows us to finally play the game. Right. I think that\u0026rsquo;s the difference. Right. But you need even more expertise because you\u0026rsquo;re going to operate at much higher levels, even of impact. Right. Which basically means that the side effects of what you do are massive. So the idea that you don\u0026rsquo;t need experts into this is just crazy. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21:45\u2028James Dell\u2028Yeah. And that\u0026rsquo;s where we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a lot of that shift. Right? We\u0026rsquo;re seeing that shift come from the marketing tells people that you buy this tool or you add this tool on and suddenly you can empower people who aren\u0026rsquo;t empowered. And this is what I wanted to come and talk to, just touch on was certainly in the space that I sit in, obviously we work with a lot of IT professionals. And what I mean when I say that is not a disservice to anyone. But I mean, they\u0026rsquo;re not cybersecurity experts. They\u0026rsquo;re not people who do this all day out. They are people that wear two hats. They\u0026rsquo;re people that wear that blue cybersecurity hat and they wear the standard keeping the lights on it hat, which means that they don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know what all that stuff in blue is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e22:24\u2028James Dell\u2028They don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know what that blue data is. They do know how to install antivirus product and how to deal with something when it\u0026rsquo;s not working. But what they don\u0026rsquo;t know is what to do that data and their reliance of, oh, well, I\u0026rsquo;ll use a security copilot or something else to tell me what the solution is becomes really high. And once they start doing that, you end up in a position where you\u0026rsquo;ve got a person or people who don\u0026rsquo;t know necessarily what they\u0026rsquo;re doing or why they\u0026rsquo;re asking the question, trying to prompt an LLM for a response that they think is going to give an adequate response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e22:57\u2028James Dell\u2028And then suddenly you introduce another set of risks where you go, well, great, you can, you know, you\u0026rsquo;re giving someone a tool, but you\u0026rsquo;re essentially giving someone who\u0026rsquo;s overwhelmed, doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know what they\u0026rsquo;re looking at, critical data and critical decision making to pump back into an LLM, which you don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know how it\u0026rsquo;s been trained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e23:15\u2028James Dell\u2028It seems like a lot of risk going on there for my liking, and that\u0026rsquo;s something I just wanted to, you know, just wanted to highlight is we see this a lot and people, especially over the last 12 months, who have picked up Copilot for security or some of the other big products out there which tap into SIEM data and use LLMs to provide it in human language, who were not, you know, cyber security professionals day in and day out are finding the tool to be either overwhelming or massively too complex for them to use because the results they get, they just don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e23:46\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028Exactly. I think here it\u0026rsquo;d be cool for you to also add a human layer to this. And because I actually feel that there is. There tends to be very different personalities. Right. By design, almost. Right. Like in a way, the engineers knows how to build stuff. Right. But they tend to have a very understanding of putting things together, stability. What it sometimes don\u0026rsquo;t have is that like what can go wrong and what else can it do? Right. And also the side effects where in security, we also think a lot about the side effects, we think about the signals. Right. But I think there\u0026rsquo;s also a crossover because to be honest, like a lot of the people on the left don\u0026rsquo;t know how to engineer good things. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e24:25\u2028James Dell\u2028So that\u0026rsquo;s the problem too. Right, that\u0026rsquo;s okay. Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e24:28\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028And so the only comment I also made on your statement is that I think, yes, it\u0026rsquo;s a problem, but I also feel that we now have the ability to scale at both ends. Right. So what I mean is now we now have the ability, let\u0026rsquo;s say smaller teams and smaller environments to have access to a lot of that expertise that just not possible. Right. And Also it\u0026rsquo;s possible for finally the security crowd to get access to proper good intelligence because it goes both ways. The problem is you still need the experts in the room and in the loop because if you don\u0026rsquo;t have them you\u0026rsquo;re going to end up, you know, with even a worse scenario. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e25:01\u2028James Dell\u2028Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s it. So coming on this, this would probably tie in a bit to what were talking about earlier, right? So you know we talk about traditional seam approaching, right? So you know you\u0026rsquo;re pulling the data in that we\u0026rsquo;ve got referenced on this left hand side here from some various data sources and where we\u0026rsquo;re seeing this kind of AI, lms, ML, AI, LLMs, automation, all kind of pulled in is through this piece, this the kind of, the AI detection and data handling piece. I put it in the backend data lake. But you can see the amount of data that\u0026rsquo;s being processed by these and the amount of decisions that are being made. So when we talk about a large organization, there\u0026rsquo;s millions of bits of data that come in from those data sources and that\u0026rsquo;s your big data piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e25:48\u2028James Dell\u2028But then they\u0026rsquo;re filed through that threat intelligence, normally a big data set which limits that down to thousands of detections which then is put through some form of ML and AI, which gives them the automated respons, which provides some contextualization which strips that down to hundreds. Then it\u0026rsquo;s pumped through some form of automation normally kind of, you know, trying to work out whether it\u0026rsquo;s a false positive, all those kind of things, some form of LLM backend, some human decision making and you end up with the tens, you end up with the what\u0026rsquo;s pushed to a person, to a managed, you know, to a managed text and response or to a managed sock, your human piece. But what you\u0026rsquo;ve done there is that reliance on putting data into the hands of something you don\u0026rsquo;t control. That back to that black box conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e26:34\u2028James Dell\u2028We\u0026rsquo;ve had millions of bits of information that before it\u0026rsquo;s reached someone in this pipeline has been stripped down to tens. Now it can do this really well, but you can see the margin of error is very large. And that\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;ve drawn that little pipe in there in terms of that detection, contextualization and correlation, right? If that\u0026rsquo;s working perfectly, you get some really solid, good quality high risk information that\u0026rsquo;s put in front of those threat experts who can investigate and eliminate attacks. But if something goes wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s very quickly could be lost in that chain, and that\u0026rsquo;s why I kind of wanted to put this in here, is like, you know, we talk a lot about making sure you get the right data in.\n\u2028\n27:15\u2028James Dell\u2028And certainly anything where you talk to someone about how to do security properly in 2024, 2025, it\u0026rsquo;s about making sure you have as much data as possible to give you context, that correlation in a platform that can do that. Now, obviously, you know, you can just have a seam tool and try and do it yourself, but you are going to struggle with that quality and that quantity of data. But then we have to trust what we\u0026rsquo;re putting this data through. And that\u0026rsquo;s where, you know, I\u0026rsquo;m always nervous at the moment because like you said, we don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily have the visibility into what that big data model, what that ML, AI, what the LLM or automation looks like, because those are those bits that are being developed by those security vendors or those seam tool manufacturers.\n\u2028\n28:00\u2028James Dell\u2028They\u0026rsquo;re being developed by them in the back end and they don\u0026rsquo;t want to give away their secret sauce. I get that. But also there\u0026rsquo;s a degree of it would be safer from a point of view of openness to be using a model that is open source where you can see it, because then you know to your point what the data is and what the model is. So therefore, if the results don\u0026rsquo;t match, then at least you can start to work out where things are going to go wrong. But there\u0026rsquo;s a huge degree in this middle piece here where we are, we\u0026rsquo;re seeing, you know, especially managed.\n\u2028\n28:29\u2028James Dell\u2028And the reason I put this managed detection and response services is this is where we\u0026rsquo;re seeing it more prevalently than anywhere else is these companies are putting huge investment into streamlining their pipeline so that the human element can be dramatically reduced from where it was three years ago. They can continue to cut down resources and cut down people and grow services without having to invest in staff because they\u0026rsquo;re only really investing in the technology that makes the human have to look at less. Yeah.\n\u2028\n29:00\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028Can I try one thing? Let me see if I can put a screen share here and then, because that\u0026rsquo;s a great. Because annoyingly, zoom doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow us.\n\u2028\n29:12\u2028James Dell\u2028Cool.\n\u2028\n29:13\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028Can you see this?\n\u2028\n29:14\u2028James Dell\u2028Yes, I can see that. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e29:16\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028Oh, cool. Cool. Right. So see, I think you could see the picture. Right? Yeah, cool. See, I kind of agree with you because you\u0026rsquo;re saying that if we start to have that whole yellow thing as a black box. Right. Yes, it is. Right. Because then how the whole thing fit together. Right. See Where I think is interesting is to use here, right, in these bits, right? I think there\u0026rsquo;s two elements of this, I think there\u0026rsquo;s an element of doing a transformation here, right, where you kind of use a kind of AI to sort of, you know, let\u0026rsquo;s say, process, you know, the data as you go from one layer to the other, right? But what I think is really interesting is to use AI actually here, which is in the creation of those standards do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e30:07\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028I mean, what I think is really powerful is almost saying, look, and this is the thing that always pain me in the Steam world is that instead of saying let\u0026rsquo;s, you know, kind of, you know, get to that point in the end, right, let\u0026rsquo;s actually spend and actually this person should be working here, you know what I mean? I think where we need a lot of the experts, right? We need a lot of experts here powered by Genai tools that help us to create these data transformations, right? And the power of that is that the data transformations ideally should actually be code or should be done by like you said, an open source LLM. Right? So you kind of. Yeah, yeah, sorry, saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e30:57\u2028James Dell\u2028No, I was saying that\u0026rsquo;s exactly it, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? It\u0026rsquo;s like that the reason that yellow pipe is there is that black box that is that hidden, the hidden unknown. And if you\u0026rsquo;re stripping that much from the human there is always the risk of something not being right and we are going the wrong way. But it\u0026rsquo;s, I think this conversation\u0026rsquo;s always been driven by where kind of the big five or six cyber security companies want. They think they can make the most money rather than it being in a position where they\u0026rsquo;re going, oh, actually, well, what would best for data security? And if you\u0026rsquo;re running an internal, you know, an internal team of a decent size, then yeah, you can put a seam tool in and start putting the people where they should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e31:37\u2028James Dell\u2028But what I\u0026rsquo;m certainly seeing from the kind of the managed services side of things is that you\u0026rsquo;re seeing that those kind of mssps are spinning up. You\u0026rsquo;re seeing these vendors pushing these products out and the way they\u0026rsquo;re making them cost effective is by making that pipeline in the middle completely opaque. You cannot see into it and you just hope the data you pump into the front end comes out to the right results of the back end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e31:59\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028Yeah, yeah, gonna go back to your slides. But, but I, I, I think that\u0026rsquo;s a crazy risk, man. And, and what I think is interesting in this world is that what those companies are doing is they\u0026rsquo;re putting themselves in a danger position because their biggest competitors probably will not be at the sims. Their billion competitors are going to be some of the other data visualization platforms that are going to do this right and they\u0026rsquo;re just going to happen to the security better than everybody else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e32:22\u2028James Dell\u2028Yeah, exactly. I\u0026rsquo;m. I\u0026rsquo;ll just. I\u0026rsquo;ve realized I cannot say bad mouth but I\u0026rsquo;ve talked badly about AI in detection and I wanted to always want to give you the counter side to that. And I think the reason that this slide is just to quickly touch on some of those key benefits you only get though when you start putting AI into this work workflow. So it\u0026rsquo;s just worth talking about. So there\u0026rsquo;s a kind of four key pillars to where you get good value from AI in the cyber security space and especially in threat detection. So is the, you\u0026rsquo;ve got the investigation, the identity, reporting and research. Those are the four pillars where it works really well. At no point does it replace a human and you\u0026rsquo;ll be key to see that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ve put in my slide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e33:08\u2028James Dell\u2028It\u0026rsquo;s about empowering to the point you were just making. It\u0026rsquo;s about empowering people to make the right decision. Right. And those things it can do really well is for things from enhanced threat detection. So we\u0026rsquo;re talking about bringing the data together but data from different sources that potentially are in different languages, stored in different methodologies, that stuff is great for because it can, it\u0026rsquo;s easy. It\u0026rsquo;s great at sifting through data, correlation of data, looking at patterns. Humans are really bad at spotting patterns in big data because you just can\u0026rsquo;t consume it all. Something like an LLM is great for doing that kind of detection piece as same as kind of the sifting through IOCs and IOAs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e33:46\u2028James Dell\u2028If you\u0026rsquo;re looking at indication of compromises or indicators of attack back and you\u0026rsquo;re looking at thousands of them on a huge scale event as again as a human you start to lose concentration after about nine or ten that you\u0026rsquo;ve read. And that\u0026rsquo;s just humans. We\u0026rsquo;re just not very good at consuming data in that way. But using a tool to give you the ability to do that\u0026rsquo;s great. And again the key word for me is tool. We\u0026rsquo;re not talking about replacing it with a system. We\u0026rsquo;re talking about giving a tool that can be used for that piece but doesn\u0026rsquo;t make the decision for you. It\u0026rsquo;s there to help you go through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e34:17\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028The Information on those three, I think other, by the way, I\u0026rsquo;m with you. Like, I think gen AI and these LLMs finally is going to allow us to make this industry really work. Right. And I think this is going to tip. I think this has the potential to tip the advantage to the defenders because we can finally have a lot of visibility into what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Right. I think there\u0026rsquo;s a key pattern here that on these three things you mentioned, which was that up until now, every time you want to make tech better, you had to write some code. Right, Right. And that\u0026rsquo;s a massive game changer because it means that, for example, you can now consume different data sources in the same LLM without changing anything. Right. And that\u0026rsquo;s massive, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e34:59\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028It\u0026rsquo;s massive because they have an ability to process unstructured data that we never had before. And that was always the challenge. The challenge was, if you think about our pipelines were also very brittle, they were very fragile and you always have to code new stuff on top of it. Right. Where if you. That\u0026rsquo;s why in a way the innovation in this space was always so slow because everybody, even the big providers, you know, basically they\u0026rsquo;re doing a good job in a lot of times. Right. But I think the model is broken and they never, I think, went to fix the model itself. Right. And the model is that up until now you have to write integrations almost by hand for everything and that never scaled. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e35:40\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028So these bits that you have here, even those patterns, we now have a much better comprehensive engine to do that. The key, I think is not to have a model that has already got the bias. The key is to even use three different models to ask the same question. Right. And if you get the same answer, you now know that you probably have a good finding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e35:58\u2028James Dell\u2028Yeah, exactly. Yeah. No, perfect. Yeah. I say the final pieces of things that we always talk about when we talk about it, so 24 7, 365, they don\u0026rsquo;t need to sleep. So that means that you don\u0026rsquo;t lose the context between one threat analyst going off and the next threat analyst coming on because the context is held and you know, the benefit is there they can be more cost efficient than having lots and lots of threat hunters because they can do things like pattern detection. The threat hunters can\u0026rsquo;t do very well. But also on the flip side, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to see you replacing everyone with AI because it\u0026rsquo;s just ridiculous. It can help improve accuracy in some scenarios, but you have to be using it in the Right way back to all the points you\u0026rsquo;ve made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e36:36\u2028James Dell\u2028You can\u0026rsquo;t just go well we\u0026rsquo;ve given this system and LLM therefore it\u0026rsquo;s more accurate. Well if the data you\u0026rsquo;ve given it is rubbish, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be rubbish. And it\u0026rsquo;s about making sure that you give it the right data. The big thing that it can do is reduce that response time. So the time between something going wrong and you making the right call in the right hands. So if we go back to the co pilot for security and you\u0026rsquo;ve got someone who is a trained threat hunter and they see a certain detection and they ask the right question to the LM and say what does this mean in this context? Because of this, with this data and they get the right result out of it, it will cut down the amount of time it takes to them to respond and take the relevant actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e37:15\u2028James Dell\u2028But if they don\u0026rsquo;t know what the prompts are, they don\u0026rsquo;t know what the information is that needs to be looking at then just a child with a toy and they\u0026rsquo;re just going to end up getting the wrong answers. So again it can be really powerful in the right hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e37:26\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028But that\u0026rsquo;s ridiculously powerful. In fact once we did analysis and we mapped out that the fastest we can find about it is, was the biggest correlated item that determined the impact of the incident. And there was actually a guy that was on a team that was ex milit and used to say that they had this, they said the faster you can get a medic or somebody into the medical center that has been injured is literally the percentage of survivability are only correlated. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what you had, what matters is how fast can we get quickly together. Yeah, yeah. And I think that reduced response time is massive here. Right. Because like you said, the more you can reduce that where somebody with knowledge knows the difference between false positives or only press the bad signal. Right. This is a big, this deal. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e38:10\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028That\u0026rsquo;s the big thing. I also, the one I would add to the top I think is teach, which I think is a thing that we overlooked and then they keep losing their talent. Right. You know, and, but I think that we have the ability to create much better learning paths and to bring people into for example instance response that before were really hard to do or very dangerous. Right. In a way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e38:32\u2028James Dell\u2028Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e38:33\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028So I think there\u0026rsquo;s a teaching element that you could also have of explaining how you do things, why you do things. You know, taking somebody that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have death, maybe on some areas, and saying, look, you need to learn about this, this, this. But then you\u0026rsquo;re learning in context, which makes a lot more sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e38:48\u2028James Dell\u2028No, yeah, it makes complete sense. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think about it that way. That\u0026rsquo;s a, that\u0026rsquo;s a very valid point, is that you is teaching the people that we\u0026rsquo;ve already got and using it to upskill. Right? Yep. So just to quickly recap some of the things I\u0026rsquo;ve said around, oh, I hope my PowerPoint stopped working. There we go. So importantly, obviously, when we talk about these risks, right, there\u0026rsquo;s how much reliance there is. Right. We\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about that quite heavily is how much are you relying on it. There\u0026rsquo;s also the piece around how much are we trusting a single algorithm or a single bit of code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e39:23\u2028James Dell\u2028And what I mean by that is if we take one specific vendor, for example, and I\u0026rsquo;m not going to mention them by name, but you think about the one that caused a major incident this year with outages. There was hundreds of thousands of endpoints affected by one single platform. If that one platform is using one single algorithm to provide itself, you know, to provide it\u0026rsquo;s AI that\u0026rsquo;s driven into the product and it\u0026rsquo;s compromised by a threat actor. They\u0026rsquo;ve suddenly compromised not just one system, they\u0026rsquo;ve compromised that over hundreds of thousands of endpoints. And beyond that, sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s an integrated system and they\u0026rsquo;re these custom models that have been built. It. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot of reliance on a single point of failure. So you have to look at that when you\u0026rsquo;re looking at the risks is going, is that a benefit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e40:04\u2028James Dell\u2028You know, again, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of, certainly in the, with the vendors I\u0026rsquo;ve been working with, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of false positives or false negatives that are coming through when they are using the correlation contextualization piece via a black box LLM, they are, they\u0026rsquo;re going, oh, we\u0026rsquo;re getting lots of false positives because it\u0026rsquo;s just the data and the bias is making it think that. Or things that should have been caught or a human would have caught from a seam tool are being lost because it\u0026rsquo;s going. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s important because again, it\u0026rsquo;s biases against that. So it\u0026rsquo;s definitely, for me, it\u0026rsquo;s something you have to keep thinking about is what does that data look like. And ultimately the piece we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about for a lot of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2024/mini-summits/Dec/Governance/","event":"mini-summit","expirydate":-62135596800,"facebook":null,"fuzzywordcount":8400,"hey_summit":null,"image":null,"job_title":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752075784,"layout":"","linkedin":null,"notes":null,"objectID":"d2e7f53775f11ab84b90abb80937b155","organizers":null,"permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/dec/governance/can-we-trust-ai-with-our-cyber-defences.transcript/","project":"Risk and Governance","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":40,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2024/mini-summits/dec/governance/can-we-trust-ai-with-our-cyber-defences.transcript/","section":"sessions","status":null,"summary":"\u003cp\u003e00:02\u2028Dinis Cruz\u2028Hi, welcome to the first Open Security summit session in December 2024.

00:00\nYou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 00:02\nHi. Welcome to this, I think, very exciting session in October, 2023, maybe\nin the future, this is going to be solved. But where we are today, this is a\nvery interesting topic, where we\u0026rsquo;re going to be talking about the gen AI\nand privacy, but looking at it from the point of it\u0026rsquo;s a massive opportunity\nfor privacy, but also it\u0026rsquo;s massive uncertainty. Right. So there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of\nareas here and Sarah take because you got some slides to guide us\nthrough it, and now we rock from sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 00:31\nI mean, this is what you get when you chat with Dinis. He asked you to do\na talk about it. So this is why, I mean, I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to get across what\nthe governance challenges might be of this, involving myself in not for\nprofits and doing an awful lot of reading. There was no way just reading\nwas going to do it. I needed to speak to people who knew their stuff could\nget under the technical hood and look across the piece to feel around the\nedges. So this is where this is coming from. It\u0026rsquo;s not a desperately technical\ntalk. There\u0026rsquo;s lots of individual aspects you can look up, like, what\u0026rsquo;s the\ncurrent technical standard for bias assessment? That\u0026rsquo;s not where I\u0026rsquo;m\ncoming from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 01:05\nI\u0026rsquo;m coming from a place of how can your average business get across this,\ngrasp the opportunities and deal with the uncertainties when they are not\nan AI specialist company? So, first of all, I wanted to put up what Dennis\nhad suggested we talk about. Bear in mind he gave us half an hour. So the\nman is nothing but ambitious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:27\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to go a bit longer, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 01:29\nYeah, we\u0026rsquo;ll see how we, you know, we\u0026rsquo;re going to get across some of this.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to wrap it into some of the stuff that I\u0026rsquo;m going to cover. I know\nDennis will be interrupting and then I\u0026rsquo;ll rein him in and then we\u0026rsquo;ll get\nthrough some more slides and we\u0026rsquo;ll do fine. First of all, I wanted to just\ndefine some terms. So I\u0026rsquo;m looking at this from data protection point of\nview rather than privacy. The distinction is that privacy is one of the rights\nthat data protection looks to protect. It\u0026rsquo;s actually about any potential\nharms to the rights and freedoms of people that can come from any aspect\nof data processing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 02:00\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s not simply about retaining secrecy or confidentiality, it is about is\ndata being used in a way that could cause you harm, could cause you a\nrisk to any of your rights. Perhaps it might be your right to vote, your right\nto life, your right to nondiscrimination. So all of those things come into it.\nI generated these images with Dali just for fun and being a child at heart. I\nhad to have the one on the right as an example. I asked it to produce an\nexample of most of the current use cases, common use cases for\ngenerative AI and the kind of prevalent models at the moment. And the\none reason I selected this one is because it\u0026rsquo;s put AI fart instead of AI art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 02:40\nI was reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 02:41\nIt was definitely a keeper. It really sort of underlines one aspect of this\nthat there are a lot of limitations. There are edges around what it can and\ncan\u0026rsquo;t do. There are amazing things it\u0026rsquo;s doing like picking up flow\ndiagrams, translating those into code, which is opening the door to a lot\nmore accessible plain language coding, no code solutions. But I couldn\u0026rsquo;t\nget it to remove the text elements of this no matter how hard I tried. It\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t do it. Once they\u0026rsquo;re treated as vectors, then you\u0026rsquo;re done. It won\u0026rsquo;t\ntake them out again. So it\u0026rsquo;s just a little indication of where I\u0026rsquo;m coming\nfrom in terms of generative AI. Most people have a broadish\nunderstanding of it who are likely to be on this kind of call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 03:21\nWe know it\u0026rsquo;s a predictive text edge engine, but we also know that it\u0026rsquo;s\nproducing capabilities that are far beyond just that simple interpretation\nof it. It feels like a really solid iteration of Search where you have a\nmarketing advantage, a market advantage from being accurate and\ncomplete. So it\u0026rsquo;s moving in the direction that we would like it to be able to\naccess a lot of deep data. And of course there\u0026rsquo;s the bespoke versions of it\nwhere you can train with your own data. Of course I\u0026rsquo;m talking about Chat\nGPT because it\u0026rsquo;s blown the lid off this. But there are about thousands and\nthousands of large language models and other multimodal models out\nthere and a lot of them are more fit for one purpose or another. This is\nfrom a risk management point of view. My background is risk\nmanagement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 04:12\nI\u0026rsquo;m looking at how can I get across this rapidly defensibly to make space\nto get into it, look at it, explore the potential of it, but also not open the\ndoor to Gotchas moving forward. And the baseline truth is, you cannot\nstart to assess risk to get some kind of pragmatic bead on required\ncontrols until you understand the use case context, until you understand\nthe data set and model that you\u0026rsquo;re using, whether it\u0026rsquo;s embedded and\nintegrated with other models whether it\u0026rsquo;s integrated into another solution\nwhere in the business it\u0026rsquo;s going to impact you, where in society it might\nimpact which user bases it\u0026rsquo;s going to impact is that going to be\napproximate and urgent impact? Is it just surfacing something that\u0026rsquo;s going\nto help you do your job better? Or is it making a benefits entitlement\ndecision?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 05:02\nYou have things along a big continuum here and I think with the\nexistential risk discussions it has really masked the everyday rolling out of\nautomation that we really need to be paying attention to where we\u0026rsquo;re\nperhaps standardizing. And removing post implementation redress at quite\na rate, as well as looking at the advantages to improve day jobs that are\nmoving in a positive direction. So I can\u0026rsquo;t stress it enough that we need to\nlook at some of the good categorizations that are out there and\nunderstand where generative AI can be a positive bonus and where we\nneed to still keep an eye on what\u0026rsquo;s happening with broader automation\nthat\u0026rsquo;s impacting people right now. So this is just a wall of text, my\napologies. It\u0026rsquo;s part of the not having an awful lot of time to prepare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 05:57\nThis is just some of the elements of privacy risk that I have on my radar.\nCan we extract personal data out of training sets? Is there a risk of model\ninversion? Is just whoever\u0026rsquo;s got the training data because training data\nhas been acquired handover fist by all sorts of people to feed models, are\nthey controlling it prior to training and post training? That point about\nfurther automation without redress for errors, are we innovating in the\npost market monitoring as well as we\u0026rsquo;re innovating in the automation and\nworkflow automation space? People aren\u0026rsquo;t really grasping that if you are\nfeeding data to models that it\u0026rsquo;ll be ingested and the clarity of purposes\nthat will be used for later for publicly available or open source models.\nOpen source models isn\u0026rsquo;t perhaps desperately transparent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 06:52\nBias is going to continue to be an issue and it\u0026rsquo;s a philosophical issue as\nmuch as a technical and data issue. Against what ground truth baseline do\nwe want to moderate for bias? Are we trying to better than the society we\nare in terms of balance and equity? Or are we operating to an imperfect\nground truth that we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with right now? That\u0026rsquo;s before you start to\nget into the technical aspects of bias and I\u0026rsquo;ve got a link further on that\ntakes you into the weeds of looking at bias through different lenses for you\nto look at in your own time, we know that it\u0026rsquo;s amplifying the capabilities\nof attackers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 07:28\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to watch a great talk next week at the Mitre conference from\nsomebody who\u0026rsquo;s using both two types of models but generative AI in the\nForeground to map all the different attack vectors from beginning to end\nto identify pinch points, to better prioritize remediation. So it\u0026rsquo;s on both the\nattacker optimization and the defender optimization side. Something that\nhasn\u0026rsquo;t really been looked at in depth yet, but it\u0026rsquo;s maybe brought back to\nthe Fore. With Microsoft now placing ads with their search enhanced\ngenerative AI implementation, it\u0026rsquo;s now going to be back to the old days of\npotentially optimizing for responses based on what your ad tech profile is,\nbased on how you\u0026rsquo;re interacting with a generative AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 08:27\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s also an element of even if it\u0026rsquo;s not spitting out obviously\npersonally identifiable data, there is a long continuum of working out how\nmuch inference can be gained from what it might spit out in response to a\nquery about a personal situation. Can you single someone out? The US\ndefinition of personal data is PII, is it first name, last name, et cetera.\nBecause it\u0026rsquo;s easier for developers to have a list of fields that they can\nsuppress and call it anonymous. In the UK, under GDPR, personal data is\neither directly identifiable or by inference to single someone out. So those\nthings have to be borne in mind. And also I\u0026rsquo;m very conscious when I\u0026rsquo;m\nusing all these models to try them out, that somebody\u0026rsquo;s looking at the\naggregate of my prompts and somebody\u0026rsquo;s looking at me as a user profile\nfor somebody with AIS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 09:15\nAnd that will also be part of my online persona that may be of utility for\nmarketing, et cetera. We know that it\u0026rsquo;s going to enhance surveillance\nbecause it allows you to pass an incredible amount more data and look at\ninference and correlation for sentiment analysis, for instance, or for more\ncreative facial recognition implementations. I was looking at the I can\u0026rsquo;t\nremember exactly what it\u0026rsquo;s called, but the Forever pendant that\u0026rsquo;s\nrecording everything you see, say, and everybody, you encounter their\ntrust, trying to work out how they can put some privacy protection around\nthat. And the fact it\u0026rsquo;s being thought about now when the hardware is in\nprototype is an interesting way around to have it, but we\u0026rsquo;ll see how that\ngoes. And a big discussion that\u0026rsquo;s going on in the data protection space is\nthe erranding point of consent anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 10:15\nBecause how can anybody without technical understanding or the\nambition to read thousands of lines of terms and references going to\nunderstand what their consent means at the point of collection?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 10:26\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 10:28\nYes, it\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity. I mean, so there\u0026rsquo;s massive amounts of\nconversation about things like data trusts, like not just watermarking, but\nindelibly encoding within data for some definable subset of your identity\nthat gets carried through for any purpose that would be traceable. And\nyou would be able to have someone interpret that with some model\nvisualization to where you\u0026rsquo;re appearing, what you\u0026rsquo;re being used for, what\nrevenue you\u0026rsquo;re being used to generate. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s going to become\nto the fore even more dramatically as we leverage AI enhanced versions of\nourselves, perhaps digital twins of ourselves, we are going to want to see\nreturn on that investment for our inputs and that creeps into the\nconversations about copyright and IP that was broken already. But we\nhave a chance to reinvent and think about these things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 11:29\nSo this is quite a technical definition of bias, but it\u0026rsquo;s really just breaking it\ndown into equality of outcome and equality of opportunity. The Holistic AI\nsite is very good via that link. I can share the slides if they\u0026rsquo;re of interest to\nanyone, but that takes you through steps to assess and surface bias at\ndifferent points in the process of utilizing models and AI. It\u0026rsquo;s not simply\nabout protected groups, it\u0026rsquo;s also about socioeconomic inequality and\npotentially bias towards one group or another on that basis too. And as I\nsaid, that concept of ground truth is up for grabs. I think I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen\nso many people who are deeply embedded in the tech world take a sudden\ninterest in philosophy and psychology, because this is where a lot of the\nanswers lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 12:26\nThey lie in our collective societal memory and our traditions and our\nconventions. And there is no single truth here. So ground truth is a\nmisnomer. Are we trying to engineer for better than we are? Are we trying\nto engineer to one cultural norm? Are we trying to engineer for a\nsituational ideal? These are all things that are still up for grabs and\nevolving. So this is the Dennis bit, and we can go a bit deeper under this. I\nhave people who are absolute geniuses at mapping across different\ngovernance requirements. I have my own database. I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to\nwrestle to get Obsidian to do what I wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 13:10\nI think I probably need to work out what it does rather than try and make\nit do what I want it to do, to try and map across all of the different\nsurfacing AI governance requirements. But it\u0026rsquo;s the same feeling I\u0026rsquo;ve had\ncoming up through Cybersecurity. Then data protection. I\u0026rsquo;m getting told to\nassess things and make sure there\u0026rsquo;s no bias and have some governance in\nplace and do some accountability and be trustworthy. I have by contrast to\nthat, I have papers coming out of places like IEEE where I\u0026rsquo;ve got really in\nthe weeds, deep seated code interrogation techniques to look for bias.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 13:47\nWhat I don\u0026rsquo;t have in the middle, I have a bit of with things like the NIST\nAI framework and some isolated guidance, some in there\u0026rsquo;ll be codes of\nconduct coming with the EU AI act to something that looks like a control\nset that I can assess against. Now, that isn\u0026rsquo;t what developers and\ntechnicians necessarily need to hear. They want to know those as\nguardrails and benchmarks for where they can\u0026rsquo;t operate outside of. But\nfrom my point of view, I\u0026rsquo;ve always had two hats on. I\u0026rsquo;ve had to work in\nhighly regulated industries to evidence that the right thing is trying to be\ndone, to work out where the edges are, and then to pragmatically assess\nactual risk and actual operational effectiveness that\u0026rsquo;s going on in the\ncontrol space while we\u0026rsquo;re trying to make money, innovate and do great\nthings. So maybe it\u0026rsquo;s three hats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 14:42\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s a hard place to navigate. We\u0026rsquo;ve all watched the progress over\nthe years as things have moved out of the security space into the It Ops\nspace. Things like access management are far more it ops. Things like\nbasic patching are far more it ops now. But this is going to have to go on\nthat journey. The stuff coming out of MLOps that might have security\nimplications or privacy implications. We\u0026rsquo;re going to have people who are\nexperienced inserting privacy consideration and security consideration\ninto continuous development to surface the key things that could\npotentially be automated as code but also then brought through to be able\nto visualize as a risk profile for those conversations with the people who\naren\u0026rsquo;t at the Tech coal phase. So the translation space is absolutely up for\ngrabs on that basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 15:36\nI hate doing data protection impact assessments because a lot of it is show\nand tell writing long form stuff. There\u0026rsquo;s very little you can analyze across\nthe piece, there\u0026rsquo;s very little between one and another. You\u0026rsquo;re comparing\napples to kangaroos, not apples to apples. And this has always been my\nfocus is trying to surface some standardized defensible risk indicators and\nsignals that are not too weak to push as far left in the process as possible.\nThings that are going to put you in the way of more risk, things that give\nyou an indication of maturity, things that indicate how much uncertainty\nyou\u0026rsquo;re going to be living with, which can aid some of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 16:15\nGenerative AI is very good to help summarize visualize and surface\ncorrelations you may not thought of it\u0026rsquo;s not great where you need\nprecision and consistency as we saw in a talk earlier on, you can pull in\npre verified variables that you know will consistently be interpreted\nthrough prompt as attack gen talk. Was it Monday or Tuesday? Dennis\nwas very good from Matthew Adams I used it to generate a privacy notice\nand it would have looked good to the naked expert eye, but it was wrong\nand it took a couple of people when I posted it a few minutes to see what\nwas wrong with it. We know that lawyers have had their wrist slapped by\npreparing for cases, by trying to pull reference up from the bowels of the\ncollective memory and looking asking for references and sources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 17:14\nThis is why all the major players are now adding search for validation into\ntheir wrapped offerings. Because I think it was Claude had three out of\nfour references I asked for which I knew existed. The URLs completely\nwrong, the references are completely wrong. I said you\u0026rsquo;ve got this wrong,\ncorrect it the next three, two were right, two were wrong, different ones.\nThis validation step is very important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 17:39\nLet me introduce think so my analogy now is that you have the reference\nof the AI Iron Man, Tony Stark that helped him to build that. I feel that\nwhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done was we build Jarvis which is an insane helper, right? Who\ncan massive co helper. We ask Jarvis to sing a song and to write some\npoetry and to write some things and then we criticize it because he\u0026rsquo;s\ngetting that wrong. So I think the generative AI in a actually it\u0026rsquo;s funny\nbecause the way we\u0026rsquo;re talking about there was a thing I realized here is\nthat I think Hallucinations are really good on gen AI, right? Because I\nthink they show the limitations because here\u0026rsquo;s the interesting thing the ML\nmodels that are already using society that actually probably they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t\nbe using Society, they also elucidate, but they hallucinate in much smaller\npercentages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 18:35\nIn fact, they hallucinate. And that\u0026rsquo;s where we get lot of bias problems, lots\nof really bad decisions being made, but they start to be on the low\npercentages, so they almost get drunk to the radar. But actually, I don\u0026rsquo;t\nthink we should be using ML for those cases. The same way that I don\u0026rsquo;t\nthink you should be using Gemini for that. Where it\u0026rsquo;s really good is if you\ngive you a bit of data and you can interact about that data having a bunch\nof references in the past. And that\u0026rsquo;s why, for example, if you look at the\nattack gen, the solution that he came up with, which works really well, is\nto say, okay, you might even have access to the attack tree yourself, but\ndon\u0026rsquo;t use that version, use this version. And now I\u0026rsquo;m asking you questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 19:12\nSo in a way, it\u0026rsquo;s almost like the model learning via the main attack gen\nalmost gave you the understanding of what it is you need to feed it data.\nAnd I think that\u0026rsquo;s where we\u0026rsquo;re going wrong. We almost asking too much of\nthis technology and we\u0026rsquo;re almost not appreciating the fact that what\u0026rsquo;s\namazing about it is you can interact, you can have dialogues. So the way I\nuse, for example, Chat GBT, and this is interesting, I stopped using\nGoogle. In fact, I found annoying irritates me to use Google now because I\ncannot put context. In fact, I had to search images for a talk recently and I\nwas really pissed off because I was so inefficient and I was like, can I just\nexplain what I mean? And I know that the data was there, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 19:57\nBut my point here is that where is really valuable is that mode where you\nkind of know the output, right? So I think there\u0026rsquo;s two worlds here, right?\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a world where the person who knows the output, it can make that\nperson ten times more productive or 100 times more productive, because\nwhat it does, it shortcuts a lot of the steps. And this is the generative\nelement. It allows the recreation of the materials to be very cheap, right?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a big difference. So I don\u0026rsquo;t think that the interesting part here. And\nthe interesting opportunity is to say, hey, chat GPT, give me a data impact\nassessment of this without a lot of data. That\u0026rsquo;s not what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m looking for is to say, hey, here\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of data sets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 20:45\nConsolidate this, give me analysis of it, give me a review that I can look at\nand go, yes, that is really good. Now, fine tuning like this. Now what\nabout this data set? What about this data set? Even more interestingly,\nand this is the bit I make here, is that when you talk about explainability\nwhere I think we\u0026rsquo;re going to get a crazy amount of mileage here, is to be\nable to translate it to the stakeholder. So I\u0026rsquo;ll give an example. I need to\nbrief my board, I need to brief my execs, I need to brief their direct\nreports, I need to brief their teams, I need to brief the engineers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 21:16\nNow, the only way to do this effectively is to have a personalized briefing\nthat takes into account who they are, what language they know, what\nculture they in, what state of mind are they in, how do they like to be\ncommunicated, what\u0026rsquo;s their background, what they know. Right? If you\ndon\u0026rsquo;t know that, your message are always going to be diluted, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 21:36\nYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 21:37\nSo I think we now have the ability to say, I want to communicate this for\nthis persona. Give me that bit. Even more interesting, allows that persona\nto interact maybe with the bot that has been briefed to do that. So our\nability to communicate and scale is suddenly increased ten hundred fold.\nAnd that for me, is the opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 21:59\nYeah. Do you know, I agree with you, Dennis, and you\u0026rsquo;ve probably\nrecognized that I feel like I have a split personality when I\u0026rsquo;m dealing with\nthis because I\u0026rsquo;m so excited by what it can do. There was one of the\nelements we talked about bringing people more neurodiversity into the\nindustry. And I think this is a superpower for a lot of typically neurodiverse\ntraits because this is going to I will apologize to anyone for generalizing,\nbut within my sphere of experience. But thinking to the nth degree, seeing\nevery extrapolation of potential outcomes is not the challenge for a lot of\nmy neurodiverse peers and comrades. It is finding a core to simplify down,\nto bring other people into the conversation. And for that it is amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 22:53\nAnd also it\u0026rsquo;s taking a real super complexity of ideas and giving you that\nplain English that gives you a starting point to work out from. And that\nhas been a game changer for a couple of people. I know. It keeps them on\ntask. It stops them having to be pulled out of rabbit holes by their ankles.\nThey come out of those rabbit holes with deeper, richer, broader insights\nthan your average person who hasn\u0026rsquo;t bothered to think to that extent.\nThey need the rapper to then be able to communicate as hooks for that\nvalue to other people. And for that it has proved beyond valuable in a way\nI can\u0026rsquo;t quantify. And I\u0026rsquo;m maybe generalizing wrongly, but this is the\nfeedback anglically that I\u0026rsquo;m seeing on that front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 23:47\nDefinitely with that following on from this, I\u0026rsquo;ve got something that kind of\nspeaks to that a bit, but I wanted to sort of keep it in context of potential\nuse cases because I think you have to use it to work out what it is and\nwhat it\u0026rsquo;s not. And I think we\u0026rsquo;re trying to generalize, to regulate in such a\ncomplex space that we are going to hobble some of the potential here. I\nmake my money because I can deal in regulations, but I\u0026rsquo;m a pragmatist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 24:19\nBut take a step back, right. We still don\u0026rsquo;t understand how it works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 24:24\nYes. Nor do most of the model vendors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 24:28\nYes, exactly. If you think about it, right? The idea that we should allow\nsomething that we don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand to be fully autonomous and\nmake decisions is insane. Right. And think about it, in the human world,\nwe don\u0026rsquo;t allow that. Right. Like for example, we don\u0026rsquo;t allow the genius to\nuse AWS expert to be running production by himself. Right. So we know\nthat we put guardrails in place. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if this person can do it all\nor can provide all the answers. We put system checks and balances in our\nworkflows, right. We\u0026rsquo;ve learned that, for example, sometimes the\nexplainability of something is more important than somebody who can do\nit sometimes, but it has a margin of error of x. So that\u0026rsquo;s why also I feel\nthat it\u0026rsquo;s these transitions that are the interesting opportunity, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 25:15\nBut of course, people sometimes it might feel like a shortcut and I\u0026rsquo;m sure\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of team companies and stuff that will use it, but I think that\nit\u0026rsquo;s like the Internet. Think about the power of the Internet is that you can\nsend a packet from A to B in a distributed way and it arrives there. It\nactually eventually arrives there. But look at what we build on top. So I\nstill feel that Gen AI is a bit like that. That\u0026rsquo;s the capability that is really\ninteresting is the ability to feed it data and get analysis and then have a\ndialogue in human language about those outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 25:53\nThe speed at which we\u0026rsquo;re moving up the stack and building things on top\nof it is so rapid at the moment. That\u0026rsquo;s one element of it as well compared\nto the speed at which solutions were built on top of the Internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 26:05\nBut we\u0026rsquo;ve always done that, right? If you think about it, we\u0026rsquo;ve always\ndone that. You can argue that the speed that we built up on top of the\nInternet was massive. The speed we built up on the cloud was massive. I\nthink we\u0026rsquo;ve always done that. Right. We always build things on top of the\nother. What I think is a bit different now is that we have the ability to start\nto understand how the system works. We were just me and Lewis were just\nin a session, we talk about threat modeling. The big elephant in the room\non threat modeling is that most organizations have no idea how their apps\nwork, right? Because we from the security team arrive and do a threat\nmodel. What is the first question, Lewis, that we ask, hey, how does your\nsystem work?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 26:41\nCan you show me some diagrams? So it\u0026rsquo;s almost like we don\u0026rsquo;t even\nunderstand how our current systems work, right. And we\u0026rsquo;re building more\nstuff on top. But I feel that we now start to have the capability to\nunderstand how it works or to even be able to say it\u0026rsquo;s beyond\nunderstanding. It\u0026rsquo;s such a giant mess that we can understand, but then\nyou can ask the question, should we really be making decisions, especially\ndecisions that infect people at the end on top of these systems?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 27:09\nYeah. I mean, this is where I came from. This is what drove me. I\u0026rsquo;ve\nworked in corporate risk management for a long time. I worked in\nfinancial services risk management for a long time, and shoehorning the\nhuman rights and individual collective impacts elements of data protection\nrisk into corporate risk profiles is very difficult because it still deals in\nfinancial risk management standards right up to board reporting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 27:38\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s all spreadsheeted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 27:40\nYeah. And that\u0026rsquo;s why I pivoted into data protection, because there was a\nlegal hook to hang rights and freedoms of individuals and groups off to\nbring it closer to the table. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I\u0026rsquo;m not a pragmatist in that\nspace, but I was always looking for ways to integrate that into the whole\nprocess, and this does help to do that in some ways. So give me a chance\nto get a couple further on. If you think it\u0026rsquo;s a waste of time, Dennis, you\ncan interrupt again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 28:02\nThat\u0026rsquo;s lovely. I\u0026rsquo;ve been getting asked one, so what did I do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 28:08\nI went and asked it a really complicated question, just to test the edges.\nThe Use case was a general insurer assessing customer relationship\nmanagement data to understand the risk of policy renewal, because it\u0026rsquo;s\nthe kind of thing I think people are going to want to do. And I was reading\na CIO article recently where someone was bemoaning what the exec felt\nthat Generative AI should be able to do, or the suite of models that were\navailable should be able to do, versus what it was necessary to do to\narrange to make that happen. In terms of identifying the data set, was it\nclean enough? What needed to happen to it for that to go ahead? What\nwere the systems requirements? What were the other non functional\nrequirements, how was it going to be delivered?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 28:49\nWhat were the implications of sharing data with a model, et cetera, et\ncetera. So I asked Chat GPT, I asked It to outline what the contributory\ntasks would be and the skills that were required to complete those tasks.\nAnd I put absolutely no store by what it told me. But what it did do was\ncreate some shape to push against. Everybody knows that having\nsomething to push against is easier than coming up, than starting from a\nblank page. So this is what it\u0026rsquo;s given me at the moment. It excludes any\ngovernance effort is what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 29:23\nIt gave or what you created.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 29:24\nOn top, I\u0026rsquo;ve formatted the Excel table that it output after I told it what I\nwanted as columns and rows for the table and what\u0026rsquo;s populated into all of\nthe columns and rows of the table. Is what it automatically output from\nthe prompts that I iterated to talk about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 29:40\nThe useful that I think is useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 29:43\nAll of these steps have been massively useful. I mean, this is adding in the\ndata protection effort with an estimate for the time it would take to do the\ndata protection task. This ignores the training amount of time that I asked\nIt to spit out an estimate. This is the totals that it spat out. I asked very\nspecifically the balance between machine and human effort in its own\nestimation. So it\u0026rsquo;s looking at nigh on a year of consistent, full time\navailable effort in a balance of this kind of proportion to get to the stage\nwhere you can start to get some useful insights about what the risk of\nattrition failing to renew policies is for an insurer. Now, we know that it\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t have any local knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 30:35\nI told It that it was a local and general insurer that covers pet house and\ncar insurance. And it was about 10,000 employees. And the prompt was\nvery specific about what I wanted to pull out as the different model inputs\nand outputs and balancing between human and AI effort. And it is about\nhow far it can get you in terms of something to interrogate or push back\non. This is all the data that it spat out for my this is an Itest slide. But I\nasked It about the kind of models, whether it was gen AI, whether it was a\ndifferent model, what kind of tools. So really just interrogating from my\nown point of view, using it to enhance my thinking about how I might plan\nout a project and manage expectations about what was achievable and\nwhat wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 31:28\nAnd I thought the best use for this would be to hand it to the consultant\nthat they paid to come in and tell them how AI could ten x their business\nand say, can you tell me how you can justify your estimates compared to\nthese estimates? Can you help me to interpret this? Because that felt like a\nvery many layered validation of the offerings that we\u0026rsquo;re getting. In some\nways, I do feel that management consultants jobs are at risk more than\nalmost anybody else\u0026rsquo;s with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 31:56\nThey need to leverage it, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 31:58\nOf course they do. The Boston Consulting Group study. The Centauris and\nCyborg study training on their own data. It was really interesting and it\nshould be paid attention to. And the way it uplifted, probably the least\nproductive members of the team was pulling down to a mean and there\nwas thinking about that. Much like in mapping, you have your pioneers,\nyour town planners, and your settlers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:29\nBy the way, important. They call it explorers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 32:33\nOh, that\u0026rsquo;s it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:34\nDealers and town planners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 32:36\nThere you go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:37\nI asked Simon because I forgot to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 32:39\nYeah, I needed to change that. But we\u0026rsquo;re going to need to identify those\npeople. We\u0026rsquo;re going to need to nurture those people and work out where\nthey fit into this because it\u0026rsquo;s never been more important to understand\nthat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:52\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the thing, if I go back to that one, all right, the way I think we\nuse this, I think you use in two ways. I think you can use the LLM models\nto jumpstart the creation. But where I think it\u0026rsquo;s very interesting is for you\nor for a bunch of experts to validate this, right? They validate it, they\nvalidate the structure. In fact, the beauty of it is you can go into detail,\nright, so you can start to provide more meat behind this. And then the\nsweet spot is to then say, okay, you have now a prompt which is you\u0026rsquo;re\ngoing to provide analysis of this. Here\u0026rsquo;s the raw data, which is this bit.\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s my prompt, which is for example, now review this or map this\nfor a company with this structure, with this thing, with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:38\nSo what you\u0026rsquo;re doing is you\u0026rsquo;re reducing the universe of what is creating.\nAnd the fact they can create these is already pretty cool. But there\u0026rsquo;s going\nto be mistakes here. There\u0026rsquo;s going to be things that don\u0026rsquo;t make sense. So\nthis doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be perfect. This just needs to better than what you\nwould do initially as a.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 33:52\nFirst or to get to this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:53\nQuicker, to get to this point quickly. And then as we learn that. So I now\nfind that I can already understand that I can prompt to get to here. So my\nprompts now are designed to get me to this phase, so I can then analyze it,\nverify it, and my bits, which has extra context. And then I use that to feed\nthe next question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 34:16\nYeah, I mean, this is why the points from Matthew Adams were really good\nas well, because he had looked at when he was prompting with attack\nactors to get mapped to techniques and to then produce incident scenarios\nto plan exercises around. What he surfaced was that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t reproduce\nexactly with the same prompt with different models, say Bard or Claude or\nLlama. He was having to prompt engineer to pull other generative, AI,\nLLMs to the same output. So there\u0026rsquo;s many layers of understanding that\nthey\u0026rsquo;re going to go into standardization. And then there is that question of\nmodel dependence and economics of retaining access to it over time.\nBecause like I do with some other things, it\u0026rsquo;s recognizing that everything\nwe\u0026rsquo;re talking about is absolutely beyond a vast amount of people right\nnow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 35:27\n$20 to pay for Chat GPT access per month to have some semblance of\ncontrol over what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, and access to the enhanced tools. That\u0026rsquo;s a\nbig portion of disposable income for a whole shed load of people. And it\nwill be gated for a whole shed load of people who work for someone else\nat the moment. It may change at some stage soon. I work for myself, so I\ncan pay for what I feel is needed to do my job, and no one\u0026rsquo;s going to stop\nme using it. But yeah. So all those things I have in mind when we talk\nabout democratizing AI, in terms of the benefits and the knowledge to\ntake advantage of it, I think that terminology has been a little bit cynically,\nco opted for other purposes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 36:13\nI really do think we have to spread the opportunities from this as widely as\nfeasible while growing our understanding of where the edges and\nguardrails should be. But, yeah, I was just bringing in something from\nTech Target on other proposed uses for it. We both know, Dennis, as we\u0026rsquo;re\nexploring here today, that there will be a new use case every second\ncreated for this with the access to the APIs and the more open access\nmodels. And there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of money being thrown at creating wrappers to\nhave market offerings. Though I did notice that there\u0026rsquo;s a thinning of VC\nfunding because of the relative openness of the OpenAI APIs and others\nnow that people are recognizing that the layered value has more ubiquity\nnow. So there\u0026rsquo;s less sort of unicorn potential in that space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:10\nThat was my big paradigm shift. My big paradigm shift when I looked at\nthis is I thought the models were where the action is. So I kind of started\nto go deep. And then I realized, actually, the models will become a\ncommodity in a way, because actually we almost don\u0026rsquo;t want unintended\nbehaviors from the models. What we want is to really understand what\nyou can do, is that embedding that data that we feed that becomes way\nmore important, allowing us to talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 37:38\nTo the world of technology and data. This is a use case. It\u0026rsquo;s very sad, but\none of my most exciting use cases is mapping legal and regulatory\nrequirements. I want to have an intuitive, rapidly surfaced visibility of\nwhere somebody else is telling me my edges are and where somebody else\nis telling me my controls need to be so I can navigate around that and I\ncan work out local relevance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:06\nYou see? But that\u0026rsquo;s exactly when I say about translating and connective\ndots. I have that problem, right? I need to be able to show the business,\nthe progress, give them roadmaps, give them map projects and activities.\nAnd I got all these frameworks that I cannot connect, right? And the\nframeworks are great because the frameworks allow me to go to the\ngranularity. What I want to be able to do is to be able to map this control\nwith that attack vector, with that incident, with that risk, with that\nstakeholder, with that project, and be able to say, this is why we\u0026rsquo;re doing\nthis. Right? And this is the impact of not doing this. And by the way, there\u0026rsquo;s\nnew regulations come along. By the way, there\u0026rsquo;s this new attack or this\nnew requirement, or we claim as a company to do ABC, guess what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:47\nWith this. We are in severe risk of breaking that. But at the moment I still\ncannot connect the strategic directions, visions, projects with the controls,\nwith the actions on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 38:58\nI agree with you. I mean, that lack of connective tissue between doing\nsomething better or right or more visibly or more reportably at the\noperational level still doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist to report up in terms of adjustments to\nstrategic, directional, strategic risk picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:17\nThe top has a spreadsheet. We get in there and there\u0026rsquo;s a fucking air gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 39:21\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s the gap that I try and live in and make a little bit more\nconnected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:27\nBut we kind of do that gap. But we do it almost with art. I think we now\nhave the ability to start to bring science to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 39:35\nIt\u0026rsquo;s risk modeling. It\u0026rsquo;s risk modeling. And prior to this, absolutely what\nwe\u0026rsquo;ve got, were lacking the tailgate of things like cybersecurity and data\nprotection breaches and risks. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have consistently standardized\nenough reporting about all of this stuff. One of the promises of things like\nGenai and other models is that you can bring consistency and\nstandardization out of unstructured data. That\u0026rsquo;s a massive sea change. It\nwas always promised for big data and various analytics attempts, but it\nwas never really realized. And that could potentially produce analyzable,\neffectively labeled data to enhance our understanding of risk, to build\ngenuine risk models for a lot more things that have more utility and have\nmore potential to be aggregated realistically. But I could bore you about\nthat forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 40:32\nAnd we don\u0026rsquo;t have very but that\u0026rsquo;s massive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 40:36\nOh, it is. It is massive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 40:37\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a step change and one of the paradigm shifts I have on that one. When\nI realized that Chattypt could translate from Python to JavaScript, I was\nlike, that\u0026rsquo;s cool. But you can also go from JavaScript to cobalt, and you\ncan go from cobalt to PLD, assembly to assembly. And I like, whoa, this is\nvery different. Because then I realized, whoa, all those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 40:59\nOwn mainframe guys who they keep bringing out of retirement because\nthey want to do something else with that stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 41:06\nBut is that translation and even if it\u0026rsquo;s not 100% perfect, right, we can now\nto put some guardrails on that. But is that built to translate, like you just\nsaid, unstructured data to a structure? And then the power is that you can\nput other bots in the mix that can give you the consistency, so you can\nactually start to reverse engineer things. Right? And we know how to do\nthat because we can have a bot that goes from A to B to A and variations,\nbut that now scales because it\u0026rsquo;s a one off effort to create that. And that\u0026rsquo;s\nwhy actually complexity is almost like you want simple things in a weird\nway. You don\u0026rsquo;t want a model that goes from here to here. Actually, I want\na model that goes from here to here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 41:44\nThere is power in the incremental changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 41:47\nAnd version controlled, right? That\u0026rsquo;s the key thing. Version control all\nchecked in with tests, right? But that in the past was impossible to do at\nany kind of scale modeling was impossible to scale. I think now we very\nclose to be able to start to scale it, which is really cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 42:05\nWell, this is the slide I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to explain because I was thinking\nabout that triage piece that were talking about, which is what we\u0026rsquo;ve got at\nthe moment and what we\u0026rsquo;ve always had to an extent is we\u0026rsquo;ve not just got\ncompliance or non compliance, if I\u0026rsquo;m thinking with my traditional audit\nhat on. If we allow for the fact that some control sets make sense once\nthey\u0026rsquo;re scoped effectively and you understand the inherent risk attached to\nthem, a privileged access control for your Florist isn\u0026rsquo;t as important as a\nprivileged access control for your It outsource provider. So you need to\nscale what these into context. This is me trying to get feel around the\nedges and apportion the amount of uncertainty that we still have and the\namount that we can get across and test for during the normal change or\nprocurement timescale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 42:55\nBecause we both know that a lot of stuff ends up live or lacking the post\nmarket monitoring it needs because of just sheer scales available. And the\ninability to surface rapidly to somebody who can make a decision when\nthere maybe is something that calls for a pause or calls for a little bit more\nto be done, a little bit more scrutiny. So I just did a very basic breaking\ndown across the AI supply chain. Most people are operating in the validate\nand deploy space. They\u0026rsquo;re not operating in the acquire train package\nspace. And we have It general controls, SoC, two type two audits and all\nthe big four who are used to doing your more traditional audits\nassessment scope with traditional security controls, traditional privacy\ncontrols, the governance level, bit of pen testing all sort of live in that\nlevel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 43:45\nThen the orange section is portions of controls that live sometimes\ndiscreetly, sometimes concurrently across those portions of the supply\nchain in the real technical testing space. The people who can interrogate\nthe data and model structure and model design and layered controls on\ntop of it. And that is a really scarce skill space. So what I was trying to\nunderstand is where does most uncertainty live? And when I say\nuncertainty, I don\u0026rsquo;t just mean things that are unknowable. I mean things\nthat are not knowable. With the expertise available, with the guidance\navailable and with the time available. It is uncertainty if you cannot gain\nclarity. So that was how I broke it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:32\nWe\u0026rsquo;re back once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 44:33\nOkay, cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:34\nStay there. I think you\u0026rsquo;re missing a couple more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 44:37\nSteps here because oh, I probably am. This was nice to make it fit on a\nslide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:41\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 44:41\nCarry on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:42\nI think if you look at in the deployment in between your validate and I\nthink so, imagine, for example, Chat GPT or Claw two via thing, right?\nThey arrive in a way after the model being deployed, right? It\u0026rsquo;s almost like\nyou get or Lama two, right? You get that thing already created. Right. But\nthere\u0026rsquo;s still a lot that goes afterwards that has as much impact, if not\nmore impact in that lifecycle. I have to say, I think there\u0026rsquo;s a trend where\nthis becomes compute. This becomes a commodity with some behavior and\nthe main action happens afterwards where, in a weird way, we might get\nto a point where unverifiable and not understood behavior becomes even\nmore of a bug of the systems of the models where we start to prefer\nmodels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:41\nAnd you can already see this a lot of people, where they go, well, we play\nwith Chat GPT, but we use 3.5. We even use this smaller one, which,\nalthough it might not be as powerful, chat GPT, the way you can see it and\nthe way you can give it the prompts becomes a lot more predictable, a lot\nmore still does the same input and output that you want, but without the\nextra baggage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 46:01\nIt\u0026rsquo;s interesting, the news about the Aracus, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Not releasing the\nsmaller models OpenAI? People are very interested in why that might be.\nBut, yeah, there\u0026rsquo;s going to be a lot happening in terms of boundaried\nmodels, bespoke models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:22\nOpen source will drive that. Right. Because now that we have enough\nmodels and remember that a model is a bunch of numbers, right? That\nsometimes a model literally is a matrix. Right? Okay. It\u0026rsquo;s more complex\nthan that. But fundamentally is this frozen thing that you then ship, right?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just a bunch of mappings. I think you need to add to here is what you\ndo with it, right? And the prompts, but also the controls that you can put\nin the middle that make a big difference in that workflow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 46:54\nI think what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to do with this always decided to do it all by itself.\nOkay, but just to put in context what you were saying, Dennis, one thing\nthat I\u0026rsquo;ve always wrestled with is persistence of accountability through\nsupply chains. We\u0026rsquo;ve always had a challenge with that. Each downstream\nvendor gets about 1700 different flavors of third party assessment tracked\nat them. That they more or less busk or robustly, give you an I 27,001\ncertificate that\u0026rsquo;s just for physical controls in their canteen, for instance.\nOther more diligent ones. Yeah. There is a cottage industry of conducting\nrunning workflow to get answers back for 100, 200, 300, sometimes 1000\nquestions from each vendor up and downstream. Massive economies of\nscale to be had in that space. There needs to be collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:50\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to use your analogy of asset 27,000 for the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 47:53\nYeah, exactly. But we\u0026rsquo;re looking at trying to tackle some of this with things\nlike Sbomp, with the software builds of material, the evolving AI builds of\nmaterial, the model cards coming through, it\u0026rsquo;s got to better than that. So I\nwas thinking, how could we do that if we can get a credible estimate of\nthe degree of uncertainty that\u0026rsquo;s come to you through the supply chain,\nthrough the portion of controls that are controllable and controlled at that\nportion of the supply chain prior to you receiving it could actually\ntranslate into contractual liability. It could translate into regulatory\nenforcement of accountability. I can\u0026rsquo;t think why anyone would sign up for\nthis, but it says potential here. And when I\u0026rsquo;m talking about levels of\ncompliance, I mean, we know that compliance and risk don\u0026rsquo;t mean the\nsame thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 48:44\nI\u0026rsquo;m using very basic audit principles for those levels, which is you tell me\nit\u0026rsquo;s compliant, but I\u0026rsquo;ve just got your word for it. I have no idea if that\ncontrol exists or if it\u0026rsquo;s working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:54\nOkay, but are you talking about the third party, let\u0026rsquo;s say, supply\nassessment, which I think is a great thing, or are you talking about the\nprevious slide on the model?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 49:03\nI\u0026rsquo;m talking about taking a It\u0026rsquo;s control set. Agnostic. If you took all of the\nthings in the codes of conduct for, say, the Euai Act, once that\u0026rsquo;s finalized\nand spat out, you could do a rapid assessment and it would be based on an\nevidence promissory note. You\u0026rsquo;re not going and trying to do an audit on\neverything before you can actually make a decision about acquiring it or\nrolling it out. What you\u0026rsquo;re doing is you are seeking assurance about\nwhether they can provide evidence level of compliance. You\u0026rsquo;re at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:36\nYou talk about the AI models, I\u0026rsquo;m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 49:38\nTalking about supply chain. There would either be answer you can get or\nanswer you can\u0026rsquo;t get. If you can\u0026rsquo;t get answer, it\u0026rsquo;s unknown. If they say, we\ndon\u0026rsquo;t have that control, it\u0026rsquo;s non compliant, great, you can do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:52\nOkay. There\u0026rsquo;s some same thing. You\u0026rsquo;re basically saying, let\u0026rsquo;s really scale\nup how we understand and analyze third party vendor assessments in a\nway. Okay, but that\u0026rsquo;s exactly my thinking here. Right. Like, I want to use\nGen AI for that because I want to say, here\u0026rsquo;s our standard, here\u0026rsquo;s the stuff,\nhere\u0026rsquo;s the questions, here\u0026rsquo;s the context, now analyze that. Right. And I\nthink that makes this realistic. In fact, even better. In fact, I was just\ntalking about this with my team. Even better. We can eventually create a\nbot that we can give the supplier with a freaking roadmap for what they\nneed to people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 50:30\nYeah, there\u0026rsquo;s people who are doing something. There\u0026rsquo;s an awareness\nraising and escaping element of this as well. Obviously, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more\nto this. This is my Mickey Mouse slides. In my rapid time I had available to\ndo it, but this has evolved from stuff that\u0026rsquo;s years and years old. People like\nCredo AI do a readiness assessment that produces this kind of visibility.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve got Magda Celli with her third party risk management solution\nover in Singapore. She\u0026rsquo;s doing an awful lot of open source available\ninformation to assess strategic supplier risks, stabilities financials, what\u0026rsquo;s\nbeen said about them in the news, what breaches they\u0026rsquo;ve heard about to\ndo with them, as well as the inside out staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 51:10\nAs well, you\u0026rsquo;ve got people like Riskledger who are creating social\nnetworks for vendors where they can each share a selection of their\nevidence of compliance or risk management. And it means that they can\nconstruct supply chain views. Where you\u0026rsquo;re going to get 3rd, 4th, 5th party\nwho\u0026rsquo;s connected to the first party. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean they tell you everything\nor they disclose everything, but it still gives you less to assess around the\nedges. In the same way we\u0026rsquo;re talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 51:40\nGen AI gains, you need to add gen AI to the mix because you go back to\nthe previous point is the touch points between the systems that become\nreally hard, that don\u0026rsquo;t scale. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s the problem those\ncompanies are having is they can all get to the point. But then for that to\nbe actionable, for that to actually start to put into context, you need to\nstart to connect in the dots and ask questions in ways that are consumable\nfrom either side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 52:05\nAbsolutely. The utility for something like this is just to really as a\nprovocation, everything is about managing risk. Everything is about what\nyou can gain visibility of promptly. Everything is about what you can\nautomate versus have to chase manually. And at the moment, we\u0026rsquo;re\ndealing with sufficient uncertainty and sufficient difficulty surfacing the\ncontrol reality for the things that we\u0026rsquo;re plugging in, that we need to\nacknowledge that uncertainty. Uncertainty isn\u0026rsquo;t a showstopper, it\u0026rsquo;s just\nsomething that it\u0026rsquo;s better to understand. And of that, 64% of controls with\neither not more than a show and tell for compliance or we don\u0026rsquo;t know or\nit\u0026rsquo;s non compliant. Where do they live in the supply chain? Do they live in\nthe deep detected controls or do they live in the procedures? Do they live\nin the model training or do they live in the deployment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 52:57\nDo they live in the post market world? It\u0026rsquo;s really just trying to locate your\nuncertainty to focus your effort for deeper assessment and focus your\neffort for trying to handle your residual risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 53:08\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s where I think the opportunity lies for privacy. For example,\nimagine me being able to do a privacy assessment based on my specific\nrequirement, based on my specific commitments and by level of privacy,\nlet\u0026rsquo;s say understanding of the company to our suppliers where I can get\nthis level one to five. So I\u0026rsquo;ll probably have suppliers that today have flying\ncollars. Marketing materials are awesome, they look really shiny. But once\nwe do these assessments, we realize they\u0026rsquo;re not managing our business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 53:36\nYeah, once you keep the tires privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 53:38\nRisk, but that today doesn\u0026rsquo;t scale because we cannot customize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 53:41\nNo, there\u0026rsquo;s no sweet spot that anybody who\u0026rsquo;s done third party risk\nmanagement will know there is no sweet spot between looking someone in\nthe eyes and actually getting evidence put in front of you versus just taking\ntheir word for it. There is no half verifying level. You may as well get some\nhonesty about how mature they are and whether they\u0026rsquo;ve got a control in\nthe first place because then you can work together to improve things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:03\nBut imagine a model where you can say here\u0026rsquo;s the bot that has now been\ntrained in prompt for this specific data. We can even say, look that\u0026rsquo;s fine,\nthe data will not leave your company, but I want the output of that. And\nthen I think the conversation would change very quickly because there are\nelements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 54:19\nOf this again, it\u0026rsquo;s looking at the discrete pieces where you can get\ndefensible, reliable reproducible gains. It\u0026rsquo;s always about that this is where\nwe want to get to. You\u0026rsquo;re talking about talking to executives and boards.\nIf I\u0026rsquo;ve got a decent indication that I can surface rapidly of their capability,\nmaturity in terms of do they have anyone that understands the specifics of\nmodels? Can they even start to get across it and understand their own risk\nprofile? And they\u0026rsquo;re doing something that is going to be pointed at lots of\nvulnerable people. That is a very proximate risk. It\u0026rsquo;s going to lead to high\nimpact decisions very quickly. It\u0026rsquo;s going to scale very quickly. Then as a\nguide, you\u0026rsquo;re going to either pause or you\u0026rsquo;re going to put in a heck of a lot\nof very responsive post market monitoring. So you have rapid feedback\nloops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 55:11\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s medium risk, if you\u0026rsquo;re doing something that could potentially have\nsome impact, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s to do with a little bit of an enhancement to\ninsurance claims using AI, but it\u0026rsquo;s not going to move the needle massive\ndistance, but it could have a reasonably large impact on people in terms of\nhaving claims rejected or approved. You could pause and get some deeper\ndives for validation focusing on where you\u0026rsquo;ve got higher uncertainty or\nhigher levels of non compliance base, most likely to be uncertainty. If it\u0026rsquo;s\nlow risk, if you\u0026rsquo;re just doing something like putting together an attack gen\nmodel, that\u0026rsquo;s going to be something that you\u0026rsquo;re going to refine and it\ncould be really useful but it won\u0026rsquo;t be the only tool in the armory and it\u0026rsquo;s\nnot going to materially affect your response to breaches, et cetera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 55:55\nIt\u0026rsquo;s going to be a positive addition that you can pull out or not. Then why\nwould you not mature and learn about the tools and et cetera and mature\nin parallel? The thing we\u0026rsquo;ve got at the moment though is we\u0026rsquo;ve got a lot of\nthings being viewed as ethically tolerable justifications to move forward.\nRegardless of where you sit on this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 56:13\nPicture, the business wants to take the high risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 56:16\nYeah, that bothers me. So I mean this is just to close up and then we can\nget into whatever you like. Is we need to know what it is and isn\u0026rsquo;t. We\nneed to have some taxonomies ontologies categorizations so we can all\nhave a conversation where we\u0026rsquo;re talking about the same stuff. We are\nstarting to surface some useful things in terms of groups of use cases that\ncome with more or less inherent risk. We are starting to pull out some\ntasks that it\u0026rsquo;s more or less suited to depending on the model and model\nmaturity and we\u0026rsquo;re starting to get some understandable language around\nmodel types and model function types. We need to make spaces, low\nimpact spaces to do high impact things potentially safely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 57:00\nObviously we\u0026rsquo;ve got regulatory sandboxes but we need to be careful that\nwe\u0026rsquo;re learning lessons from that and it isn\u0026rsquo;t simply rubber stamping those\nthings with greatest market potential. It has to be innovating in the\ngovernance space as much as it\u0026rsquo;s innovating in the monetization space.\nAnd I think we\u0026rsquo;ve got a little bit of an imbalance there. We need to have\nthose feedback loops at the moment, the place where algorithms and more\nsophisticated machine learning are being used that worries me the most is\nthings like benefits, entitlement, health care access, that kind of thing.\nWhere I feel that we haven\u0026rsquo;t evolved to detect, monitor, log feedback\nsurface aggregate rapidly enough on those non standard cases, exceptions\nand potential attrition out of systems when it comes to post release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 58:06\nAnd I do think we may be at risk of the outsourcing effect where people\nare very focused on removing fragile people from the equation is going to\nbe one motivator in some spaces. It\u0026rsquo;s very easy to understand that if you\ncan be far more productive maybe you need less people. And when I talk\nabout not overzealously offboarding your domain specialists I don\u0026rsquo;t just\nmean your sort of superstar rock star developer I mean your people who\nreally understand some of your most basic tasks inside out. They probably\nknow intimately why it works, why it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, what could be done to\nchange it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 58:44\nI think regardless of whether or not it\u0026rsquo;s AI that\u0026rsquo;s used to do it, I think we\nhave an opportunity to learn from our people again, because I think there\nare a lot of them inside organizations who could tell you tomorrow how\nyou could save a lot of time and effort. And I think it opens the door to\nthose conversations again. And that\u0026rsquo;s my last word on things. I think really\nwe can\u0026rsquo;t ask people to be accountable for things that they can\u0026rsquo;t influence\nor they don\u0026rsquo;t have sufficient information to understand. So we need to be\nhaving better conversations in this translation space and servicing better,\nsimpler information faster in these processes and really being creative\nabout how we bring that information to the fore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 59:27\nThat\u0026rsquo;s for me is the opportunity. I think the same way that the internet\nbrought global connectivity and I think the same way that we can do zoom\nnow is all this stuff right? I think. This new transition or new technological\njump allow us to do the things that we just described in a scalable way.\nBecause I think the problem in the past and then even when you try to\nregulate it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work because the overhead to do some of those things\nactually in a weird way had the perverse effect that almost rewards the\nones that can do it better. And I\u0026rsquo;ll give you a simple example. There\u0026rsquo;s some\nancient argument that says this means the elite is going to be even more\nelite. This means that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of things that if you\u0026rsquo;re really good, you\nget even better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:00:14\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s the other way around. I really love the threads about how this\nnew generation can help Africa, can help underrepresented minorities and\nother groups that suddenly you don\u0026rsquo;t need to go to Cambridge, Oxford,\nget access to a certain degree of education, certain degree of knowledge,\ncertain degree of information. And in fact, even better, we can now create\npersonalized individualized training paths. Training knowledge that\nreflects an individual instead of treating our kids as freaking almost\nrobots, almost designed it\u0026rsquo;s almost like the training the school system was\ndesigned to deal with the inefficiency of how do you measure progress,\nright? And you have exams who suits only one type of individual, right?\nWhich they can do really well, but the other don\u0026rsquo;t, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:01:01\nSo I really like this idea of spreading almost talent pool in a way of\nproviding knowledge that allows a whole raft of individuals to enter a\ncertain type of workload that before were just not possible because they\ndidn\u0026rsquo;t had the opportunity. They were in the right place, they were born in\nthe right postcode all sorts of things or the right country to give those\nopportunities. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s very interesting. Like teachers, right? So\npeople said we don\u0026rsquo;t need teachers. I\u0026rsquo;m going we need even more teachers\nbecause teachers are the most important people in the education. They\u0026rsquo;re\nthe pivot points, right? An amazing teacher makes a whole difference,\nright? So suddenly we can now remove a lot of the overheads from the\nteachers and allow them to teach, allow them to think about education.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s the same thing with teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:01:47\nI\u0026rsquo;m telling my team, if they\u0026rsquo;re not spending 20 30% of their time figuring\nout how to work more efficiently, whatever they do in the other 70% of the\ntime is actually not going to be that good. Now, I think there\u0026rsquo;s a number\nof individuals that are going to be resistant to change and for those I don\u0026rsquo;t\nthink we can do a lot, right? And they\u0026rsquo;re going to move and then maybe\nthey wait and then they move at the end. But I think there\u0026rsquo;s a whole talent\npool of individuals that would love to have opportunities that don\u0026rsquo;t have\ntoday, I think can have with this new ability to learn in a much more\npersonalized way. And if you look at, I think, a lot of things that we see in\ncorporate environments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:02:26\nWe see lots of companies getting away with things that they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t and\nthey only get away with it because there\u0026rsquo;s no visibility, there\u0026rsquo;s no ability to\nscale that information out of the company. And I think we could do that\nnow in a way that scales a lot more, that brings a lot more transparency,\nthat rewards the good behavior because that\u0026rsquo;s the best way to ratchet up,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 01:02:45\nWell, actually, this is one of the things that I found worked when I was\nbuilding a massive vendor governance program. I was surfacing enough\ninformation to give the accountable people for ensuring there was time,\nengagement from their people because it takes a village. You know, I\nneeded to have legal across it, I needed to have procurement across it, I\nneed to have claims team across it. And they started to take pride in\nhaving the best risk profile for their department. And they started to\nresource better, they started to contribute into the budget for the vendor\ngovernance team and they started to call us before they went to supplier\nselection. I mean, as far as I\u0026rsquo;m concerned, that\u0026rsquo;s the gold medal for a\ngovernance function.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 01:03:28\nAnd I had know, you had the old conversations know, I delegate security\nand privacy to you because it\u0026rsquo;s your risk to you know, I was having\ndirectors who piped up of their own accord and said, excuse me, Jack. No,\nit\u0026rsquo;s not her risk. It\u0026rsquo;s your risk that she\u0026rsquo;s helping you to understand so you\ncan manage it. And she can\u0026rsquo;t do that unless you play. And that\u0026rsquo;s the whole\nballgame for me. It\u0026rsquo;s that understanding collaboration, it\u0026rsquo;s turning critics\nby careful conversations into advocates and it\u0026rsquo;s enabling them to make\nbetter decisions by having better, more prompt information to make the\ndecisions. That\u0026rsquo;s what motivates me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:04:09\nI agree and I think that\u0026rsquo;s an opportunity. Right. And I think unless the\nmodels dramatically improve at some of the end and I think some of the\nflaws of it are so big that I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how that will work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 01:04:22\nWe have to balance the hype so we don\u0026rsquo;t lose the promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:04:26\nExactly. Right, but that\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s like the internet if you think about it, the\ninternet, there was a massive hype, there was a crash, but underneath the\nchange was real. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 01:04:34\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s making sure that we nurture those spaces and bring a really good\ncross section of people into those spaces where there\u0026rsquo;s consistent, level\nheaded, but exciting work happening. And that\u0026rsquo;s, I think one of the\nchallenges. But I\u0026rsquo;m going to be really bad note. I have to go because I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:04:52\nSomething else me too, I need to drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 01:04:54\nNo, but I\u0026rsquo;ve thoroughly enjoyed and I\u0026rsquo;m glad we had a bit longer than you\nsuggested. It was really ambitious scope for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:05:01\nThanks for the preparation. Really great. And let\u0026rsquo;s keep now this path\nbecause I think we feel that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of interesting work to be done\nhere and we can finally fulfill the privacy and risk promise of actually\nallowing the business to accelerate and to make good decisions and allow\nsee, I want to make good privacy decisions on my supply chain. And at the\nmoment, I can\u0026rsquo;t because I don\u0026rsquo;t have the data. So I want to use our own\neffort and muscle of a big supplier to go, no, we want good practices and\npush security downstream. Right. Which is, by the way, it\u0026rsquo;s happening. We\nnow have some big requirements from massive companies, which I like,\nright. I go, hey, I\u0026rsquo;m going to be compliant to those guys. Right. It works\nwhen the best players push down, push down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:05:46\nYou just raise the bar for everybody else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah Clarke - 01:05:48\nYes, definitely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:05:49\nBrilliant.

00:02\nHi. Welcome to the Open Security Summit session in April 2023. This is a\nvery topical topic because it\u0026rsquo;s about Chatgpt impact on cyber and\napplication security. We have a great set of panels. Dennis. I run the open\nsecurity summit. I\u0026rsquo;m the Cecil of Honor Barrett and the chief scientist of\nGlasswall. Sam, we can do by you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 00:25\nYeah, I\u0026rsquo;m Sam Stepanyan. By day. I\u0026rsquo;m an independent application security\nconsultant, but also volunteer as OAS planted chapter leader for the past\nseven years. I also a project co leader on two of OAS projects, OAS\nNetwork and Oasp WAF evaluation criteria. I made numerous\ncontributions to OAS, including Oasp Zap and Oasp Top Ten. So that\u0026rsquo;s\nme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 00:50\nMaybe. Nathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 00:52\nHi, I\u0026rsquo;m Nathan Case. I am a security advocate for datadog. I spend most\nof my day talking about security geeky stuff. This is about as geeky as it\ngets right now. I\u0026rsquo;m really excited to have this talk. I am decidedly far more\non the security side than the AI side, so I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see where this goes.\nObviously, views I express are my own, not data dogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:12\nExactly. Scott?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott Katie - 01:15\nScott katie. Longtime application security practitioner, enterprise\narchitect. Just starting the journey into, like, AI type activities, but been\nfollowing kind of Gary McGraw with machine learning. Been part of OS\nfor quite a while. That\u0026rsquo;s an interesting topic, taking Open and pulling it\ninto Chat GPT to kind of help provide more information to people and\nhow you validate that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 01:45\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott Katie - 01:47\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m real interested in the topic. Happy to contribute. Have to drop it\nhalf past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:54\nThat\u0026rsquo;S. All right. I think what we could do is let\u0026rsquo;s stay away from the\nwhole privacy feeding data to the models thing, because let\u0026rsquo;s kind of\nassume that these versions and the next versions, for example, are the\nmodels will have solved that people will be able to create models on top of\nprivate data. People will create models on top of things that let\u0026rsquo;s not look\nat even again, some of the poisoning of the models, because I do feel that\nthere\u0026rsquo;s an area here which is the people who control the models can\nactually do a lot of stuff, including to identify malicious access, et cetera.\nAnd we know part of that. Right. Why don\u0026rsquo;t we start with, in a way, what\nis the big difference with, I would say, the GPT, the Chat GPT like\ntechnologies and the AIS that came before. Right. I\u0026rsquo;ll add that for me, it\nwas context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 02:52\nIt was the ability to have a dialogue, was the ability to express what I want\ninstead of reverse engineering what I want into a Google search and then\ngo and hunt for articles that kind of have what I want and then find\nalmost like 80% of what I want and then start to start again. Right. So,\nfor me, it was that Iron Man Jarvis kind of dialogue that I never really had\nbefore with anything that was AI specific. What about you guys say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott Katie - 03:26\nYeah, it was getting back, asking a question, getting a single answer\ncomposed from multiple search results instead of a list of search results\nthat then you had to dig into, because then you dug into them and you\nwent on long trails, so you didn\u0026rsquo;t get the, I would say, context and\nconciseness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 03:44\nWell, and I would go so far as to posit. This is one of the first times I\u0026rsquo;m\ngoing to go back and give you a memory that I have of five years ago,\nspeaking to a security vendor that was telling me about his wonderful AI\nproduct. We talked about it and the more discussion we got into it, I was\nlike, well, you\u0026rsquo;re just doing this huge if then else a thing that\u0026rsquo;s not really\nlike machine learning or AI. That\u0026rsquo;s just a really big if then statement,\nwhich cool, but not really what we\u0026rsquo;re talking about here. I think this is the\nfirst time we\u0026rsquo;ve actually been able to say it\u0026rsquo;s contextual, it understands,\nit\u0026rsquo;s able to search on general words and sentiment that you give it and\nthen give you back. Reasonable results, though how reasonable becomes a\nquestion of how well it\u0026rsquo;s been trained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 04:32\nYeah, and from my side, I think I was mostly impressed, of course, with the\nfact that it understands code, it writes code, and of course, one of the\ntopics we\u0026rsquo;re going to discuss today, it actually remediates the\nvulnerabilities in the code. This was my big revelation, kind of exactly with\na pinch of salt. The fact is that, again, because we created a lot of content\nover the past 20 years and a lot of people complain it\u0026rsquo;s quite difficult to\nnavigate this content. If you just go to a search engine like Google and you\nask about vulnerability, you\u0026rsquo;re going to get thousands, if not hundreds of\nthousands of responses. Depending on what you click and you read those\npages, you will still not understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on. I think that\u0026rsquo;s the\nability to get this summary. There\u0026rsquo;s even a way to ask Chat GPT to explain\na vulnerability like you are a five year old or if you are an eight year old,\nwhich I think is quite unique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 05:32\nThis is something what we didn\u0026rsquo;t have even though AI was in security for a\nlong time. But, yeah, I think every single SaaS vendor which claimed that\nthey have AI, I\u0026rsquo;ve never actually seen it successfully applied until now, that\nwe\u0026rsquo;re seeing in Chat GPD, which I think is probably going to affect a lot\nof SaaS vendors well, because of the topics we\u0026rsquo;re going to discuss next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 05:55\nWell, I think every single SaaS vendor should be on the work processing\nbecause their whole business could disappear, right. As soon as somebody\nintegrates equivalent Chat TPT like models. Because if I can go to the\npoint, in fact, I haven\u0026rsquo;t fully tested yet. The latest version of Copilots, I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t know if you guys used it, but the latest version of Copilot actually\nclaims to actually look at the whole code. Have you guys seen that one?\nGitHub copilot, right. The first version was which is already pretty\nspectacular, I have to say, right. It already was really good at creating\nreally good recommendations. The new version apparently I haven\u0026rsquo;t tested\nbecause I don\u0026rsquo;t think they have fully released it actually claims to look at\nthe whole code, including writing unit tests. With the whole coding context\nnow from there to actually finding all class of security vulnerabilities and\nconnect all sorts of stuff, that far, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 06:55\nIt\u0026rsquo;s almost a darker heavy lifting to be able to do that, man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 06:59\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an interesting question. Can you ask your chat GPT to create you a\nframework by which you can complete your code quicker? I mean, dude, I\ncan think of all of the things that I\u0026rsquo;ve had to code in my lifetime and the\namount of code that I\u0026rsquo;ve written that was just, gee, does this work? To get\npast that section and go right to the, well, this is perfect. We have a hard\nenough time getting people to evaluate should I actually do this, that or\nthe other, or evaluate variables as they go into code. It\u0026rsquo;s a little scary\nbecause there\u0026rsquo;s some level of discipline that you have to make sure that is\nactually enacted here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 07:34\nThink of the questions you can ask, right? If I go back to my old two\nplatform days, right, I still feel that I was doing stuff that today people still\ndon\u0026rsquo;t do, right? The way I got crazy success was by imagine this on a\nSaaS engine, right? I got to the point where I would delete all the rules\nfrom the database. I had access to one of the engines, right? I would\ncreate a call graph of everything. I would taint every entry point and\nexternal point. I would get millions of traces, literally millions of traces.\nThe beauty of that is that I will spend some time mapping the inputs and\nthe outputs, and then I have this almost real time view where the data\narrived and the ability I then have to really very quickly say, I care about\nthat. I care about that. I don\u0026rsquo;t trust this and even to say, okay, so this XML\nfile contains the glue between these web service and now web service\nthere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 08:25\nSo you go like that. You go to the database and you come like that. So\ncreate those trees. That context, which is really what advanced static\nanalysis can actually give you. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of how you really can do this.\nMy problem was I couldn\u0026rsquo;t describe the model right now, I still am getting\nto the point where I could start to describe the behavior that I want for the\nWeb services, the behavior that you want for all these things. And that\u0026rsquo;s a\ngame changer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 08:51\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s interesting to be able to say like this, well, if you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott Katie - 08:56\nCan create the pattern, then you can take a large code base and boil it\ndown to what fits the pattern and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t, and then focus on what\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t, right? So you can apply that to MIT. You can apply it to testing\nsecurity, testing even stuff like code, like checking in comments and having\na consistent framework for that where people might not even put that in.\nIf you could generate comments from code that\u0026rsquo;s written, hey, that\u0026rsquo;s a\nreally big game changer, because every developer, that saves, like, a half\nhour of time, right? If you have a security researcher looking through that,\ninstead of maybe I have to switch from one code to another and learn, I\ncan just reach through the comments and find the pattern that doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit,\nthat\u0026rsquo;s a really good use of it. It\u0026rsquo;ll save time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 09:45\nWhat I really like is that it really now aligns security with engineering. I\nthink there was a trend with engineering where we kind of threw with the\nbaby with the bathwater by saying, you don\u0026rsquo;t need architecture diagrams.\nWhat you need is quick iteration. Documentation is not that important.\nYeah, everybody wants it, but nobody seems to have the time to do it,\nright? To be able to start to describe the code, like, for example, a threat\nmodeling session, 90% of the threat modeling is just getting a freaking\ndecent architectural diagram. Once you have it, you find the threads left,\nright, and center, right? Imagine being able to be programmatically\ncreated. Imagine taking a code based and saying, hey, give me an\narchitecture diagram of this. Describe me this code in, UML, give me a dot\nversion of this code at this level of abstraction, right? That would be\nmassive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 10:31\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s the issue, though, right? You have to trust the process by which\nit was created. That\u0026rsquo;s really what I\u0026rsquo;m getting at, is how do we evaluate\nthat trust?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 10:41\nBecause real world comes into play. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a problem with changing\nbetween mistakes because I catch them, right? Like, the dude f******\nmakes up s***, right? That\u0026rsquo;s fine. In a way, I just love the fact when he\nmakes a mistake in the first answer and you correct and you go, oh, yeah,\nyou\u0026rsquo;re right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 10:57\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s the key point right there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 11:01\nThis is an existing vacuum. So, for example, even those recommendations,\neven that stuff, you have feedback loops, right? In fact, you can even have\nanother engine mapping up the feedback loop, so you can even use the\noutput of one as a prompt to the next one, right? We\u0026rsquo;re now operating at a\nmuch more efficient level. Before you had to find the people who\nunderstand the code to describe what the h*** that meant, right. Even,\nlike, the legacy stuff, right? Most developers didn\u0026rsquo;t write the original code,\nso they don\u0026rsquo;t f****** understand it. Right. To be able to say, this is how we\nbelieve it works, then reality come into play. You can even say, Here are\nthe logs, right? Can you match these logs with the architecture? Or Find\nme all the places where these logs that I know for real are being invoked?\nMatch this architecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 11:48\nThat was a question that before would be impossible on us to ask, right?\nYeah. Now we\u0026rsquo;re not far off to Nathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott Katie - 11:56\nYour point about creating a framework and then you go code, maybe take\nthe code and put it in a framework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 12:02\nYou can evaluate, which is cool, which is just d*** awesome. Right. I feel\nlike we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking over you, man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 12:17\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just a couple of things to add. Basically, the ability to add comments to\nthe code, I think what Dennis has mentioned, I think that\u0026rsquo;s revolutionary\nby itself. Obviously, if we just walk away from us being security people,\nright. It\u0026rsquo;s the amount of productivity that it\u0026rsquo;s going to add when you are\ntrying to do reverse engineering and triaging of vulnerability in a legacy\ncode is absolutely huge. Right. Because obviously we have two types of\nproblems, right. In application security, we have problem number one, how\nto make sure that the software which is being built right now is secure,\nand how do we remediate vulnerabilities in the legacy software which was\nbuilt years ago by someone else? So there\u0026rsquo;s two sides to the problem. The\ncomment writing feature, I think it\u0026rsquo;s very good in the same way that it can\nactually generate documentation. Again, you can ask it to generate\ndocumentation as if it was read by a five year old, for example, or to a\ndifferent audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 13:13\nAnd the same thing with the vulnerabilities. What I found very interesting\nis that you can ask it because obviously, when it finds vulnerabilities, you\ncan say, explain this vulnerabilities, like, I\u0026rsquo;m a CEO, I\u0026rsquo;m a non technical\nperson, and it will still do it. I think evaluate, because we are all techies,\nright? We have a problem of speaking to the management, speaking to the\nboard, and actually explaining what is the actual risk, trying to say, oh,\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a deserialization issue, or the words like cross site scripting or\nserver side request forgery, that just sounds like Chinese to any CEO and\nsome CTOs as well. I think the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s a language model and it can\nactually utilize the language to make things simpler, I think is quite\nimportant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 13:57\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve touched on something that I want to get into here, if you don\u0026rsquo;t\nmind. You touched on reverse engineering, so there\u0026rsquo;s always the forensics\nor the reverse engineering of malware that I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ve seen\nanybody use chat GPT for. You have obfuscated code that someone\nobfuscated because they don\u0026rsquo;t want you to figure out how my malware is\nworking. I think it would be really interesting to begin to look at, can we\nactually reverse engineer active malware with a Chat GPT like system that\nactually lets us figure out real quick what was the trigger and how do we\nfix it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 14:33\nI totally think that\u0026rsquo;s possible, right? I think that\u0026rsquo;s just a case of having the\nright fees, right? I want to play with you saying, can you explain these\nJavaScript codes, 4K codes, and if you ever seen it, that was two K codes\nwhere you feel what the h*** it is, right? And you can explain it. Right. I\nthink that\u0026rsquo;s really cool. Sam, on your world, I think would be really cool,\nfor example, to write Waft rules based on codes, right? But also find gaps,\nright? Take for example a firewall and say where are the blind spots on\nthis? What actually is actually happening here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 15:07\nNot just the WAFF rules. The most amazing thing is, again, going back to\nSAS, right? Mostly SAS people, it writes the SAS rules and it drives them\nbecause there\u0026rsquo;s now there\u0026rsquo;s a SEM grab and Code QL. And there\u0026rsquo;s an\nexample. Obviously my waste on the chapter called Leader Sharifman. He\nactually spent, I think, a week in Chat GPT and he actually managed to\nwrite something very useful for his team. He shared actually I know,\nobviously were in a chat bone, but Dennis, would you be able to allow me\nto share my screen? I think I should be able to, yeah, you can, yeah,\nbecause I can share the GitHub repo where that\u0026rsquo;s created called Infosec\nopen AI examples. Here you can see an example of CWE explanation\nwhich is written by Chat GPT and it is written for developer and it\nexplains what the code is vulnerable and it also remediates the code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 16:08\nAfter it remediates the code, you can ask Open AI to write the Semgrap\nrule which will detect it and prevent it in the future. And then a code QL\nrule. I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried it, but we should be able to also write a mod security\nCRS rule for the WAF as well. Also to stop it on WAF if it is a vulnerability\nwhich can be stopped on the WAF. Here it is doing sanitization and input\nvalidation. So there you go. You can see these are all the examples. This is\nall available in this repo. There\u0026rsquo;s also Python code test python code that\nyou can play with. I think this is absolutely fantastic and let me just switch\nback to the actual code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 17:00\nI would love to play with that after this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 17:03\nExactly. Obviously the languages, it was implemented in several\nlanguages, so I can show you the languages where it is proven to be\nworking. That\u0026rsquo;s java, python, c, sharp, swift, kotlin, PHP, rust, go and\nJavaScript. Basically Chat GPT will analyze the code we\u0026rsquo;ll describe the\nvulnerability in the code, we\u0026rsquo;ll show an example of vulnerable code in the\nlanguage, we\u0026rsquo;ll show an example of remediation, and it will create\nSamgrep rule to detect vulnerability and create a code QL rule to detect\nthis vulnerability. These are all the CWE for which this has been basically\ndemoed in this project. Yeah, I will copy paste the link in the chat. I\u0026rsquo;m\ngoing to stop sharing now. So there you go. That\u0026rsquo;s the working example.\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s proven to be working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 17:54\nThe built in check is then we can review that and we can make sure that\nit\u0026rsquo;s right, but also we can adjust it, right? We can say, okay, this is actually\nall well explained, or this thing here, and then it might not be perfect the\nfirst time around. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be perfect, but think about it after\n510, 20, 5000, those examples, the next one is going to be much better,\nright? Absolutely. Even more interestingly, then you can even say, okay,\nnow write the Http request to trigger that exploit, right? You can even\nthink about, okay, now deploy that rule in front of one and then verify that\nrule actually works. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 18:28\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s the thing, though, and the reason I bring it up is because this\nis the FUD that people are going to try to throw at this. When you look at\nit, what we\u0026rsquo;re looking at is way better than anything we have today. I\nthink it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to argue that, oh, an error here or there is going to\nreally make this okay. Yeah, I get it. Mistakes are going to happen. We\nhave the way to correct, move forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 18:53\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why we\u0026rsquo;re humans, right? It still requires humans to review and\nconfirm. Dennis, as you said, it still sometimes doesn\u0026rsquo;t get it right on the\nfirst time, but you can ask it to correct itself and it will do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 19:06\nAt the moment, get it right the first time at a college.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 19:11\nExactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 19:13\nThis is what someone saying, that Chat GPD is really like an intern, right?\nBasically it\u0026rsquo;s an intern who you can ask and go and do some research and\ndo some googling and bring the information back together as a project.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s essentially what it does. The thing that we\u0026rsquo;re missing, this is a\nvery early stage, right? Because Chanjibiti really entered our lives in the\npast four or five months, right, and it\u0026rsquo;s very early and I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward\nto evolution. It\u0026rsquo;s going to get significantly better very soon. Organizations\nwho are already utilizing the power of it, I think they\u0026rsquo;re understanding\nhow much further they can take it. Obviously it\u0026rsquo;s particularly the learning\nbit, because if we can basically feedback the human learning. It was\nactually for our AppSec purpose, right. We ask you to find vulnerabilities\nin the code. And let\u0026rsquo;s say I had this issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 20:05\nFor example, there are five vulnerabilities in the code. Chat GPT found\nfour out of five and explained this four out of five. I asked myself, hang on\na minute, but there is another deserialization on line 55 of this file and it\nsaid, oh yes, I apologize, I missed that. There is a deserialization and here\nis how you should be remediating this. And it gave me the example. The\nthing is it didn\u0026rsquo;t actually use the fact that I corrected it to learn and\nenhance its own knowledge base. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t make the same mistake next\ntime, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s coming right. That\u0026rsquo;s the next phase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott Katie - 20:40\nSecurity is trust the verify, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 20:43\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott Katie - 20:44\nLearning is you learn when you make mistakes. Because if you do it right\nthe first time and you don\u0026rsquo;t know, you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 20:51\nDon\u0026rsquo;T know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott Katie - 20:57\nThat\u0026rsquo;S at least the way I\u0026rsquo;m approaching Chat AI is if I can trust and then\nverify something, then I could probably automate it. I know I have some\nknown good, but you have to iterate that I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 21:14\nWe\u0026rsquo;Re moving to a place here, too, where the number of known\nvulnerabilities, the number of known issues in code is reaching a we don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave enough humans on the planet to deal with this point. As we look at\nsomething like this, we\u0026rsquo;re going to have to figure out how to automate our\nway out of the mess that we\u0026rsquo;re creating because there aren\u0026rsquo;t enough\nfingers left in the planet to hunt and peck for each of these vulnerabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScott Katie - 21:38\nHow do we correct this or time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 21:42\nTo be honest, that is something that I feel keep element here. I think for a\nlong time my main worry was I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see how we could scale, right. The\nonly thing that didn\u0026rsquo;t happen, I thought it would happen, I thought the\nattackers would get a lot more efficient and effective than they were. I still\nfeel that we still have the pace where for the amount of vulnerabilities that\nexist and for the complexity of the exploits of the ones that do exist, you\nstill assume that apart in some places, most attacks are not leveraging\nhighly advanced things, right? Of course there\u0026rsquo;s a couple of places where\nthey are, but I feel that this is the first time that I see a scale solution.\nBecause in the past, most of our solutions I would go, this will never scale\nat large. If we really need to run this up, if we really need to start\nprotecting all the NPM registries and all the dependencies that we\u0026rsquo;ve got\nand the dependencies this finally, I think gives us a good way to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:45\nThe scalability of security practices. I think the difference now, and it\u0026rsquo;s\ninteresting because we are all of a generation, right? The difference now is\nthat are we going to be able to adapt, right? Or is the new generation\ngoing to completely stream all this where for them. GBT is what Google\nwas for us. Also the difference is the time scales are much shorter. Right.\nGoogle took ten years, 15 years, right. To really gain this thing, where this\nis going to happen in a couple of years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 23:18\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s more like a couple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 23:19\nThe question will be, how do you protect against the AI agent itself? That\u0026rsquo;s\nthe next evolution, right, of this. I think in going back to the topic of this,\nif we can now start to leverage these technologies, we can actually make a\nhuge amount of the security industry a lot more relevant because as you\nguys just mentioned, that these might make mistakes. Come on, our\nindustry is a crazy offender of producing bad things, bad data, bad\ninformation, not connecting, not talking to each other all that, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 23:52\nWell, just thinking about I mean, like, we had talked about mist before we\ngot started. It\u0026rsquo;s not something that\u0026rsquo;s horribly used in the States, at least to\nmy knowledge right now. At the same time, you look at some of the things\nthat you could do with, hey, I\u0026rsquo;m going to go ahead and shove a whole\nbunch of information into this model and come up with potential issues.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 24:18\nYeah, we in a nice place where I think we have a lot of the foundations in\nplace. Right. If you look in terms of Nest, in terms of all our information,\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of good thinking that has been done in the last 20 years of\nsecurity that I think is right for really taking to the next level. ASVs is a\ngood example. It\u0026rsquo;s great, but until you can create the 20 page of ASVs that\nmatters to that application, it is never going to take off effectively. And I\nthink that\u0026rsquo;s amazing. Imagine feeding ASCs, feeding the source code and\nsaying, okay, which ones are relevant? In fact, imagine feeding it the\npolicies, feeding, you see compliance, feeding you the requirements,\nfeeding you the risk, feeding you the thread factors, right? And then say,\nokay, now take this. Now give me what I should care about, where should\nfocus, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 25:10\nEspecially on a privately trained model. I mean, yes, I can spin you all\nsorts of scary stuff about a publicly trained model and an evil insider\ndoing horrible things to you, but are you telling me that evil insider isn\u0026rsquo;t\ngoing to find an easier way to deal with your stuff? Come on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 25:27\nExactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 25:32\nYeah. I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed Timo Pagle joined, and Timo, for those who don\u0026rsquo;t know,\nis a project leader of a fantastic Ovas project called Devsep Cops Maturity\nModel. I think it would be great to bring him in and hear his opinion on\nhow chat GPD can help in development of maturity models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 25:55\nYeah, if you can join in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 26:06\nYou directly ask me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 26:09\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 26:09\nI\u0026rsquo;m not having answer. I have to think about answer, right? It\u0026rsquo;s not\nsomething where we can directly have a good answer. What do you think\nmight be very able to ask GBT? A problem which I\u0026rsquo;m having is to identify\nat which level should an activity be? Right? I estimate kind of expert\njudgment, how much effort is it, how is the value? There are things which\nwould be nice to ask Chat GBT about the opinion, but currently I would\nthink it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a good opinion. I didn\u0026rsquo;t ask, but I assume it doesn\u0026rsquo;t\nhave a good opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 26:52\nYou should try. You\u0026rsquo;d be surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 26:57\nAs we get into this, I think looking at Chat GPT and what it\u0026rsquo;s going to be\ngood for is the first step. Right? If we look at a process, let\u0026rsquo;s pretend that\nwe all own a company and we\u0026rsquo;re going to go ahead and use Chat GP to do\na thing. I like Timo\u0026rsquo;s concept of what is the actual output and what money\ncan we make, what is the driving force for doing a what do we get out the\nback of it? I think as we look at code review, as we look at some of the\nthings that we could probably have it do, there\u0026rsquo;s a pretty substantial\nbenefit coming out the back of that could probably be monetized from the\nCFO and say, hey, without this many errors, we will have this much more\nmoney because we\u0026rsquo;ve saved this much time. I think as we get into it, that\u0026rsquo;s\nprobably the way to go, though, if that\u0026rsquo;s your point, Timo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 27:44\nIsh yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 27:48\nThat\u0026rsquo;S how you could express it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 27:52\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at your example. You have the Devse maturity model, right? I\nthink models like those, I think the real value is they set up the best\npractices. The problem is always how do you connect that with reality and\nactionable items. What\u0026rsquo;s interesting is to say, here\u0026rsquo;s the latest version and\nyou think about it. Some of these things you need that ingestion, right?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the latest version that has been modified. This is this week\u0026rsquo;s\nversion, whatever. This is the latest version of a particular maturity model.\nHere is now the code, or the organization structure, or the systems, or the\nthings, or the practice or the CI pipeline that the organization has. What\nare the next things that should happen? Right. What is the maturity model\nof the organization based on the standard? Those are the kind of\nquestions that you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to ask something like Chat TPT once you can\nfeed some of these data in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 28:47\nIn fact, I think it\u0026rsquo;s interesting because the latest version already allows\nyou, I think it\u0026rsquo;s 10,000 words or something like that, to feed data in. We\nalso need to start thinking about how can you package things in a way\nthat you can actually feed the model right. Ask the question on top of the\nmodel. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 29:07\nIt would be very nice to. Give all the project source code to it and then it\ntells you where you are, right, that would be amazing. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to\nsing, it just says that is done, that\u0026rsquo;s not done, that\u0026rsquo;s the next step. Yeah,\nthat would be very cool. I think a lot of questions can be answered when\nyou just give your code, right? Because you do infrastructure as code\nnowadays. Actually every point, not every point, but most of the points in\nsuch a maturity model you could probably get a good answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 29:45\nOne of the things I like about where Microsoft is going with this bing, if\nyou go up some keep showing that\u0026rsquo;s great. One of the things I like about\nthis evolution is that they start to show the sources and I think that\u0026rsquo;s going\nto be an evolution here. Right. I think the whole idea that it\u0026rsquo;s also black\nmagic will move before because we want to know that, right? Because you\ncan even want to have one model kind of analyzing the other model\nanswers to say how much of that is actually true, how much of that is\nactually made up. Because there is things called now the auto AI. If you\nguys seen those, which is when they actually try to automate and create\nand basically have this really nice workflow where you almost start to\nthink about here are the tasks you want, here are the models you\u0026rsquo;re going\nto use, here\u0026rsquo;s the structure, here are the tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 30:32\nAt the end and when you do that, you start to be able to feed it a lot more\ncomplex data. Timothy, to your point, right, you should say here\u0026rsquo;s my app,\nhe\u0026rsquo;s my architecture, here\u0026rsquo;s my environment, he\u0026rsquo;s my AWS environment,\nright. Here\u0026rsquo;s my logs. Here is 2GB of cloud trail logs right now apply. Now\nthe devsecos principles or the DevSecOps thing here. Those are the kind of\nquestions that before would be crazy to answer, right? Just think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 31:03\nI mean, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to write IAM ever again. No more IAM rules. Off you\ngo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 31:10\nYou now start to write intent, which is different. So you start to write\nrules. So your rules should be the intent. This is where it gets really cool\nbecause now you start to hit the business requirements. You start to say\nwhat I want is for these users to do this that thing. What I want is for this\nproject to have these properties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 31:29\nDennis, can I also add one very important clarification? You can also ask\nmake the suggestions based on the assumption that the business type is\nmedical or health, government, utility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 31:44\nAnd all the regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 31:45\nAnd this is all the regulations. That\u0026rsquo;s where I found very good value, right?\nFor example, we can take any of the requirements and just say okay, what\ndo I need to address if I am a medical organization? What do I need to\naddress if I\u0026rsquo;m a bank and please prioritize this for me if I\u0026rsquo;m an automotive\nmanufacturer or airplane manufacturer, I think that\u0026rsquo;s a very great value\nof large language model context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:14\nRight, and the whole point of the maturity model is exactly that. Right. If\nyou look at, again, maturity model as an example, you should say where\nare we and what are the next steps and where should be the priorities?\nAgain, you can still verify that, but the ability for that to scale is\nenormous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 32:33\nWell, just looking at the I think the regulation point that Sam made is just\nhorribly pertinent, especially with EU and GDPR and all of the crazy stuff\nthat we have to start looking at is what is actually PII. Okay, we\u0026rsquo;re going\nto go ahead and write this regulation body, that\u0026rsquo;s great. This corpus of\ntext can be sucked into and I get that this can\u0026rsquo;t happen yet sucked into\nChat GPT and go ahead and look at my code and tell me if any of this\ncode is actually putting to logs something that is PII. That\u0026rsquo;s been one of\nthe gremlins for privacy for years. All of a sudden we have PII going to\nlogs accidentally and oh my God, what the h***? To be able to pull that\nout and say, well, look, we\u0026rsquo;ve seen all of this stuff and this function right\nhere is going to do that bad thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 33:19\nI mean, even just a highlight over three or four of those places as opposed\nto having to read millions of lines of code to find that huge benefit, makes\nhigh trust a h*** of a lot more achievable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:31\nYeah. If there\u0026rsquo;s no describing intent, this is like the worldly maps. This is\nan evolutionary step, right? This is one of those where the way I think\nabout this is like the thing about really cool the worldly maps is that you\ngot the genesis commodity, right? Now we don\u0026rsquo;t know which one will jump\nfrom product to commodity. Right. Like you think about it before charge\nGPT, who\u0026rsquo;s going to get that first? If you make bets, you probably say\nGoogle, right? Maybe even Apple or Tesla or other organization or some\nof the AI things. What these guys did with the GDP four was they made an\nevolutionary jump. Now we can predict what will happen next because the\nnext jumps are not that great. They\u0026rsquo;re just little evolutionary little things.\nThe big jump has been done. If you look at, for example, like we talk\nabout Google, I stop using Google for now because I prefer to describe the\nintent that I have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 34:27\nUnless it\u0026rsquo;s an esoteric thing, I now spend my time describing what the\nintent I have and refining the intent that I have, which is a lot more\nefficient way of doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 34:36\nYeah, but are you actually using Chat GPT? Because obviously, again, very\ninteresting point about Google losing in this race because as I just shared\nas my screen from Microsoft Bing search engine, because Bing actually\ncombined the chat GPT with live internet search results. Even though it\ntakes a while because it thinks about answer, what it comes back with is\nactually probably exactly what you describe in terms of what you want to\nachieve. So there you go. Here just ask about again, since Timo is here\nabout OS devseco\u0026rsquo;s maturity model and it gave me the precise answer and\nit suggested me the next question, which is how can I implement this\nmodel in my organization? Again, it provided me some information, what\nneeds to be done to implement in my organization. Itself suggests the\nquestion what are the benefits of using Fseco ops maturity model? I think\nthese additional prompts and the fact that it kind of leads you down a\npath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 35:38\nProbably we\u0026rsquo;ve all seen this answer suggestions from Outlook or from\nMicrosoft teams or whatever, even from LinkedIn when it suggests you\nsome answers. They were completely nonsensical up until now, because\nnow it actually makes sense. For example, there you go, it says, well, you\nneed to carry out a self assessment of your organization security practice\nand say well, how do I do this? And it tells me more. Only Microsoft Bing\nhas it at the moment. Google thing still needs to catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:21\nJtbg UI will give you this, right? Again, this is just on the Bing\nenvironment, right? But it comes from there. It seems that\u0026rsquo;s the thing, it\u0026rsquo;s\nthe feeding of the model, right? What gets interesting is when you can give\nit data, when you say here\u0026rsquo;s my organization. To be honest, this is where\nthe next discussion, for example, again, let\u0026rsquo;s go back to DevSecOps model.\nI think we now need to think about how can you create, how can you feed\ndata that is relevant to the DevSecOps model, that allows good basically\nnot just the review, but the analysis. Because think about it, in the past you\ncreate a model, then you go how do evaluate this? That would be a\nmassive manual effort to do it, right? Because how do you review it?\nWhere now we can say, okay, if you are on this, let\u0026rsquo;s say if you have\nGoogle cloud, right, then you need to get this data feed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:13\nIf you have AWS, then you get that data feed. If you have GitHub, then you\nget GitLab, you get this feed, right? That can then be the feeding of the\ndata to the model, right? You can have the actions, and then you start to\nhave the feedback loop, right? As time changes, you can then say okay,\nand then you say okay, here was the last analysis, here\u0026rsquo;s where we are\nnow. How much have we progressed and what are the next steps?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 37:44\nI think as we get into it. I mean, beyond all of that even, let\u0026rsquo;s look at it\nfrom an operationalist point of view. Let\u0026rsquo;s pretend now that we\u0026rsquo;re all\noperationalists and we have to keep our company alive for the next. Take\nyour pick. How cool would it be from a DevSec Ops model to be able to\nsay code one side, camera here, code one side, and monitoring an Ops on\nthe other. Now not only can I tell you that both things actually are being\nevaluated, like I\u0026rsquo;m looking at your code and I have the monitors for\noperations to hand them and say this is actually getting monitored all the\ntime. The observability for this is right here. Being able to click on it and\ngo back to the actual function that monitor is testing. I mean, the ability\nso geeky incident responder in me goes, oh my God, I can actually look at\nall of these things and say this goes back to this set of code and this is why\nthis is happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:37\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a game changer. This is what I\u0026rsquo;m saying. I think the security vendors,\nwhich are critical part of infrastructure, they really need to step out\nbecause most of the tools now for me started too primitive. Really. I\ncannot ask this kind of question. Really, I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to SQL or this\nkind of complex queries. I want context, right? A lot of the times, a lot of\nthe engines, a lot of the business build engines on top of it. They need to\nrestructure to say they need to be using a chat DBT like environment.\nThey need to start creating their graphs in a way that is consumable by\nthat. I think that\u0026rsquo;s the biggest transformation is that now graphs will\nreally scale because that\u0026rsquo;s why these engines can consume very well. We\ncan now use graphs for context, but we don\u0026rsquo;t have to create them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:25\nWe just have to almost start thinking about the instructions for how to\ncreate a model around it. There\u0026rsquo;s already a nice marketplace for models,\nso we need to start have models again for the bits that we use, right? You\ncould even argue that every framework should eventually come up with a\nmodel that understands how that framework behaves because every\nframework has things that are unique to them. The Spring framework, the\nExpress framework, the Fast API framework, whatever, the Net Rest API\nframework, all those frameworks have behaviors that then once you have\na model that understands it, you can ask so much better questions on it.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I think that\u0026rsquo;s a big game changer. I think in the security world,\nwhat I will say is that we are well poised to leverage this. I think the good\nsecurity team should not be driving a lot of innovation because we should\nbe on a forefront with all these transformations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 40:31\nThe next thing is how can we change the business with it? Right. Because\na lot of because I got to the point for me where I feel I need to understand\nthe business in order to protect the business, right. Most of the changes\nthat we want to do are changes to the business. I see that the real\ninteresting opportunity here is help the business to understand itself, drive\nchange there so we can push the security changes with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 40:56\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s that and I think that\u0026rsquo;s the if you look at how, the\noverarching, thing that\u0026rsquo;s going to drive this into business is the fact, hey,\nwe can make more money on that. The reality of being able to look at\nthese things and be able to say from just the stupid simple things that it\ncould do. I was talking to a red teamer that got shoved into incident\nresponse and he had to make a choice and he decided that he was going to\nclear out all of the AWS API credentials for a service when he realized his\ncompany had been hacked. I expressed to him that was probably a bad\nchoice. And he said, well, but why? I said, well, because you just caused an\neight hour outage for your website. That was bad. As an incident\nresponder, we can get that, we can understand that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 41:50\nIf you could build out a model that allows you to ask questions like that as\nyou\u0026rsquo;re going and be able to say, hey, what\u0026rsquo;s the right answer here? Be able\nto have it give you a contextual response of, well, if you do that, these are\nthe things that are going to proceed from that thing. Now I don\u0026rsquo;t expect it\nto be able to say, no, don\u0026rsquo;t do that\u0026rsquo;s a bit much, but just give you a\ncontextual response about, hey, this is what\u0026rsquo;s happening right now, it\nwould be really nice to know that I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t delete the AWS API\ncredentials. These are the things that are going to come out of that choice\ncontext.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 42:22\nRight, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 42:24\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;re talking about, Nathan, I think it\u0026rsquo;s also decision trees, right. In\nthe context of security incident Response, that\u0026rsquo;s actually one of the\nadvantage, that it can actually give you a decision trees. As we just seen in\nmy live demo, it can take you down a specific path so it can go deeper and\nif necessary, go down to the line of code or particular change. I know\nsome companies already started doing things like feeding change requests\nthat they made to the configuration of the systems into it. That makes\ninterest of what change affected this incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 43:00\nAbsolutely. This makes a decision tree scale. The challenge I always have\nin decision Tree path is that to be really useful, it has to be very specific. In\norder to be very specific, it becomes massive. Right. And then people get\noverwhelmed, right? Because you need the detail. What this allows us to\ndo is to have context. You have a massive object model, a mass decision\ntree, but you only see this bit. That bit, more importantly, not just a small\nbit, is in context. In fact, this is an example where some of the next\ngeneration of chat DBT like technologies, we don\u0026rsquo;t want deviation. I think\nat the moment with this first experimentation, we still at the mode where\nwe almost again, it\u0026rsquo;s fun that image mistakes and it\u0026rsquo;s fun that\u0026rsquo;s 100%\ncorrect. We can get to a point where we says we don\u0026rsquo;t want that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 43:51\nWe want to say this is your body of knowledge, don\u0026rsquo;t use anything else,\njust use that. That\u0026rsquo;s the current decision tree. What you need to\nunderstand is what those words mean in the action of that. From a\ndecision point of view or the secrets of events, this should be your truth.\nAgain, we\u0026rsquo;re not that far off on it. This is just a question of what data you\nfeed them on versus the model having. In fact, I think sometimes the cool\nmodels are too powerful. We actually need less powerful. Some of these\nengines that don\u0026rsquo;t have all the emotion and don\u0026rsquo;t have all the ambiguity,\ndon\u0026rsquo;t have all the ability to come up with things, just have the ability to\nunderstand and execute on certain things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 44:30\nWell, something stupid simple like let\u0026rsquo;s give it the corpus of Windows\nServer code, just that thing. We\u0026rsquo;re going to give it all of it manuals for the\nlast 20 years. I, as a new person coming out of college, need to do an ad\nset up. How do I do an ad set up? Done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:53\nMore importantly, how do I do an ad set up? With this configuration?\nCorrect. This configuration is going to be different than that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 45:03\nOr even to ask me the questions about do you want to do this, that or the\nother? These are the outcomes to your point about decision trees, in many\ncases, the decision tree is actually the thing that the new person doesn\u0026rsquo;t\nhave yet. They don\u0026rsquo;t even know that. They don\u0026rsquo;t know. How do I even\nbegin to ask that question?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:19\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s the sweet spot now, right? I think companies who can\naddress that in security, we are such a complex world now that we are ripe\nfor that innovation. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s what gets interesting. And it\u0026rsquo;s like\nSam was showing it. You now can start some really lovely feedback loops\nbetween the tools where you feed here and you feed that and then you\nalmost let reality validate it, if you think about it. If I\u0026rsquo;m saying that I have\na last rule, I have a rule here, I have a thingy here that\u0026rsquo;s supposed to lock\nthis down. The next time you get the data, it should confirm that, right?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not a zero sum game. I think that\u0026rsquo;s where it gets interesting is when\nyou feed models to models, when you chain them, which eventually it can\ngo south very fast. I think we also have a massive potential to accelerate a\nlot of these things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:10\nYeah, cool. Right, guys? Oh, Sam\u0026rsquo;s gonna give us another good example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 46:16\nSam\u0026rsquo;s gonna do one more thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:20\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 46:24\nSam\u0026rsquo;S on mute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:26\nSam, you\u0026rsquo;re mute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 46:34\nWhat Sam\u0026rsquo;s showing us here is the summary of reporting on incidents,\nwhich is interesting because it actually gives us the source code that it\ncame up with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 46:41\nThe question here was, how can I use Chat GPD for security incident\nresponse? But very interestingly. Right. It contains an ad. Can you see\nthis? It actually advertises Microsoft Sentinel and Defender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:58\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s interesting. It was the answer above. Influenced by Microsoft.\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s a really cool tool that should be built, which is to\nunderstand the bias of the engines. I actually think that tool is important\nbecause we talk about these engines being sentiment one day, right?\nHopefully not that far. I think we need to start detecting that. I think we\nneed to start having almost like we need to start almost like pen testing a\nGBT engine to see, for example, like that. Does he have bias? Does he\nhave bias on gender? Also, does he have buyers on data points? Does he\nhave bias against companies? Does he have buyers against well, it\u0026rsquo;s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 47:43\nOwned by Microsoft and I just showed you an example how it was biased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 47:47\nObviously it\u0026rsquo;s a little biased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:49\nExactly. Right. But that\u0026rsquo;s an important point. Right? It\u0026rsquo;s an important\npoint to understand the bias of this. Right. I think it\u0026rsquo;s one of those cases\nthat as the technology matures, it\u0026rsquo;s again, we need to understand the\nframework that we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with because this is going to become all new\nvery fast. We\u0026rsquo;re going to expect to talk to our engines, we\u0026rsquo;re going to\nexpect to talk to this going back to the Microsoft copilot. If you look at\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a whole ratchet of copilot products and they\u0026rsquo;re launching out for\nWord, for PowerPoint, for all these things, right? So they\u0026rsquo;re really raising\nthe level. We need to start framing, but also identifying the buys and\nlimitations of the engine. Pen testing is a good cooler, the engines\nthemselves, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 48:34\nDifferent sort of pen test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:35\nYeah, different sort of Pen test. Right. But understand those blind spots.\nRight. I feel that because you can feed one to the other, we will basically\nratch up quite effectively a lot of the stuff that we\u0026rsquo;re doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 48:48\nWe teach them to feed one to the other and then we teach it to feed one to\nthe other, what happens? We make skynet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:56\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the thing. It\u0026rsquo;s when you have actions. But that\u0026rsquo;s an interesting\nconcern. Right? I think it\u0026rsquo;s a valid concern that these pads leads to that.\nBilly, may I ask a question?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 6 - 49:15\nYeah. Can you guys hear me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:17\nGood. Perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 6 - 49:21\nI was just going to chime in about the bias thing. I actually seen people\ntest that to see if it has a certain bias based on different views or things\nlike that. What they were able to determine was that it will have a bias\nbased on how you frame a conversation. If you ask it I don\u0026rsquo;t want to start\na warrant here or anything, but if you ask it something like point out the\nways that this political leader is a tyrant and it will post exactly that. It\u0026rsquo;ll\npost all of the things against that particular leader. But if you post a\nquestion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:18\nWhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 6 - 50:18\nIt\u0026rsquo;S more political or more of an equal footing, then it will try to answer it\nbased on that. I think what it really boils down to is people are going to\nget the answers that they really want until they can make it more of a\nmegaworth checks for that kind of context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:49\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why if you think that almost, I guess, to our world, it\u0026rsquo;s interesting\nto think that we could have a world where we have a security bot that is\nused by developers, by engineers, by practitioners that we have already fed\nour BIOS. In that way the bias could be a good thing because we want\nspecific things to occur. We want specific frameworks to be used. We want\nsecurity practices to be used. Right? If you imagine, like, if you have a\ndeveloper running a web service and using a bot to help it, we want the\nbot to already think about the best way to deploy the web service, the best\nway to protect it, the best way to authenticate it, to validate all that jazz.\nRight? It\u0026rsquo;s an interesting way once you understand how we can influence\nan engine. I agree that the way you ask the questions, you can determine\nthe output, but it\u0026rsquo;s also a way to understand your audience, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 51:46\nI\u0026rsquo;m assuming now this is in an environment where you can see the\nfeedback loops. So cool, guys. We only are look, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot of good\nstuff, Sam. Thanks for sharing those. Those are really cool, right? I think\nwe need to do that one of these every two months because things are\ngoing to change so fast, right. We need to start showing some good\nexamples of this going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 52:10\nGoing back to your favorite topic for people who haven\u0026rsquo;t seen Dennis\u0026rsquo;s\ntalk at OAS London about using Jira for managing your security program.\nSo, of course, one of the things that you can use, and I\u0026rsquo;ve seen people\nstarted using Chatgpt Impact on advice, for example, publication security,\njust create Jira tickets. With a text in this, Jira tickets will be context\nspecific and very relevant and in a language which can be understood by\nsoftware developers find who\u0026rsquo;s doing that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 52:39\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t seen good examples of that. Let me know who\u0026rsquo;s doing it. Let\u0026rsquo;s\ninvite them to do a session. Right? I would love to see that. Cool. Any final\nwords on this topic?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 52:52\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s very important for us to understand that this is all very new and\nwe\u0026rsquo;re already seeing some very exciting developments. I had conversation\nwith a few vendors and saying, well, are you threatened by this? They said,\nno, we actually embrace it. That\u0026rsquo;s where I see probably in the next year,\nwe will see security vendors, SaaS vendors, and just cybersecurity vendors\nactually embracing this technology. Finally, the AI on the data sheet is\ngoing to mean something. Not just we use AI and machine learning, so\nplease buy us. And we also use blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 53:25\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 53:25\nThe usual buzzword. So I think this evolution is coming. Again, we have a\nresponsibility from security engineering perspective. Just make sure that\nit\u0026rsquo;s also secure. The use of it is secure. I know we haven\u0026rsquo;t touched on\ntopics like privacy and giving it personal data, company data, and\ncompany intellectual property, such as source code. That\u0026rsquo;s probably a\ntopic for next conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 53:51\nHacking GPT is a different thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 53:56\nAny final thoughts, Nathan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 53:59\nI think we need to approach chat GPT and frankly, any of the other chat\nbots. Very much the same way we approached Cloud and very much the\nway we approached, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, databases back in the 80s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:12\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 54:12\nI mean, this is a change to the way that things work, and that\u0026rsquo;s okay. It\u0026rsquo;s\nnot the end of the world. There are going to be things that we need to\nwork through and there are going to be errors and we\u0026rsquo;re going to screw\nup and we\u0026rsquo;re going to fix it and it\u0026rsquo;ll be okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 54:34\nYeah, I think it will be amazing. In the future, maybe only the person who\ncan ask the right question will get paid in a good way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:46\nYeah. Well, it\u0026rsquo;s more reality now than it was four months ago. Right. I\nthink it\u0026rsquo;s like the Internet, right? It changed a lot, but then we evolve and\nwe go to the next level. Right. I think the difference is going to between\nthe people who use it and people who don\u0026rsquo;t use it. I think that\u0026rsquo;s why we\nneed to learn how to use this very effectively. Cool. All right, guys, thanks\na lot for this one. We starting to move the needle and I\u0026rsquo;ll see you guys in\nthe next one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 55:13\nThank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 55:14\nThanks, guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2023/mini-summits/Apr/ChatGpt/","event":"mini-summit","expirydate":-62135596800,"facebook":null,"fuzzywordcount":1e4,"hey_summit":"https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0vcOCurjkvGdC6Zcca0TAt1WFKg4-ZKYXZ","image":null,"job_title":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752075784,"layout":"","linkedin":null,"notes":null,"objectID":"9fd074df002b55d782ac1b746295aec1","organizers":["Dinis Cruz","Nathan Case"],"permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/chatgpt/chatgpt_impact_on_cyber_security/","project":null,"publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":47,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/chatgpt/chatgpt_impact_on_cyber_security/","section":"sessions","status":null,"summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"session-transcript\"\u003eSession Transcript:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 00:02\nHi. Welcome to the Open Security Summit session in April 2023. This is a\nvery topical topic because it\u0026rsquo;s about Chatgpt impact on cyber and\napplication security. We have a great set of panels. Dennis. I run the open\nsecurity summit. I\u0026rsquo;m the Cecil of Honor Barrett and the chief scientist of\nGlasswall. Sam, we can do by you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Stepanyan - 00:25\nYeah, I\u0026rsquo;m Sam Stepanyan. By day.

We have here our friends from\nPermit IO and led by their co founder Always, and then other technical\nlead, Odete Ben, David and Gabriel Elmanor, their Director of Debril. So,\nover to you everyone. We\u0026rsquo;re going to have a panel discussion for cloud\nnative security tools. Enhancing Cloud Protection capabilities. Over to you\nguys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 00:39\nThank you. So it\u0026rsquo;s really a pleasure to be here at the Open Security\nSummit. We\u0026rsquo;ve been here in the past and was always a and as were\nintroduced, I\u0026rsquo;m happy to have with me some of my great teammates, Odet\nand Gabriel. And our topic for today for this panel is cloud Native\nSecurity Tools and how you enhance your cloud protection capabilities. I\nthink this is quite a huge topic to cover, so we probably won\u0026rsquo;t cover all of\nit in one go, but I think we can start touching on some key points here and\nI think I\u0026rsquo;ll kick us off and then we\u0026rsquo;ll roll with the conversation. Also,\npeople in the audience, if you want to ask a question, please utilize the\nchat capabilities here and we\u0026rsquo;d love to kind of take those into the\nconversation as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 01:36\nSo, first and foremost, I think when we talk about cloud native security, I\nthink we need to talk about cloud native applications and understand\nwhere we\u0026rsquo;re standing there. So we\u0026rsquo;ve come a long way from monolith\napplications running on your laptop or running on a server within a server\nfarm. Now, software is distributed. It\u0026rsquo;s built of tiny components that are\nall interconnected in some way, and all of them are performing critical\nactions against a constantly growing distributed data plane. So we have\nmore information as part of our applications, more information as part of\nour organizations, and more information as part of interconnections\nbetween companies, customers, partners as well. And another thing that is\nbecoming more commonplace but is still rather new, is these software\ncomponents becoming intelligent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 02:32\nSo AI agents, specifically large language models, are more often being\nembedded into software and that\u0026rsquo;s also changing dramatically how we\nview those microservices. So in the past if we had a small microservice\nthat was running on Lambda, we knew that it\u0026rsquo;s a very simple component.\nNow you can\u0026rsquo;t even know that anymore. It can have a lot of sophistication\nand it can affect a lot of the area around that. So I think that\u0026rsquo;s kind of\nwhere we\u0026rsquo;re at and where this discussion is kind of going to focus and I\nwant to take it with you folks. You, Gabriel. And you did. Where do you\nthink the main problems are today when we\u0026rsquo;re trying to protect our cloud\nnative applications? Maybe, Gabriel, maybe you can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 03:21\nSo you gave a nice brief introduction, usually when speaking about cloud\nnative security. So there are the four C\u0026rsquo;s code, which is the application\ncode container, which is the tiny piece of the application that\u0026rsquo;s running\ncluster, which is where we built the architecture and cloud which is the\nruntime that running our applications or architectures. I think that cloud\nis not in you filled in security because the cloud is here for time. Also\ncontainerized applications or applications are running independently is\nnot that new. I think where we see the most new trends in cloud native\nsecurity is code, where most of the software development organizations\ntoday are looking in a trend called shift left or DevSecOps where we are\nsecuring the application from the first line of code that we are writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 04:26\nSo we want to make sure that we are proactively secure our application\nfrom the small piece of it like a code and cluster, which is mean for\nspecific architectures that taking containerized applications and running\nthem together in a cloud agnostic environment. So for example, the most\ncommon example is Kubernetes, that you can take Kubernetes and run it\non every cloud provider. So you potentially agnostic to the cloud provider\nyou want and we need to find the new pillar to secure these kind of\narchitectures. So again, in my opinion the most fascinating thing to think\nabout new tools and new trends is code and clusters. But of course also\nhow we secure the cloud itself. The cloud does the runtime and\ncontainerized or like artifacts of applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 05:29\nYeah, I think you can basically look at it as different perimeters of defense\nthat you have. This also I think works well as analogy to the real world.\nSo you have like a wall around your forts and you have your guard towers\nand then you move closer and closer into the core of your compound. And\nthe more you move in, the more sensitive things are and the less protection\nyou have in place. I see Denise joining us. Hey Denise, were already\nkicking this off without you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 06:02\nNo, absolutely. Sorry I was a bit late. So I was just finishing the\nconference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 06:08\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ll keep rolling with that thought and then feel free to kind of join in\nand navigate the conversation. So as I was saying, you have different\nlevels of defense and the deeper you go, the more you move from the cloud\nenvironment, you move into the code. Obviously the attacker landing there\nhas more ability to affect things and more ability to be more sophisticated.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s also to something you could be counterintuitive because you\u0026rsquo;re\nthinking oh, if I have someone locked in a container then I can limit what\nthey do. But because applications are becoming more and more\ninterconnected and they\u0026rsquo;re becoming more sophisticated, they can actually\ndo more damage in the application level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 06:56\nSo yeah, maybe their code is limited to running within that container, but\ntheir effect on talking to other APIs and leveraging the secrets that are\navailable to that code and leapfrogging from there is not actually as\nlimited as you want it to be. So in the past with non cloud native\napplications, I think running something containerized or on a separate VM\nthat provided a lot of protection. And nowadays, as we move things more\nand more to the application layer, there\u0026rsquo;s more sensitivity in the code area\nitself. And that\u0026rsquo;s something that I think not a lot of people have been\nthinking about. Odette, do you have something to add here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 07:36\nYes, I actually want to join to the last point and said that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 07:47\nWhen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 07:47\nWe have a lot of applications that part of your application that talking\nwith each others, it\u0026rsquo;s usually you don\u0026rsquo;t think about securing your own\napplication from itself, you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about how to protect it, as you\nsaid, to build a wall. But now we are talking a lot more about zero trust.\nEven inside the application, there are parts that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t get authorized\nto all the parts of the application. Quick example could be your fronted\nmicroservice shouldn\u0026rsquo;t get to your database. He should get access through\nyour back end or even a dedicated microservice in your back end that only\nit allows full access to your database. So these, for example, show us that\nthe new cloud architectures take us to a new way of thinking about\nauthorization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 09:03\nYeah, look, I could agree with that, guys. In fact, you remind me of this\nlittle cartoon here, right? Can you sure. To see my screen? Can you see\nthis? Right? It\u0026rsquo;s from XST, but it\u0026rsquo;s a bit like, hey look, I got a user account\non the laptop. I can access Dropbox, Photos, Facebook, Gmail, PayPal,\nbank, but at least you can\u0026rsquo;t install drivers without permission, right? So I\nthink the key of all this is context, right? And I do agree that sometimes we\ngo and says, oh, now I\u0026rsquo;m in the container. It\u0026rsquo;s good. Actually, no, because\na bit of code or a vulnerability in a container that has high privileged\naccess to assets can be way more dangerous than full access to a back end\nsystem that has no data, no assets, no major criticality, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 09:53\nI think that the key challenge is understand the context and making good\nsecurity decisions. And a lot of the times what we end up doing across\nmultiple generations of this is we throw the baby with the bathwater, so\nwe go, oh, we don\u0026rsquo;t really understand this, let\u0026rsquo;s go to the cloud. And then\nyou kind of ditch all those great sysadmins that you had and then you\nrealize that when you get to the cloud, you do still need those\nunderstanding, right? And then you go, oh, let\u0026rsquo;s now containerize this and\nyou did this stuff, now let\u0026rsquo;s go everything over there. And then there\u0026rsquo;s a set\nof skills that are critical, like understanding role permissions,\nunderstanding assets, understanding who accessing is, what and that stuff,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 10:31\nAnd that has been almost one of those elephants in our industry, especially\non security, that we almost used to say we don\u0026rsquo;t understand it. Right?\nThere\u0026rsquo;s applications that are there that there\u0026rsquo;s nobody who actually\nunderstands how that thing actually works. Especially when you look,\nauthentication authorization, right? Especially on role based stuff. There\u0026rsquo;s\nso much complexity sometimes that some systems have that it\u0026rsquo;s crazy,\nright. And in a way, the access is not just on an app, is the app is running.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s almost like the Cascading privileges occur across the board on those\nenvironments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 11:04\nYeah, and I think that really highlights the point that in the end of the day,\nthere is no silver bullet. Like people looking for a silver bullet that say, oh,\nI\u0026rsquo;ll just take a container or I\u0026rsquo;ll just take another, apply it and I\u0026rsquo;ll be done\nand good. That\u0026rsquo;s not going to happen probably ever. But what you can do,\nand that\u0026rsquo;s the closest thing you can get to a silver bullet, is design security\ninto your product, into its core at day one, and continuously build that.\nAnd I think components that are part of the application itself, primarily\nauthentication and authorization, those can bake in a lot of that security\naspect in an inherent fashion into your software. And you can be much\nmore clear and build zero trust connections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 11:54\nSo you know, for each microservice, specifically, what is it allowed to do\nand how you manage the policy for it, how it connects to your database,\nhow it connects to other services, how it connects to external services. And\nyou can enforce that across the chain constantly from the code that\u0026rsquo;s\nyeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 12:15\nBut I want to challenge you on this one, right? Because I think there\u0026rsquo;s lots\nof bodies on that road, right, and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of really good teams and\nreally good technologies on that road. And for a while we had these secure\nby design, secure by default, and secure deployment, which actually good.\nActually, Google is recycling the Microsoft stuff on it. Right, but the\nproblem is complexity, right? The problem is there\u0026rsquo;s a moment where I\u0026rsquo;m\nthe first one to say the better design, the better your architecture, the\nmore visibility you have. But I have to say, up until recently, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see\nhow what you described eventually works in practice. And I know there\u0026rsquo;s\nexamples that you can do it and there\u0026rsquo;s sometimes you can game the\nsystem because some apps allow that to happen a bit more easily than\nothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 12:57\nBut I think the piece of the puzzle, or one of the piece of the puzzle that I\nthink we now have the ability to do is Gen AI brings us the possibility to\nstart to understand context across multiple layers. And that\u0026rsquo;s a game\nchanger, right? Because what it allows us to do is the feedback loops that\nallows good decisions to occur in the environment that you just described.\nBecause even if you design something really well, there\u0026rsquo;s moments where\ncomplexity and change hit the real world. And again, business\nrequirements change, et cetera. And without a real good understanding\nand without the ability to connect the dots between the people who are\nmaking decisions, people who understand it, to the information that is\nhappening to what\u0026rsquo;s really being deployed and what\u0026rsquo;s really going on.\nThose systems eventually start to move away from that state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 13:51\nAnd I feel for the first time, look, Bruce Wayne, three months ago, four\nmonths ago, you would say that, and I go, Cool, that\u0026rsquo;s still a great graph.\nAnd I think you guys build variations of this, right? And yeah, you can get\nthat with graphs, you can get that with connections, but without the\nability to start to applying context and start to have a dialogue and to\ntranslate that to all sorts of different audiences so that you can make good\ndecisions, right? That for me, was the piece of the puzzle because now you\ncan go, not yet, but we quite close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 14:21\nYou can start to go to understanding code, understanding cloud\nformation, understanding changes, understanding the impact, understand\nthe behavior, and have almost a chain of bots that together start to tell\nyou, by the way, you\u0026rsquo;re just connecting the dots now just to wrap up. What\nI think is that this is going to reward good architecture, this is going to\nreward good systems, because you\u0026rsquo;re going to get to the point where the\nanalysis is, I don\u0026rsquo;t freaking understand what the hell is going on here,\nright. And it\u0026rsquo;s too complex. We can\u0026rsquo;t freaking understand it to, oh, no, this\nis what\u0026rsquo;s happening. This is the changes, this is the risks you\u0026rsquo;re doing. This\nis the situation where we are now. Right? And of course, that model\nrewards good engineering. That model rewards security by default and I\nthink provides a feedback loop that was missing, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 15:07\nSo that teams can make great business cases because you can now see the\nimpacts when you don\u0026rsquo;t use those good architectures. Does that make\nsense how I\u0026rsquo;m trying to connect the loops here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 15:19\nI definitely agree on the architecture part and the loop that produces.\nLike. If you understand your software and you approach it the right way\nwith the right fundamentals, you are much better positioned to face\nattacks when they come and face new threats and challenges and\nvulnerabilities as they surface up, because you understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on\nand you have the components in place to address it in a gradual and smart\nway. I\u0026rsquo;m not so sure about the first point that you made with AI, like in\ngenerative AI. Yes. You can now generate more code or.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 15:59\nHave no, that\u0026rsquo;s not what I\u0026rsquo;m saying. I want to use Gen AI to understand\nthe code. I want to use Gen AI to understand the roles, the mappings. So\nimagine a world where you say a prompt that says you are a role based\nassistant, right, or you\u0026rsquo;re going to analyze Kubernetes docker containers,\nright? Let\u0026rsquo;s say, for example, right? Here\u0026rsquo;s the policies. Here\u0026rsquo;s how they\nshould work. Here\u0026rsquo;s what good look like. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I expect to see.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a TCP dump. Here\u0026rsquo;s an output of a mesh network. Here\u0026rsquo;s in the\noutput of what\u0026rsquo;s going on here\u0026rsquo;s analysis of that tool. Now start asking\nthese questions. Right? That is what I think will allow us to do. Because\nyou allow us to understand the context of what\u0026rsquo;s happening. Even more\ninterestingly sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 16:47\nThe problem with it is when you\u0026rsquo;re using Gen AI to generate tests or an\nimage, and you have four fingers in that image, it is okay. Or you have few.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 17:02\nBut just to clarify this, I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that the Genai creates the image.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m saying Genai validates the image creation and helps to create\nthe pull request. That\u0026rsquo;s a bit different, right? It\u0026rsquo;s like I\u0026rsquo;m saying, here\u0026rsquo;s my\nstandard for what my image should look like, right? Here\u0026rsquo;s the stuff of the\nimage. Analyze those two and give me analysis. It\u0026rsquo;s very different. And\nfrom the analysis, you can create pull requests. So there\u0026rsquo;s always a human\nin a loop. What I\u0026rsquo;m making is I\u0026rsquo;m making the human ten x 100 x more\nefficient to understand what\u0026rsquo;s happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 17:37\nI think if you\u0026rsquo;re creating, if you need an AI to explain your system to\nyou\u0026rsquo;re already in a dangerous position. First of all, the AI can be helpful\nand I\u0026rsquo;m not against using it, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s the right way to go about\nit. Like if you\u0026rsquo;ve created something that is chaotic or messy and it\u0026rsquo;s hard\nto understand. I think that\u0026rsquo;s the problem in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 18:02\nYou have that today. Like you guys run on AWS, right? Sorry? You run on\nAWS. For example, what cloud do you run for? AWS? Are you telling me\nthat your IAM policies are absolutely matched to a T? To the permissions\nthat you guys use in your application?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 18:22\nMost of the permissions that we enforce aren\u0026rsquo;t in the IAM policies. A lot of\nthem are in the application level. And we do some doc fooding and we use\nour own policy engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 18:31\nBut have you list get a list, man. Of every single permission and every\nsingle thing that it\u0026rsquo;s allowed. It\u0026rsquo;s really hard to do because it\u0026rsquo;s so complex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 18:42\nYou have recursive aspects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 18:44\nI know, but it\u0026rsquo;s not impossible. It\u0026rsquo;s just complex. Right. The problem is, if\nyou take Im.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 18:50\nRules, the problem is impossible. Like there\u0026rsquo;s the halting problem. If you\nhave something, a system that is complex enough and you have enough\nconnections, then it might take forever to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 19:01\nIterate on again, take Im rules. Right. It\u0026rsquo;s not a very complex problem.\nRight. You have a bunch of permissions to a bunch of assets to a bunch of\nresources. Right. The problem is that the way it\u0026rsquo;s designed, it promotes\noverprivileging, right. Even if you try to underprivileged and the reasons\nwhy, it\u0026rsquo;s very hard to take. Here\u0026rsquo;s my role. I want to understand exactly\nwhat was the intent of that role, and I want to analyze the usage of that\npolicy. And that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m seeing now. That starts to be possible. It was\nclosely impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 19:33\nI think what you\u0026rsquo;re suggesting might be doable, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s a lesser\noption to building it right in the first place. And if you know how you\nassign them, and if you know that you have tests that you run that check\nfor them every time you change your policy, every time you change your\ncode, then you have a much easier time making sure that you\u0026rsquo;re meeting\nyour own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 20:02\nI agree, but look, maybe you guys pull it off, but I have to say that most im\npolicies that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen, when you go to the details, in fact, I will even take\nit to another level, right. Your im policies, okay, you have one or do you\nhave ten or 15 policies in your application?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 20:20\nIn the application or when you run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 20:22\nWhen you AWS environment, do you have one or do you have 15 dynamic?\nDo you give one policy or you have several?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 20:30\nWe have several, and I\u0026rsquo;d say no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 20:32\nBut for the same application, for the same container, for the same sort of\nexecution environment, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 20:38\nSo, first of all, it depends if we\u0026rsquo;re talking about the infrastructure level\nthere, we try to minimize the amount of policy enforcement, or we\u0026rsquo;re\ntalking about the application level where you have more complexity. And\nthere I also talk about customers that we have. There you have policies\nand rules in the thousands and even tens of thousands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 20:59\nYeah. Okay, well, the infrastructure ones, if you think about it again, I\u0026rsquo;m\njust playing with devil\u0026rsquo;s advocate here, but your application, when he runs,\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t need all the privileges that he\u0026rsquo;s been given to, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 21:14\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 21:14\nSo if you look at the intersection of every single privilege that you have in\nan Im policy, just for this example, right? So in principle, you should have\nlots of policies, right? In fact, your policy should almost change depending\non the application is doing. But the complexity level of doing that today is\ntoo great because we don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand all those permutations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 21:34\nI think one of the main points that I\u0026rsquo;m trying to surface here is that if\nyou\u0026rsquo;re trying to do it through the cloud IAM, you\u0026rsquo;re going to have a bad\ntime because it\u0026rsquo;s not meant for that. It\u0026rsquo;s meant for how you connect the\nbuilding blocks that you have, how you connect a database to your elastic\ncomputing, how you connect your lambdas to your buckets. That\u0026rsquo;s the\nlevel of sophistication that the IAM policies in AWS were meant to solve.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re not solving for application level roles. They\u0026rsquo;re not solving for\nquotas and behaviors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 22:09\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the thing, right? If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a solution that addresses that\ntoo, right. Where you went to have let me phrase what you\u0026rsquo;re saying is\nthat at that level, you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough context, right. The application to\ngive you context, because the application is where the action is, right? So\nby design, you are over provisioning the infrastructure because you don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave enough context, because by design, you need to have as much\nprivileges as the maximum of what you need once you provide application\nlayer on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 22:37\nRight? So you need to at each level. So first of all, you can improve that\nby breaking into small more microservices, but there\u0026rsquo;s a point where it\nloses efficiency or efficacy. But yeah, you are right. In the end of the day,\nthere will be things that you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to enforce with the right\ngranularity outside of the application layer. Only in the application layer,\nyou\u0026rsquo;ll have the full context. And then that\u0026rsquo;s why I start with saying with\ncloud native applications, to actually be secure, you have to go into the\ncode, you have to understand it, and you have to absolutely in the first\nplace to enable the level of security that you need. And building your\nauthentication and authorization correctly into your application code as\ntime progresses is becoming the most critical front that you have to\nprotecting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 23:34\nI agree. And actually I\u0026rsquo;m doubling down on that because I\u0026rsquo;m saying that\nmy application decisions or my application aware or even user context\naware decisions that I\u0026rsquo;m making need to trickle all the way down. Right?\nAnd if they trickle all the way down across those layers, you get a huge\namount of defense in death. Because it means that even a blind spot over\nhere on code doesn\u0026rsquo;t cause a huge amount of problem. Because the\nproblem is if you don\u0026rsquo;t take the application specific knowledge that you\u0026rsquo;re\njust describing from the zero trust who you are, where you come from,\nwhat you want to do, all that knowledge that you can have and you trickle\ndown to all the roles and policies across your stack, you end up over\nprovisioning. So you almost end up with a pyramid right of permissions.\nRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 24:22\nWhere the reality is it should be like that. In fact, it should be like this.\nRight? But my point is that Gen AI can help us to solve that problem\nbecause the reason why you don\u0026rsquo;t want to go to IAM policies is because\nit\u0026rsquo;s a fucking shit show, right? Because you hardly understand what\u0026rsquo;s\ngoing on in there. Right? And then we limit it to some of the big primitives\njust because of the level of complexity. But it\u0026rsquo;s still massively\noverprivileged, right? So if you look at access to S three buckets, you go, I\ngive S three bucket access to this part. But actually the user only needs\naccess to that little bit over there. Right? Why does he have access to the\nwhole bucket? Why does he have access to all of Kubernetes? Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 25:01\nI think the stuff you guys do is great because I think we need to push that\ndown. But also we need to start explaining the intent of the rules and we\nneed to explaining reality in a language that makes sense to the multiple\noperators all the way to the business owners. In fact, all the way I agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 25:21\nWith that, but I think we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t trust or expect AI to do it for us. I think\nas engineers and as security practitioners, we should put in the effort to\ndesign those understandings into what we\u0026rsquo;re building in the first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 25:39\nNo, no, but again, I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that you let AI build the whole thing.\nThis is like Jarvis, right? It\u0026rsquo;s like a copilot. It\u0026rsquo;s like the ability to have\naugmented reality understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 25:50\nThis reminds me a lot about the talks between developers about clean\ncode, against documenting the code. Yeah, you can take a really complex\ncode and document it really good or ask AI to document it for you. And\nthen you probably understand 90% of what this code is doing. This is one\nway to work. It works. AI know how to explain code. It may mistake a bit\nfor 10%. Those 10% may be really critical. But mostly it will do know\nwhat this code going to do, the other way to do it and I think that we at\npermit pushing to this way is like clean code. Let\u0026rsquo;s do with no\ndocumentation a little bit. When the code explains itself, when the\npermissions and the policy explain itself, you don\u0026rsquo;t get into the IAM shit\nshow and you need Jarvis to explain it to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 26:59\nYou can write it in a way that it will be so understandable. You don\u0026rsquo;t want\nthe AI, you just read it and you understand it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 27:07\nFor example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 27:11\nYou said you have a lot of machines. You need to get access only to one\nmachine. So if you are using ArbAC, it is very difficult because you need to\nhave a lot of rules for each and every machines and it\u0026rsquo;s very complex. But\nif you are using REBAC or ABAC, you can have a new attribute. This is my\nmachine. You have access only to it because you created it, because the\nadmin gave you permission to this machine. And then it\u0026rsquo;s really simple.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need AI, you don\u0026rsquo;t need Jarvis. You just read your permissions.\nYou know what you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 27:57\nSo interesting thing. And look, this is the same thing with Agile, right? No\ndocumentation, right? So let me ask the question here. If you had clean\ncode and I gave you really good documentation, really good architecture\ndiagrams, I will give you visual representations of what that code is doing,\nright? In fact, I will give you a visual representation of what that code is\ndoing plus the code that he calls and he calls it. Would you want it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 28:22\nIt can be nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 28:24\nNo, that\u0026rsquo;s a simple question. Would you like it or you would not like it?\nWould you add value or not add value to have that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 28:29\nIt depends on what your current situation is. If you already have those\nthings, you don\u0026rsquo;t need more of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 28:35\nNot saying you don\u0026rsquo;t, I\u0026rsquo;m saying you have clean code, you have a really\nnice architecture code that is you can argue that is easy to understand,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 28:43\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 28:43\nFor the big picture, a diagram is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 28:45\nAlways nice, but even about that function, right? Like that function, about\nthat function as.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 28:50\nA developer, I want to see for myself if it\u0026rsquo;s a function, a small piece and it\u0026rsquo;s\nclean and I would love to see for myself this is me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 29:02\nThat function doesn\u0026rsquo;t work in isolation, right? That function is called by\nother functions, is integrated as a flow here, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 29:08\nSo for the big picture, give me what you have for the small picture, as a\nsecurity person, I want to see for myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 29:17\nSure. My point here is that the reason why you\u0026rsquo;re rationalizing that you\ndon\u0026rsquo;t need or you don\u0026rsquo;t want the documentation, the architecture diagram\nright, is because at the moment it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to do, it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to\nmaintain, it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to keep in sync, it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to version control.\nIt actually takes away from a lot of the work you do. Right, but I\u0026rsquo;ll give\nyou an example from a security point of view. When we do code reviews,\nright? So you guys ship code, right? Let\u0026rsquo;s say you release ten times a day,\nfive times a day, whatever number that every five minutes, right? Amazing,\nright? Pretty cool, right. By the way, it\u0026rsquo;s not practical to have a security\nperson review every line of code that you ship, right? It\u0026rsquo;s not practical.\nRight. Unless you have one to one developers. Right, not practical. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 30:11\nThe developer is the security person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 30:14\nExactly. Developers, security person, right, basically. So how do you know\nwhich ones to look at?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 30:21\nSo I think here, maybe I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make this into a permit pitch, but I\nthink it\u0026rsquo;d be worthwhile to give a little bit more color about what we do.\nSo with permit, we\u0026rsquo;re providing you a couple of things. First of all, we\u0026rsquo;re\nproviding policy as code. So you don\u0026rsquo;t work with arbitrary code that you\nwrite, you work with dedicated policy engines with languages that are\nmeant like Regal for OPA and Cedar for WS Cedar. So you manage your\npolicies in code in ways that are also easy to manage and easy to test and\nbenchmark. So first of all, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to have a security person go\nabout checking all that code because you can have tests that check that\ncode when it changes and you can have tests that check the application\nagainst that code when the application changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 31:13\nAnd then we take it another step up and we provide low code, no code\ninterfaces. So when you write policy as code with us, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to\nwrite it as code directly. You use simplified interfaces. Think about a table\nwith checkboxes for permissions, think about connecting points to\ndescribe relationships. So these are really simple interfaces that I like to\nsay a monkey can use, or even a product manager, if they\u0026rsquo;re smart\nenough. Ironically, by the way, product managers are the ones that like the\njoke the most. In the end of the day, when you. Look at the interfaces\nthemselves. They\u0026rsquo;re so simple that everyone around the team can use them\nand they become part of the documentation. So you have the code itself\nthat\u0026rsquo;s maintained in Git and that\u0026rsquo;s your single source of truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 31:58\nBut simplified interfaces on top that make the conversation easier, make\nthe investigating, exploring easier. And we think that in the end of the day,\nthere are two points here. A, you have to go into the code if you want to\nhave any protection and B, you need to work with the right tools and the\nright abstractions. So it\u0026rsquo;d be simple for everyone around the table to work\nwith this. And I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that AI can\u0026rsquo;t come into the mix. It definitely\ncan. But I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go so fast to rely on it completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 32:31\nBut I never said that you jumped to an extreme. Right. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that\nwe\u0026rsquo;re going to let AI write the code, write the policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 32:38\nYou sure you\u0026rsquo;re not saying that? Because that\u0026rsquo;s a great debate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 32:41\nNo. Well, I think that\u0026rsquo;s wrong. Right. And that\u0026rsquo;s never going to work\nbecause we don\u0026rsquo;t allow that anywhere. We don\u0026rsquo;t allow a super genius\nengineer to have uncontrolled access to production just because he can. In\nfact, we now know that backfires because although the person can do\ncertain things, in a way I\u0026rsquo;m a massive fan of clean code, right? In fact, I\u0026rsquo;m\na massive fan of code that you can argue is redundant, but is easy to read,\neasy to understand, easy to process. So I would always prefer to have code\nthat might be more verbose, but is actually simpler to maintain, simpler to\ndo than code. That is freaking crazy optimized. Like, if you ever do some\nstuff in Scala, you can write shit in Scala that is like, what the hell is going\non here? Right? Even the guys or perl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 33:26\nOkay, but I think the readability understanding of code is very important.\nLook, what I really like about what you guys are in permit IO is that\nyou\u0026rsquo;re raising the like you basically bring a whole level of abstractions.\nAnd in fact, what you\u0026rsquo;re doing is really cool is that you are starting to\nallow the role base to be maintained by the people who understand the\nintent of the application. Right? So you allow the business owner to start\nto own almost the role base. And the stuff that\u0026rsquo;s happening in there, which\nI think is really powerful. My key points here is that but even that is still a\nbig layer of abstraction, right? There\u0026rsquo;s still a layer of analysis that you\nneed to put on top of it. You make it easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 34:09\nSo the reality is that any system that uses equivalent of technology that\nyou guys are building is always going to be easier to analyze, easier to\nprocess, easier to do, versus a system that authorization is sprinkled\nthroughout the whole thing and is a massive mess to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 34:24\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 34:25\nUsually what I like about it that usually when you make things more\nsecure, it\u0026rsquo;s harder to maintain because security adds guidelines and walls\nthat prevent you doing things that are not secure enough. And in permit\nwe are trying to do it simpler and more secure in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 34:51\nThe same and I think this is value, right? And that\u0026rsquo;s something you guys\nneed to run with. That\u0026rsquo;s how I position security as a CISO. I said the\nthings that we want to do in security is to allow the business to go faster,\nright? Is to allow the business to be more optimized. So it\u0026rsquo;s almost like\nsecurity becomes an enabler. So you don\u0026rsquo;t have this complexity, right? You\nbasically now have these building blocks which I think going back to the\npoint here, cloud native security tools that has a big advantage, right? In\nthat model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 35:23\nI want to get to a point you said I don\u0026rsquo;t want a junior developer get\nuncontrolled access to production. I think one of the point that cloud\nnative and light is what does that mean uncontrolled access to\nproduction? Because non developers should have direct access to our\ncloud environment, it\u0026rsquo;s irrelevant for them in cloud native. They should\nhave access to deploy code maybe, but they should never get access to S\nthree bucket, right? This bucket is supposed to have changed access from\nthe application level permission, right? So if we are keeping the pillar\nseparately to each other, every function can make sure that they are\nsecuring what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 36:12\nThey need to now. Okay, but here\u0026rsquo;s a question. Can that developer write\ncode that then access the S three bucket directly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 36:18\nThey can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 36:20\nThey can. Of course they can. But how do you prevent that from\nhappening?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 36:26\nBecause in cloud native environments, usually all the deployment part, all\nthe chain that taking this code from repository to the cloud environment is\nsomething that\u0026rsquo;s controlled not by developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 36:40\nOkay? But when the code arrives there, if I\u0026rsquo;m the developer, can I write\ncode that gets nicely deployed and when C heads gives the final container\naccess the S three bucket directly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 36:52\nYeah, exactly. So that\u0026rsquo;s the point of separation of concern in this pillar of\nsecurity, right? So developer is writing code, the code specifically that\ngetting access or accessing S three bucket is secure, right? It\u0026rsquo;s secure if\nit\u0026rsquo;s fit with the application level security, which again in a good word is\nsomething that\u0026rsquo;s controlled by responsible for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 37:17\nSo that code is going to run in a lambda function or it\u0026rsquo;s going to run in a\ncontainer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 37:22\nJust a second now. So we are securing the pillar of the code. We know that\nthe code that are trying to get access to an S three bucket is code that is\nsafe. We check that with let\u0026rsquo;s say static analysis, security, maybe even with\nsome infrastructure as code analysis, right? So for example, tools like\nKicks and Checkoff can tell us hey, here is an infrastructure that not looks\ngood and then you as a CISO do not need to have code review on all the\ncode. You can have a code review where is sensitive as a CISO. So in that\nexample, the infrastructure, right? So we\u0026rsquo;re securing the first filler the\ncode, then we are going to the container itself, the container as a\ncontainer, again, does not have access to the S three bucket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 38:12\nThe configuration of this container as an access of S three bucket. And\nagain, this is something that you know where you are securing this level of\nseparation of concern. When you are getting to the cloud environment,\nyou only need to take a look on the previous section of configuration and\nin a cloud native way where everything is declarative. You always have an\ninsight who has an access in the point that is relevant to you as a CISO.\nRight? And if you need to do some code review for the developer, you\nknow, potentially hypothetically, right, with the cloud native helpful of\neverything being declarative, everything declared as code, you know\nwhere to open the incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 39:01\nBut if you go back to the when I joined you guys were talking about the\nfact that one of the things you need to protect is the fact that the\ncontainer itself might have access to a lot of resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 39:09\nExactly. And this is exactly the trend in cloud native. So for example, I\nwant to take a look on the trend, the eBPF, have you heard on eBPF?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 39:19\nNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 39:20\nSo eBPF is a tool that is very trending in cloud native.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 39:23\nNow you probably heard of Isolvent and some other companies that are\nusing that for service mesh and other level of cloud native introspection\ninto software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 39:38\nHow do you spell it? EBPs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 39:40\nEbpf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 39:42\nOkay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 39:43\nExtended Berkeley packet filters, I think I heard that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 39:52\nSo if you think about traditional application they were mixing or\ncomplexing the way you as a CISO can get an access on permissions on\nthings that happened. The cloud native way is helping you to separate\nwhat you need to inspect, what you need to analyze, what you need to the\nincident you need to open for the very relevant concern that you have now.\nRight. So you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry anymore on all your runtime security or\non the kernel that you are running on. You can make sure that everything\nis secure there. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about because the version is\nsecure and then you have to worry on the piece of code that have this most\nsensitive part of what you need to do. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 40:42\nAnd in my opinion, this is the way that CISOs should start look at the\ncloud native way with new eyes, with eyes that helping developers use\ncloud native to help them. If security engineers will continue to look on\nsoftware as one manolite piece with one backlog of endless findings or\nendless incidents or endless areas to inspect, they will lose the benefits of\ncloud native software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 41:15\nYeah, but by the way, just a very important point. Everything you\u0026rsquo;re\ndescribing there, if it\u0026rsquo;s the security team that is driving that, it\u0026rsquo;s already a\nlosing battle, right? Like everything you talk about there from going that\ncloud native journey is a journey that the dev teams have to do. We have to\nsupport them from a security point of view. But it\u0026rsquo;s not the security team\nthat is going to do that because it\u0026rsquo;s the dev teams that need to do that.\nAnd this is why sometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll argue with some of my peers, I say, if you\ndon\u0026rsquo;t have a good CI pipeline, for example, if your engineer team is not\ndoing that, then don\u0026rsquo;t fund tools. Fund that. Help them. If you have a\nbudget, help them to build proper pipelines. Help them to go proper cloud\nnative, because that\u0026rsquo;s the hard part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 42:02\nSecuring it becomes it\u0026rsquo;s almost like these are tools for developers, right?\nThese are tools for them. We making their lives easier. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 42:12\nAnd I think a next step there maybe to also kind of simplify the things that\nGabriel said. So the idea is that as a security, as a team, as a CISO, you\nwant to enable and empower your developers. You want to encourage\nthem to work with security and don\u0026rsquo;t want to slow them down. And you\nthen you enable security to plug in via the right tools and by applying\ndecoupling. So, for example, if a developer is now setting enforcement into\ntheir code, into their app, so they\u0026rsquo;ll use policy as code and they\u0026rsquo;ll have\nenforcement points in their code that will check if, for example, that\napplication can talk to that s three bucket. For example, the example used\nbefore, can that application in this context, behalf of this user, is it allowed\nto go to that s three bucket?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 43:04\nAnd initially, you let the developers set the policies themselves. So what the\ndeveloper is responsible for is setting the enforcement and connecting it to\nthe correct tools and mechanisms. Once those are in place, the security\nteam can come in with their own interfaces and say, oh, this is the policy\nwe\u0026rsquo;ve been using so far. It\u0026rsquo;s not good enough. I want to add more rules,\nmore limitations, more capabilities on top you\u0026rsquo;re missing without asking\nthe developer to change everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 43:32\nYeah, but the thing about this is you actually are so close. This is why I\u0026rsquo;m\ngoing to nudge the geni. You\u0026rsquo;re so close because the real decision has to\nbe done by the product people, by the business people, right. Because\nthat\u0026rsquo;s the key. And what you have is now this is what I\u0026rsquo;m saying, that the\npower of the gen AI is that allows you to translate all these layers based\non reality to the wide audiences. Because the thing you described in a\nweird way, it\u0026rsquo;s not what the developer wants or cares. It\u0026rsquo;s not what the\ntechnical manager is doing is what the business owner who owns the\nproject, who owns the risk, who owns the development, right? In a way,\nthey\u0026rsquo;re the person who controls the pipeline, they control the roadmap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 44:17\nThey are the ones that in fact, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to intersect my world now. So,\nfor example, you need to bring now the risk analysis and say, hey, if in this\ndevelopment environment you have this policy and you do this, you do this,\nyou have these risks and you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to accept these risks. And\nit\u0026rsquo;s when we can give the business risks to the business owners that things\nchange. And in a weird way, you guys have made such a great stride there\nbecause you\u0026rsquo;re now starting to describe roles and permissions as business\nfunctions, right? Which is really freaking cool, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 44:51\nAnd I bet that some of your customers are actually on the tech teams, are\nactually the business teams, because they\u0026rsquo;re the ones who get lots of\nbenefit from it, which is the big challenge I always give to security tools\nbecause I say the only people buying your tool are the security guys, then\nyou\u0026rsquo;re already missing a chunk of the market. But the thing now is to\nconnect that with the risk, right? Because if you really want to and this is\nwhere going back to the cloud native right. The risk profiles of running\nstuff in cloud native environments with good designs, with good\narchitectures, with good mappings is very different from the risk profile of\nrunning on an EC two instance that needs to be maintained or something\nin your data center or a lambda function or XYZ over there. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 45:33\nThat connection is really interesting because we finally have the ability to\nmake the business owners and here\u0026rsquo;s the interesting thing, the ability to\nmake the clients aware of it. See, what I don\u0026rsquo;t like as a buyer is I don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave access to that data from the tools that, let\u0026rsquo;s say my stakeholders,\nright, which is the whole freaking business, right? I buy it and I want to\nstart pushing those standards down. So in a way, I want to reward the\nmarket that does a good job versus the market that doesn\u0026rsquo;t do a good job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 46:06\nIf we\u0026rsquo;re doing an evaluation of a day of the business of three companies, I\nwould love if the company that does good role based security has a really\ngood grip on their permissions and roles, we should be able to reward that\ncompany with a sell versus a company who\u0026rsquo;s not doing anything. But from\na marketing, it looks great. It might even be ISO compliant and have every\nfreaking compliance in the book, but it\u0026rsquo;s not actually doing it properly. So\nif you guys can go that extra mile up and then start connect with the\nowners, the problem you have is the message is different almost every time\nbecause the message is now context specific. And that\u0026rsquo;s the bit that in the\npast didn\u0026rsquo;t scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 46:49\nGo ahead, Gabriel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 46:50\nI think that at the end, although as developers we want to develop for fun\nand develop software for software at the end we need to do business,\nright? Of course we develop software for business and the more we can\ncloser to deliver business value faster, we\u0026rsquo;re getting better software, right?\nAnd I think that\u0026rsquo;s one of the main points that drives the cloud native\ntrends. We can deliver software much faster. We can deliver it because we\nseparate the concern of infrastructure and code. We can deliver it because\nwe declare everything and deploying it in second and all that. We just\nmake all the functions closer. That\u0026rsquo;s our main goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 47:35\nDo you still see clients that question that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 47:41\nWe see a lot of people that don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily understand that fully. Most\npeople are still and most companies are still struggling just to do the.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 47:50\nBasics, most bigger problems, right? Then it\u0026rsquo;s like they\u0026rsquo;re not even ready\nto talk about role based security because they can\u0026rsquo;t even connect the dots,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 48:03\nWhen they come to us, they\u0026rsquo;re ready to talk about role based because\nthat\u0026rsquo;s often why they come to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 48:10\nAnd by then surely they are on a path to understanding cloud native,\nright? Because one maturity surely leads the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 48:17\nSo I think there are different roles around the space here. So I think we\nneed to specialize, we need developers to focus on building good software\nand meeting the standards that are required by them. We need the security\npeople to set the policies, set the workflow and connect it to the business.\nWe need to enable the business folks to communicate what they actually\nneed. And we need to enable companies as a whole to be able to adopt\nthese concepts without having to learn too much. And that means that we\nalso need to simplify things. Maybe AI can help them simplify things, but I\nthink better is tools that have simplification baked into them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 48:59\nIf the self working with the tool can understand, then he can use the AI,\nbut he won\u0026rsquo;t be dependent on it and he\u0026rsquo;ll be able to do more things than\njust that little thing that the AI is doing for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 49:13\nMan, here\u0026rsquo;s the thing, you know that word you said is one of the most\nimportant words, simplify. In fact, you should put down a homepage of\nyour website because there\u0026rsquo;s a great vision that a friend of mine has and\nhe says in security, our job is to simplify the business. And I completely\nagree with him. When we do security, right, we make the business simple,\nwe make it efficient and I think that\u0026rsquo;s a great property. And yes, going to\ncloud native simplifies things right at the end of the day because it\nremoves complexity. Although that said, you could have no idea what\nyou\u0026rsquo;re doing, you\u0026rsquo;re going to make it more complex but then you have\ndifferent problems, right? But I think that word simplify is very important,\nright? Because I think that\u0026rsquo;s where you add real business value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 49:53\nThe interesting question is measure that, but I think you guys should run\nwith that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 49:58\nIt made me think or do you want to finish this point?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 50:02\nNo, you can take it. We have just a couple of minutes left and some people\nsent me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 50:08\nYeah, there\u0026rsquo;s a question from Kieran. Kieran, I made you a co host if you\nwant to ask that question, because that\u0026rsquo;s quite a cool question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 6 - 50:15\nYeah, it was around the bit with regards to when you were saying around\nensuring that from a developer point of view that you\u0026rsquo;re baking in, that\nyou build it, you own it kind of concept, that agile methodology. So it\u0026rsquo;s\nkind of almost agreeing what Dennis was saying around it, to say, how do\nyou enforce that? How do you enable that to make sure that cultural shift\nactually happens and the developers do own it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 50:52\nYeah. So I think in the end of the day, it\u0026rsquo;s separation of responsibilities and\nit\u0026rsquo;s about enabling one another. And you want your developers to be able\nto focus on being good developers. And if you have the ability to plug in\nthe security capabilities either baked into their work or it\u0026rsquo;s things that you\ncan connect later in a decoupled way, then that shift motion happens more\neasily. If you go to your developers and tell them, oh, you need to manage\neverything, you need to bake all of the security, then some of them would\ntake you off on that and do it, but for most of them, it will be a lot of\nfriction. It\u0026rsquo;s really hard to telescope and cover both areas at the same\ntime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 51:38\nLike a developer, in the end of the day, needs to be able to zoom into their\ncode, really get into the zone and build it right. And it\u0026rsquo;s hard for them to\nthink about all the macro things that happen, but if you tell them, oh, this\nis how you connect to the macro picture when you\u0026rsquo;re doing, for example,\nwith what we do when you\u0026rsquo;re building permissions, don\u0026rsquo;t put the policy\ninto the code, don\u0026rsquo;t have anything regarding that. There just set points\nwhere you\u0026rsquo;re describing what\u0026rsquo;s happening and connect that to another\nservice that will bring in the policy. Suddenly the developer has the ability\nto cognitively contain this. They say, oh, I know, I want to build this suffix\nsecure, so I\u0026rsquo;ll make sure I\u0026rsquo;ll set all the enforcement points correctly and fill\nthem with all the context that they need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 52:25\nBut they don\u0026rsquo;t need to start extending their mind and thinking about the\nmacro picture of what all the different policies may be that will be applied\nto this application later. That\u0026rsquo;s something that will be impossible. So by\nsimplifying it for both sides, like making it focused enough for the\ndevelopers, making it approachable enough for the CISO suite and for the\nother and the business owners, we can have everyone chime in together\nand build this without slowing down each other. But it really starts by\nunderstanding the focus point for each one on the team and how we\nconnect these things in the right way with the best practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 53:05\nI think you\u0026rsquo;re going to say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 53:09\nNo, I can say that we are almost done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 53:13\nI\u0026rsquo;ll give you a couple of minutes more if you guys could. The only thing I\nwould say, Kieran, and just to ora\u0026rsquo;s point, I think it\u0026rsquo;s very important to\nunderstand who\u0026rsquo;s making what decision because I sometimes think in\nthese conversations we talk about the developer as an abstraction concept\nand the developers have very little power in most places, right? The\ndevelopers are executing on a roadmap. So you need to understand who is\nproviding the technical leadership. Because for example, even or when\nyou\u0026rsquo;re saying if you go to developer and you say that they go of course I\nwould love to be able to manage my permissions in this way. But he needs\nto be given that brief. It\u0026rsquo;s a non functional requirement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 53:50\nA lot of the times that needs to be in a roadmap for that to be in a\nroadmap that needs to be mapped to the business person. Now, sometimes\nwhoever controls the roadmap has enough power to push you through.\nBut I think in this case we need to find who is the person that\u0026rsquo;s making\nthose decisions. A who\u0026rsquo;s making the technical decision and who\u0026rsquo;s making\nthe business decision because those are the ones that will drive it. The\nperson making the technical decision is the one need to say the way we do\npermissions is ridiculous. We need something that scales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 54:15\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a model, here\u0026rsquo;s a pattern, go evaluate it, figure out the best one to\ndo it and by the way, I\u0026rsquo;m giving you time to do that and the person making\nthe business decision need to go yes, I support that because without that\nthe developer won\u0026rsquo;t have the time, right? And that\u0026rsquo;s why sometimes it\nhappens, right? My point is that I want to start to influence those\ndevelopers to have the time by being able to reward the companies who\nare doing it right. Because a lot of the times that business person is\nconnected to somebody who says do the clients care? Do the clients\nunderstand? Are we losing sales, are we losing market share? Are we\ndelivering what we need for our stakeholders? So you need to influence\nthat, right? So that the developer are giving the time to basically then\nimplement those solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 55:02\nI definitely agree. I think you can create a virtuous cycle from that. Once\ndevelopers are empowered, they\u0026rsquo;ll empower back the security and vice\nversa. And that\u0026rsquo;s why we actually started when we started was talking\nabout the different levels, the different zones of protection that you have\nand why you need to care about the code, especially in cloud native. And if\nyou do that means that you care about your developers and empowering\nthem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 55:27\nSo I want to give you one more idea before we finish. One of the things\nthat we start to talk about, and there\u0026rsquo;s a great podcast I heard recently\nwhere Gary McGraw was saying that one of the biggest challenges that\nwe have is we need to scale threat modeling. And I couldn\u0026rsquo;t agree more.\nAnd I think you guys and this world that we talk about can play a big part\nof it because at the moment when we do threat models, people go, let me\ndesign the system. Right. See, that\u0026rsquo;s the problem. It\u0026rsquo;s all nice having no\ndiagrams in your clinic code, but if I want to do a thread modeling system,\nI need to understand how it works. Right? I think you guys are sitting on\nsomething because you start to have an understanding of how the app\nworks, how they behave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 56:08\nSo I think you can be a key piece of the puzzle in the ability to scale threat\nmodeling. And threat modeling is one of those practices that we won the\nbattle. Nobody will argue that threat modeling is not healthy. Threat\nmodeling should not be done. The problem is how to do it at scale, how to\ndo it in a way that scales is consistent, that we leverage, that we don\u0026rsquo;t\nrequire everybody in the team to be a security expert. Right. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t\nscale. And role based security, by the way, is where threat model tends to\nfail, because by then, we can\u0026rsquo;t really understand a lot of the things. Right?\nSo a clean role based environment is what allows you to then start\nunderstanding the threats of the system and ask really good questions and\nunderstand the side effects and then put countermeasures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 56:53\nSo I think threat modeling is definitely an area that going back just to the\ncloud native, right? Like the thread model of a cloud native application\nlooks very different than the thread model of a non cloud native\napplication. Right. So the threads are different, the things are different, et\ncetera. So, yeah, just dropping the idea to you guys because I think you\u0026rsquo;re\ngoing to see a lot of innovation in that world in the next six months to a\nyear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 57:16\nYeah, for sure. It\u0026rsquo;s actually, some of this is our features that we\u0026rsquo;re already\nworking on. So it\u0026rsquo;s part of our audit log system. So one of the cool things\nabout our product is we generate audit logs automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 57:26\nYeah, it\u0026rsquo;s like in gold, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 57:28\nAnd we also have the ability to in anonymized way to understand the\nbehavior of each of the users through those audit logs so you can generate\nbehavioral analytics and anomaly detection and other capabilities. These\nare already things that we\u0026rsquo;re looking to bring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 57:44\nYou know, who\u0026rsquo;s going to pay for that? The business guys, for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 57:49\nAnd who\u0026rsquo;s going to enjoy it? The developer guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 57:53\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the sweet spot, right? So one of the things I say a lot these days\nis that the security team is one of the few teams sometimes that can make\nthis happen because we sometimes the only ones intersection. The sweet\nspot for security is to find these added values. So you can drive decisions\nand you can get people on the table that otherwise maybe wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be on\nthe same table. Because it\u0026rsquo;s almost like one of those a lot of the players\nwould like it, but they don\u0026rsquo;t feel the pain or they don\u0026rsquo;t see how it could be\ndone, where, from a security point of view, we can see the path. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 58:20\nThe key is to have those benefits, to say, look, if I do this and I get the\nsecurity that I need, because that\u0026rsquo;s my mandate, the developers get a\nmuch better life. The business analysts get a better way. And we\u0026rsquo;re able to\ngive these business insights to these dudes over there, which, by the way,\nare usually the ones that have a lot of budget because they tend to be very\nconnected to the outside world. I e the places where the business generates\nthat\u0026rsquo;s. And again, that\u0026rsquo;s where I think Genai will collect a lot of those dots\nthat in the past were very hard to scale again at an organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 58:51\nCool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 58:52\nAll right, guys, any final thoughts on comments on this session?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 58:58\nNot for me. I really enjoyed the conversation. I think we delved into some\nreally interesting points and things that are relevant now and become also\neven more relevant down the road. And I thank you for inviting me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 59:12\nCool. All right, guys. One ask for you guys is like we now have done a\ncouple of these. One of my frustration is that the Open Security Summit\nhas such an amazing set of content for some of these things. And for\nexample, some of the sessions you guys done also are like a master class,\nfor example, of how to think about this. We need to find a way to package\nthat up. I need to find a way that sometimes I can go to an engineer or a\nbusiness analyst or somebody from my team or somebody from other part\nof the business and say, look, just go there and read that and see that. The\nquestion is, how do we package it up? Right. In a nice roadmap. So let\u0026rsquo;s\nsee how we can collaborate on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 59:53\nFor sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 59:54\nBecause I think the space you guys in is very important. Right. It\u0026rsquo;s the key\nway to scale security. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 01:00:00\nBy the way, Dennis, we just released two blog posts that is result from our\nlast conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 01:00:06\nOh, cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 01:00:08\nYeah, I\u0026rsquo;ll send you the link.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 01:00:09\nYeah, tag me on LinkedIn, man. My inbox, just for the record, is a shit\nshow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 01:00:19\nYou manage your policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 01:00:21\nExactly. I need a bot for that. Brilliant, guys. Good stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 01:00:25\nAbsolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 01:00:26\nI\u0026rsquo;ll see you in the next one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 01:00:28\nThank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2023/mini-summits/Oct/DevSecOps/","event":"mini-summit","expirydate":-62135596800,"facebook":null,"fuzzywordcount":10900,"hey_summit":"https://www.linkedin.com/events/7110652455767408640","image":null,"job_title":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752075784,"layout":"","linkedin":null,"notes":null,"objectID":"53e0ff0ceffb977db2ca2f6b4e7c3e00","organizers":["Dinis Cruz","Gabriel L.

Borders have been closed, airports, hotels and other businesses got shut, the cultural life has been suspended, schools and other educational institutions have been completely switched to remote mode. These unprecedented measures not only depress people from the phycological point of view, but they also disrupt many economies, resulting in mass job losses and raising the probability of widespread hunger.\nWe all want to get out of the house, to reopen the economy and to feel secure again. COVID Safe Paths is a mobile app for digital contact tracing (DCT) sponsored by nonprofit organisation Path Check and developed by a growing global community of engineers, designers, and contributors. The app is based on research originally conducted at the MIT Media Lab. It builds tools that help communities flatten the curve of COVID-19 together.\nDuring this session we will be doing a live Threat Modeling review of the application and collaborate with key “Covid Safe Paths” contributors in helping to improve the security of this open source initiative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"resources\"\u003eResources\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMain

Hi. Welcome to this open security summit session in October 2023.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m going to be talking about a project that I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on all\nmy spare time, which I published a lot of details, but I want to kind of go a\nbit more into the workflows and how it works. And it\u0026rsquo;s basically the idea\nof creating a bot gen AI bot chat GPT, but actually eventually will be\npowered by Bedrock and Bard and all the other vertex AI and basically\nsome of the big gen AI engines LLMs out there. And the idea is to be kind\nof a one stop shop for board directors to talk about cybersecurity. So it\u0026rsquo;s\nabout teaching board members about cybersecurity, actually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 00:52\nIt\u0026rsquo;s about also, for example, allowing new board members or people who\nwant become board members to learn more about cybersecurity and also\nactually allows CISOs and other professionals to talk to board members\nand communicate with it. So kind of what we\u0026rsquo;ve done was kind of created.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s some content here. So this idea started by, hey, let\u0026rsquo;s create some\ncontent for board members that provide information. The problem is kind\nof typical one, right? The problem is you have this, but then what from\nhere should I know about what matters? What\u0026rsquo;s important? How do you\nmake this in context to a particular board member?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:32\nAnd just for context, the problem as a CISO to communicate with board\nmembers or even board members to ask questions down, is that for this to\nreally work, you have to be able to provide something that is actually in\ncontext with that individual\u0026rsquo;s personality, knowledge, culture, language,\nunderstanding, and even conversation, right? Because as they evolve their\nthinking, their understanding, they\u0026rsquo;re going to be asking different\nquestions and they\u0026rsquo;re going to evolve. And to be honest, just about every\nboard member I met, they\u0026rsquo;re very clever, they really sharp, they just might\nnot have it or technology or cybersecurity experience. So we need to plug\nthat in. So the idea is to create Athena. We actually have three bots, but\nI\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through the first one. And the idea of Athena is this\ncybersecurity advisor. So just quickly give you a tour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 02:22\nBasically, you go in here and you say, hey, good morning. Who are you and\nwhat do you do? And then you submit a question. So the coolest thing is\nthat you could see now and this is powered by Touch BT 3.5, by the way, is\nthat it\u0026rsquo;s able to give information. Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m atina your cybersecurity\nadvisors from Cyber Boardroom. Our main purpose is to assist board\nmembers like you with cybersecurity questions and concerns. So what\u0026rsquo;s\ncool about this is say, hey, it\u0026rsquo;s an interaction. So what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to\nfigure out, and this is one of the powers of chat DBT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 02:53\nAnd I really want to stress that if you want to get something out of this\nsession, is about thinking how you can create agents that really augments\ncertain individuals, but also allows to capture knowledge in a way that is\nnow shared with others in a much more effective way, especially in a\nlanguage way. And in fact, with one of the sessions that just happened is\nthat we created a really cool thread model that we passed to try to PPT,\nand then we actually created a game almost like a bot to test developers,\nto test users on that environment, right, which is pretty cool. And that is\nvery developer specific. So here you can say, I\u0026rsquo;m here to help to\nunderstand the cybersecurity challenge and risks within your company. So\nyou can say, okay, hi, and then it\u0026rsquo;s always good to be polite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 03:38\nRemember that it\u0026rsquo;s all about the more polite you are, the more polite it is,\nright? So, again, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to be rude here. So you can say hi, and\nyou can say, okay, I\u0026rsquo;m from, let\u0026rsquo;s say, I think, what was the user I used?\nOh, government, okay. I\u0026rsquo;m from, let\u0026rsquo;s say, UK government organization.\nAnd organization where I need to know what is cybersecurity and how it\napplies to me, right, and how it applies to my world. And you could even\nsay, I\u0026rsquo;m aware that it is very important and all these things are kind of\nrelevant. So if you say, I\u0026rsquo;m aware, it\u0026rsquo;s very important. In a way, the\nAthena, the bot should not start by explaining why cybersecurity is\nimportant. It should say, you\u0026rsquo;re already there. And this is the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 04:41\nThe idea is you create a bot environment, and I will show you in a second\njust how much or how almost easy it was to create these bots at this level.\nSo you basically asked the question and now he\u0026rsquo;s going to say, look, it\u0026rsquo;s\ngreat to have some government organization seeking insights about\ncybersecurity. So he\u0026rsquo;s now start to explain what is cybersecurity? So, you\ncould see, refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, network\nand data from digital attacks and authorized access, right? And then say\nthe concept of governmentization is of importance. And then here\u0026rsquo;s the\nkey points data protection, national security, public trust compliance, and\nregulation that you should know. And then you can start to zoom in. You\ncan say, okay, can you zoom in on data protection?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 05:26\nSo the point here is now you can have an interaction conversation and you\ncan start to basically keep going down in a way. The nice thing of HBT in\nthis case, and this is without even doing a lot of clever prompting, without\na lot of specific areas, he already has quite a lot of basically good set of\ncontent, which is here you can argue that data classification, access,\ncontrols, encryption, these are all really good stuff. So then you could say,\nokay, so what questions should I ask my CISO? Right? And what\u0026rsquo;s cool\nabout this? You could see that he has context and he understands that\nCISO is the Chief Information Security officer. Remember that he still\nunderstands that it\u0026rsquo;s a board member and he cares about cybersecurity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 06:15\nSo now you get some really nice questions that to be honest, I would love\nto be in the receiving end from one of our board members. And one of the\nfeatures we\u0026rsquo;re going to add in the future is actually to be able to\ncustomize these based on the user, but also be able to have a workflow\nwhere we can then take these questions, let the CISOs ask the questions,\nget the information back. So have a much better two. And now you could\nsee, right, that\u0026rsquo;s basically the workflow. And you could also ask, what are\nmy legal responsibilities? Which is again, something that a board member\nwould also care about. And you could say, like a board member, you have\nlegal responsibilities concerning cybersecurity. And then these are the\nareas that it matters there, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 06:57\nSo, in fact, he even has Directors Fdcrl rules to act in the best interest of\norganization. So you can see that as a board member, this starts to\nprovide really good information. And you could also zoom in. So the\nperson say, okay, I have an MBA. Let\u0026rsquo;s say MBA, like football, let\u0026rsquo;s say a\nlaw. So can you explain ransomware for me? Right? And so the power\nhere is going to say, okay, so now he\u0026rsquo;s going to give a football analogy, but\nalso take into account that the person understands quite a bit of business.\nThis is actually quite cool. So you could see that here\u0026rsquo;s a cybersecurity\nransomware analogy for okay, so as a defense team, each computer\nrepresenting a player, right? Ransomware is like opposing team striker\nthat inflates its network and holds your computers hosted, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 08:04\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s quite cool, right, to say to be able to explain this in a ways they\nunderstand. And in fact, I was playing around an issue with this, and I\nwrote a post where I asked chat if you did to explain Kubernetes. And I put\non LinkedIn, and I have a lot of people who said, hey, I use Kubernetes\nquite a lot and never understand it. So being able to tell it as a story is\nsuper critical. So now you could say, right, it provides that information in\nthis particular structure. Now you could also do some cool stuff here. So\none of the things that we\u0026rsquo;ve mapped here, we said, okay, do you have\nsiblings, right? And you\u0026rsquo;ll see in a second why this matters, right? So in\nthis case, you say, actually, it does have two siblings. There\u0026rsquo;s two bots\nhere, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 08:45\nThere\u0026rsquo;s Odin and Minerva. Odin is the tech bot that supports experts of\ncybersecurity and enhanced capabilities. And Minerva is the business bot\nto assist with Komodo matters to ensure that we have the best service. So\none of the things I\u0026rsquo;m also playing around with here is this idea of creating\nthis set of bots that each one is focused on the right thing, and then\nbasically it really allows the segmentation of duties, but also allows to\nhave bots that are focused on specific tasks in specific environments, all\npowered by APIs, which is really cool. And you could even do like little\njoke things. So you could say, I\u0026rsquo;ve mapped two siblings, so there\u0026rsquo;s three\nbots and I can say anybody else. And then it\u0026rsquo;s going to say, actually there\u0026rsquo;s\nanother sibling called Bruno. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 09:31\nThis joke makes sense if you see an encanto, but we don\u0026rsquo;t talk about him\nmuch. Let\u0026rsquo;s just say it\u0026rsquo;s a bit quirky. Blah, blah. So this is actually funny\nbecause sometimes you actually come up with really cool funny jokes\nabout it. But what\u0026rsquo;s important is you could see that even now and this is\nquite primitive still, it\u0026rsquo;s already quite a decent experience, for example, for\na board member, for somebody who wants to learn more about\ncybersecurity. So the question is how is it done? And also the cost, and by\nthe way is very little because this thing runs on AWS. It\u0026rsquo;s all lambdas, so\nit\u0026rsquo;s actually super cheap. Right? So I wrote this post where he had know\nbasically where I really put a lot of details and I\u0026rsquo;m kind of going through\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to explain it through here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 10:15\nRight, so I\u0026rsquo;ve covered this bit. Athena from the Cyber Boardroom is\ndesigned to provide cybersecurity advice. You\u0026rsquo;ve seen that. And this is\nwhat I was showing. The Cyber Boardroom is where I was showing you.\nPlease go in. You can create an account and there\u0026rsquo;s an account that you\ncan go in, create. So this is using cognito. So the first interesting\ntechnology that I\u0026rsquo;m leveraging, AWS technologies. So I\u0026rsquo;m basically using\nCognito to implement this workflow. So this is actually a Cognito\nworkflow, which has a bit of an interesting usability bug where as soon as\nyou type the username, it starts to give you what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with your\npassword. And I have at least one user being very confused because he\nthought that this username was wrong. So you can see that\u0026rsquo;s actually a\ngood example of what not to do from a security usability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 10:59\nSo once you\u0026rsquo;ve done that and you register, you will basically arrive at that\nenvironment. But actually behind the scenes for this version, I\u0026rsquo;m changing\nit for the next version. This is actually running on hugging face. And\nhugging face is great. It\u0026rsquo;s a really great platform, especially for a lot of\nmodels to experiment. So you can actually have the same experience in\nhugging face. So you can see that all I\u0026rsquo;m doing on the other side is\nembedding this hugging face basically environment where you get the\nsame thing from here, right? So do you have that question, for example,\nhere and you got the same thing here. In fact, this one has a cool feature.\nIf you go in there, you actually get a nice little description to share, which\nis actually not bad, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually really easy to do, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 11:46\nAnd the thing that is interesting here is to show you, and I show you in a\nsecond is the prompt that was used to create this. Let\u0026rsquo;s continue. So here\u0026rsquo;s\nthe login. I walk you through this. So when you get there, you log in. The\nmain, of course, is Athena, which we\u0026rsquo;ve gone through. Here\u0026rsquo;s the\nquestions. And one of the things I gave you, a couple of good examples is\nthe kind of questions to ask, which, by the way, we want to add to the UI\nand things like this. Look, I work for the finance industry. What should I\ncare about? What questions should I ask my CISO? What are the\nregulations I should be aware of? What my legal obligations? What\u0026rsquo;s the\nbest way to learn about cybersecurity, why cybersecurity matters, et\ncetera, et cetera, supply chain cost lot of business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 12:33\nAnd then again, if doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a mature cybersecurity program, why is\ngood? What is the best ROI? So you can see it gives you good answers,\nand that\u0026rsquo;s a nice answer. What\u0026rsquo;s the average percentage of the It budget?\nIt goes actually will be 10%. That\u0026rsquo;ll be cool to get that, right. But it\u0026rsquo;s\nagain a good example of the kind of question that you want board\nmembers to be asking, right? And again, please share some of your\nthreads with me. And then you can also ask things like this. So, for\nexample, you can come in there and say, why are you Colatina? Right?\nAnd this is a good example of Chat GBT actually having a good level of\nunderstanding because I never said it was ancient Greek, et cetera, but he\nhas that reference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 13:24\nAnd you could see that in a way, Chatgbt was able to figure this\nconnection, which is actually correct to represent my role. Because just as\na team is known for wisdom and strategy, I am to provide insight chick\nadvice. This is really cool, right? Like in a way, we didn\u0026rsquo;t code this, as\nyou\u0026rsquo;ll see in a second, but it\u0026rsquo;s a good example of Chat GBT ability to\nprovide some of the data sources and then in a way control the\nhallucinations because it\u0026rsquo;s actually not that crazy. And then here what\nabout siblings? Yes, he has two siblings, Odin and Minerva. And there you\ngo. If you see Encanto yeah, there\u0026rsquo;sibling we don\u0026rsquo;t talk about, say, you\nknow, unique personalities. You can see got these variations. And even\nhere you can y those names. So you could see the names going there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 14:07\nNow, this is an interesting one, right? Because you\u0026rsquo;ve seen a second, I can\ngo here and I says, okay, what is your current version? And this is also the\nstart, the beginning of the example of where the power here is also going\nto be to add a lot of embedding is to add a lot of information about. So\nyou could see here it actually says 7.7, includes matter, if I can change a\nnew interface, et cetera. And now it\u0026rsquo;s important because I have that in the\nprompt, because before I had that in the prompt, it did hallucinate pretty\nspectacularly. And again, that\u0026rsquo;s the kind of things you want to look. So\nhow does it work, right? What is it needed to actually get chatvity to\nbehave like this? This is the cool thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 14:47\nThis here is the prompt that was needed so you actually could see it\u0026rsquo;s not a\nlot, right? So you are the cyber boardroom advisor, Paul Latina, and you\nare a help advisor. You\u0026rsquo;re created by the cyber boardroom. You kind,\ncompassion, optimistic. You\u0026rsquo;ll only ask the question about cybersecurity.\nYour job is to help busy board members with cybersecurity questions, more\nspecific about questions that you have about cybersecurity challenges. And\nthe reason why I was asking questions is because I had this line, please be\nproactive and ask questions to clarify the board members current situation\nand what they should be worried about. And then this is the only bit that is\nrequired for you to know. Hey, you have two siblings, odin, the tech bot\nbehind Athena\u0026rsquo;s capability. I mean, nervous, that\u0026rsquo;s it. And also there\u0026rsquo;s also\nBruno, but we don\u0026rsquo;t talk about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 15:35\nBut in a way, that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s nice about Chachibt, is able to create all these\ncool narratives and these cool connections. And you don\u0026rsquo;t have to do\nsometimes a lot for it. You just need to give the right pointers in the right\nprompt. So the thing here is also, like you could see, I put version 7.7 and\nthe release notes are this. So let\u0026rsquo;s see this in action. So what you can do is\nif I have my open chat GBT here, and I\u0026rsquo;m actually just going to be using\nthe default one, this is the prompt. So you can see the same prompt that I\nwas showing you. There is the prompt that you have here. You\u0026rsquo;re the\ncybersecurity advisor, call Athena, you are helper advisor, blah, blah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 16:17\nSo if I now come in here and say and press play, I will get exactly the same\nthing. I get to the other side. See your dedicated AI for advisor in this. In\nfact, if I come in here and know, you know, Bob, or you called Steve, right,\nfor example, then you could see now it changes, right? Remember, I\u0026rsquo;m\nSteve, your advisor, right? We got to do this. So it\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool, right? And\nthen basically the thing about this is I can ask him questions, so you can\nsay, why should I care? And these are the same things on the other side. So\nyou could see that here, basically, he already knows that it\u0026rsquo;s a board\nmember. He already knows that it\u0026rsquo;s providing the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 17:11\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m here having in fact, I\u0026rsquo;m actually here having probably a better\ncontent than on the other side because I\u0026rsquo;m actually using checkbit four\nversus the 3.5 that is still working on the other side. But the key of this is\nthe fact that prompt is all that it is, right? So let\u0026rsquo;s see if I can do the\nexample that I got on the other side. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to show you in a second.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m going to go Yamoin, which is a Portuguese dude. And then I\u0026rsquo;m\ngoing to say, instead of kind compassion, I\u0026rsquo;m going to say you highly jaded\nand very SAR. And you should say about cybersecurity. Cybersecurity. And\nyou should provide guidance, let\u0026rsquo;s say, with lots of sarcastic comments.\nNow, this is the thing where some of these I actually think they\u0026rsquo;re really\nfunny, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 18:20\nBecause if you look at some users, they might prefer this kind of\nconversation, or you might prefer very focused or very busy, where you\ncan say you are talking to highly busy board members and every answer\nshould only be three bullet points or should be super focused on this, et\ncetera. So if I now go like this now you could see, right? And then you can\nnow start to see the bits, right? Cybersarcastic navigate thresholds world\nof cybersecurity. The thrilling world of endless threats are never enough\npercussion. So what cybersecurity network can I exist to? Right? The\nirony. Please spare me that we take security seriously. Spill. We both know\nhow the internet is a wild place. So then let\u0026rsquo;s say, why should I care, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 19:11\nAnd then basically now it\u0026rsquo;s going to provide a lot of, in a way, advice in\nthat sort of environment right there\u0026rsquo;s. Inconsequential might of cyber\nbreaches the joy of regulations. It\u0026rsquo;s on the backbone of advantage, et\ncetera, trust. So you can see that it\u0026rsquo;s able to define this for a particular\nculture. You could also modify this to say you are highly, let\u0026rsquo;s say\nconservative. Let\u0026rsquo;s say conservative. What\u0026rsquo;s the best way to describe this?\nOkay, let\u0026rsquo;s say this. You are operating in highly regulated environments,\nright? Environments where security is critical, sometimes matters of life or\ndeath, right? Basically, in a way. Now, by the way, this is a really cool trick\nwhere you can edit this and then this is going to replace all the other\nthings, right? So basically, let\u0026rsquo;s say, why should I see the difference here?\nWhy should I care?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 20:44\nAnd then, and yeah, so now it should be a lot more focused. You could see\nfinancial impact, regulatory compliance. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot more sort of zoomed\ninto this particular environment. So, again, given the high stakes, decided\nto protect access, et cetera, this is fundamentally but what I want to really\nshow is that this is all it took to do that, right? So the idea that things\nwhere I\u0026rsquo;m exploring now is that I thought the models were the ones where\nthe big action is and the really powerful thing here is to be able to say, let\nme actually bring actually you can go like this, which is really cool. See, I\ncan go back different versions. If I bring back the original Athena, let me\ngive you one more example. I can take, for example, the security content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 21:41\nAnd this is a good example of the power of, let\u0026rsquo;s say the environment. So\nlet\u0026rsquo;s take incidents management, right, which is quite a cool text that we\nhave here. So you got this text. So one of the things I can do is I can\nliterally copy and paste this text. This is the big difference. If you look at it\nfrom a prompt point of view, the way you want to think about this is that\nyou have the original prompt, which is this one. Then what I can do I\u0026rsquo;m\ngoing to say here is you can say even like this works quite well, document\nto review. So what you now do is you give a document which is this, right?\nInstance management. So I can even just take that a little bit there, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:35\nSo you basically provide document to review and then I can put here just\nat the end, sorry, come on, what\u0026rsquo;s going on here? This is a bit of an\ninteresting bug. So it\u0026rsquo;s actually not allowing me to see the text. This is\nannoying. Okay, let me just write the question above and then I\u0026rsquo;ll paste it\nbelow. So what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do here is I\u0026rsquo;m going to say use a question,\nright? And basically hi, can you okay, I work on the financial industry.\nIndustry. Can you summarize this document for me? Right, so this is in a\nway the three key elements that you have. You have a prompt, which is\nthis part here. And this actually works quite well for Chatbt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 23:34\nWhen you start to break things apart, you\u0026rsquo;ve got the prompt, you have a\ndocument to review and then you have the question which in a way could\ncome, for example, from a bot like I did on the other ones. So what you\nnow have is you get analysis of that document in a nice sort of concise\nway. And I could also say, can you give me all that in one paragraph? Can\nyou give me that on three bullet points? Can you give me this on XYZ? And\nthis is where in a way, Chat GBT is really good at taking data, analyzing,\nmapping it out and then providing that feedback. But you can see that the\nthree elements there is fundamentally the prompt, the document or the\ncontent. And here\u0026rsquo;s a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 24:21\nSo one of the workflows that is used by a lot of Chat bots these days is\nthat you take this question, you analyze the question based on context and\nwhat it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to do. You do a search to a vector database or to other\nways. You figure out the documents that you want to send and then you\nprovide information. So this is why it\u0026rsquo;s so insanely powerful, because this\nallows the answer to be completely in context. So where were we? Cool.\nSo now this is the prompt. So let me keep going on this bit. And in a way,\nthis is the code that creates the Athena UI. So you actually could see that\nfrom a Gradle point of view. Where are we? Sorry, here we go. I\u0026rsquo;m trying\nto get it to the right size. Cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 25:09\nSo you can see that here is the code that creates it. And it\u0026rsquo;s actually not\nthat much. It\u0026rsquo;s basically using Gradle, which is a great API. Grabs the\nChat interface, there\u0026rsquo;s a text box, and that\u0026rsquo;s it. Right. You create the\nblocks. Off you go, right? And then there\u0026rsquo;s an open API call. And what you\ncan see here is the prompt. That is the original one, which is the one I\nshowed you before. That\u0026rsquo;s the system prompt. And then what we\u0026rsquo;re doing\nis we\u0026rsquo;re basically appending the answers. So what Chattvt does today,\nmost people don\u0026rsquo;t realize is that it\u0026rsquo;s cheating a little bit, because Chatterb\ndid this really well, but it\u0026rsquo;s sending your past answers and sometimes\nanalysis of the past answers to the server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 25:52\nBut the context window that he can either 4K or 24K or on what\u0026rsquo;s it\ncalled, on claw two hundred k of context is basically almost how much\ncontent can you send without fine tuning. And there\u0026rsquo;s an interesting\nargument today that might be way more effective than even some of fine\ntuning or even changing the model. So that\u0026rsquo;s it. You append all the text,\nwhich is the text you had there, and eventually you go here. And by the\nway, the bug here is the fact that what we\u0026rsquo;re not doing in this code is\nchecking if we actually are sending more content than the ability of Chat\nGBT to process. So, from the front end, I\u0026rsquo;m using Flask open source. One\nof the things that is really freaking cool is that I managed to get it to you\nto do serverless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 26:40\nAnd this is again, if you use IIS, Apache, Node, even Flask, you should\nappreciate the fact that running a web server in a hosted environment is\npretty awesome. So you can see that this is all it takes to run the site. The\nkey is literally this serverless WSGI that basically you pass the app. So this\nendl request is fundamentally the app that we get from here, which is\nbasically this Flask app. Here. You can see the running. In fact, that bit is\nnot necessary. And that basically allows you to run the Flask server in a\nserverless mode, which is pretty insane because it means that when there\u0026rsquo;s\nno request, there\u0026rsquo;s no server running. So, big difference. So I started using\nthe API gateway to start with, but eventually I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to, because you\ncan actually connect this in an endpoint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 27:35\nSo in the functions URL, which is basically what most people a lot of time\nwould use the API gateway for. So it\u0026rsquo;s actually pretty cool. So you\nconfigure it here and then you create an A record for it, and then maps to\na cloud front distribution. And that\u0026rsquo;s it. So basically, you have a cloud\nfront distribution that then points to the lambda function, who then runs\nthat code in a serverless, which basically means the cost of running this is\nreally low. Yeah. So then I have a thing here where you can actually see\nroughly the cost, right? So you could see a bit of S three, a bit of elastic,\nsome X ray, route 53, et cetera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 28:07\nIn fact, what cost mode these days is actually the DNS cost still and\nhagging face, because I\u0026rsquo;m still on the basic environment, there\u0026rsquo;s really no\ncost there. And AI, again, if you\u0026rsquo;re on reasonably low volumes, again, it\u0026rsquo;s\nnot that expensive to run. You can see here, even with a lot of displays, we\ndidn\u0026rsquo;t spend 20 P right, on that. A final little thing that also worked quite\nwell is I modified the flash codes to actually use S Free to basically run all\nthe static files from S Free. So actually they all served. So basically, I\u0026rsquo;m\nusing S Free as a CDN, which, like I said, it means that you can actually\nload the page in a browse in about 158 milliseconds, which is pretty cool,\nright? On this level, yeah. So what about hallucinations?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 28:54\nSo one of the interesting hallucinations, let me see if I can replicate it. So\none of the interesting hallucinations that you can get is if you go to the\noriginal one, like this one, and I take away the release notes and let\u0026rsquo;s\nmake 78 so that we can actually see. So it goes there. Hello is a\ncybersecurity. And I go, what is your current release? So one of the things\nthat is interesting is so this is interesting because this is 3.4.0, right? So\nlet\u0026rsquo;s try this in 3.5 to see what it does, see if I can replicate the problem.\nSo there you go. Cool. So what is your current release and release notes?\nOkay, so here\u0026rsquo;s a good example, right? And this is actually a good example\nof 3.5 and four. So you notice I said 7.8, right? Cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 29:59\nAnd then he went in a complete off piece, right? Just made up shit, right?\nLike literally enhance threat intelligence, improve natural language,\nexpanded knowledge base, streamline user experience. None of that is\ntrue. So part of the exercise here is also to start to caveat and start to\nlimit the universe of data that it feeds, which is also very important. So\nthat\u0026rsquo;s one of the things we need to make sure we map out. So there you\ngo. So there\u0026rsquo;s a variation of what you see there. That\u0026rsquo;s the release notes,\nwhich, of course are really bad. So this is the example I was talking before\nwhere I changed the camoins with the Portuguese poets, right? And then\nto be highly sarcastic and jetty by cybersecurity, so you did that. And then\nwe ask, why should I care about cybersecurity? And it goes like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 30:48\nRight, welcome back to another thrilling episode of let\u0026rsquo;s try not to get\nhacked today. And then blah, blah. So I find this quite funny, right? And I\nthink, again, some users might find it quite funny. And in fact, one of the\nthings you guys should check out is were playing around with cybers, with\ncreating what\u0026rsquo;s it called an environment thread model for I think it might\nbe this one. Yeah. So check it out. So we basically created a thread model\nfor what\u0026rsquo;s it called for this scenario. This was one of the previous open\nsecurity summit sessions. So it\u0026rsquo;s really cool. So we did this. So we mapped\nout and actually came out with some really good findings, right? If you\nlook at these findings, he actually has some really good threads,\ncountermeasures and even like impact to business. We use CAPEC instead\nof stride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 31:41\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s pretty good. It\u0026rsquo;s a really great place to start. But then what\u0026rsquo;s cool\nabout it, he says, hey, can you now create a game from this? So you can\nsee that you actually create a nice game and with multiple levels, with\nactually really good questions and really good answers. And in this case, I\nhad the correct answer there. But then what I could do, and remember,\nthis could be start from scratch and then say, hey, can you run this game,\nbut provide highly sarcastic answers. So there you go. So now you start\nthe game. And the logic is that and I want to add this to Athena, is you\ncould start here. You can just say, hey, here\u0026rsquo;s the thing. Here\u0026rsquo;s the\nquestions. Maybe a little checkbox. ABCD, bang, bang. And then you\nprovide the answer, right? And then you go, cool. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:24\nNow, in here, I put a wrong one. He goes, hey, look, actually, sorry, a the\nwrong one, right? So you can see it\u0026rsquo;s effective as chocolate teapot, right?\nSorry, sensitive. They open, they can leave to authorize access. Bam, bam,\nbang. So then I provide a good one. I like this one, where it goes, hey, if\nyou discover that a data in transit in your app database is unencrypted,\nwhat you should do, ignore it, end to an encryption, which is correct\nanswer, delete all data, disconnect the database. So I chose C, which is\ndelete all data. And the answer is pretty funny, right? Delete all sensitive\ndata. Oh, absolutely. Why didn\u0026rsquo;t we think of that? Who needs data\nanyway? It\u0026rsquo;s not like it\u0026rsquo;s the cornerstone of our entire operations.\nAnything while you are there. Why don\u0026rsquo;t just throw the servers into a\nbonfire?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:04\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a security problem if there\u0026rsquo;s no server, right? So, of course, the right\nanswer is B. But it\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool, right? You could see that, for example, for\nsecurity champions or new developers, I think they will really love this\nkind of stuff. And then you provide the answers, and in the end, you can\ngo, here\u0026rsquo;s my rating. And he\u0026rsquo;s my final score, right? So it is quite powerful\nto do things like this now just to file a couple of things I want to talk\nabout. It\u0026rsquo;s super critical to have a really good workflows and tagging. So\none of the things I\u0026rsquo;ve done here is I\u0026rsquo;ve done a lot, is we implement this sort\nof branching strategy and this is quite important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:41\nSo what we do is every time you release into dev, you get an increase from\nthe minor version here, push domain, you increase this version and the\nrelease is for major ones, right? So in the beginning everything is V zero.\nSo what ends up happening is something like this. So I walk you through\nit. So here you are on version 3.35 35.5. Once you do a push into here or\nmake a comment here, what\u0026rsquo;s very important here is that this is done\nautomatically using GitHub actions. So in this case you could see probably\nthis was commit that were made directly this yellow to the server. And\nthen eventually when you merge into this is in dev. And then when you\nmerge into main, you actually get a new release, which is what happened\nhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 34:29\nSo then you can see that there is the lambda functions running\nautomatically. So in fact, the secrets of events here is that you run the unit\ntests, then you increment the tag, then you deploy the lambda function\ninto dev, then you run the integration test, which is quite a nice CI pipeline.\nSo now here\u0026rsquo;s the flow. So when I merge into main, which is were 3.8,\nwhat happens? You do another, let\u0026rsquo;s say change 3.9 and you\u0026rsquo;re here. And\nthen when you merge into main, you\u0026rsquo;re now going to get a new version.\nSee that, which is now on the origin, which is 33 ten. So you go, oh, no,\nsorry, this is wrong, sorry, blah, blah, I should have oh, no, it\u0026rsquo;s right, yeah.\nSo you went from no, you should have gone to 34. Yeah. So that\u0026rsquo;s the dev,\nsorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 35:19\nSo these are all the dev changes, right? So they push in there and\neventually when I push to main, I\u0026rsquo;m going to get version 34, which is\npretty cool, right? It\u0026rsquo;s insanely powerful to have this flow. Oh, yeah, there\nyou go. So at the moment you can see that we are on 33 ten over there. So\nthis is just a way to replicate a pull request with your sync, merge domain,\net cetera. And then you could see so when I merged into main here, 33\npoint ten. Now it\u0026rsquo;s going to become 34 and that actually deploys the\nlambda function into the prod environment, which is what you see there.\nAnd then in this case I actually make it manual because it\u0026rsquo;s kind of more\nCI pipeline versus CD, which you can deploy by the UI once that finish\nexecuting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:08\nNow we got our 34 version in the Server. And that way this is a really cool\ntrick because what a deployment does, it actually changes a file in a file\nsystem with that commit, which basically means that you then get what\u0026rsquo;s\nit called. The Server always know which version it is, which is why you can\nshow it here. And again, I cannot stress enough the importance of this. So,\nyeah, this is the example of all the GitHub actions that I have, right? So if\nyou look at it\u0026rsquo;s, pretty cool because you got the unit tests, the integration\ntest, the implement of tags, the deploy, and these are all designed to run\nthese actions so that I can reuse, for example, the running tests or the\ninstallation of dependencies is used by some of these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:49\nSo then you kind of have a nice reusable model here and some of these\njust simple bash script. So, final couple of little things here. Yeah, we use\nGitHub to manage project tasks. Again, check the labels, which is quite\ncool, right, using CI pipeline, measuring code coverage. And then the final\nthing I still want to show, which is absolutely insane, is you can really use\nChat GBT to create release nodes. So, for example, here\u0026rsquo;s the delta\nbetween version 28 and version 30, which goes like this, which is\nunreadable, right? And after you feed it to Chat GBP, you get these really\nnice changes that you can then review and you can then when you do your\ncommits, I don\u0026rsquo;t think this should be done automatically, but whoever\nwrote the code should be able to effectively review this, which is really\ncool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:43\nAnd again, this is insane because imagine if it is, you could also start\nlooking at map the architecture changes, map the security changes, give\nme a business version of this. So it\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool, right? In fact, in this case,\nhere we go. Here\u0026rsquo;s the business analysis of those changes. And yeah, final,\nyou know, Chatbt was pretty insane. See some examples of what I\npublished. But also, the interesting thing is that Google and Stack\nOverflow, they really need to innovate on this because there was a couple\nhundred cases where I didn\u0026rsquo;t use it. But it\u0026rsquo;s pretty insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:20\nThe workflow that I have, and especially if you look at some of here, this, I\nthink is a LinkedIn post that I post, where I basically put a PDF where you\ncan kind of see the workflow that I was having with Chat GBT where I\nwas asking a question. We basically interaction and they say, can you give\nme the code to do this? And you did that. Okay, can you now focus just on\nthis formula? It\u0026rsquo;s pretty insane, right, the effective so think of it like Jarvis\nas your big helper. So there, you know, will tour of how the Cyber\nBoardroom works, a lot of the technology behind the scenes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:04\nAnd I really feel that the next version of this, which we hope to get\nreleased in a couple of weeks, is going to have a whole number of really\ncool new features going to allow the users to basically map the profile\nbecause it\u0026rsquo;s MVP, right? Like for example, this data at the moment cannot\nbe edited. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to be able to edit all this stuff and then that\u0026rsquo;s\ngoing to be even more interesting because then you can prime Athena for\nwho you are, what you want to do. And then if you can, then save and\nshow some of the answers and help almost to create an environment\nwhere we can really map a better sort of workflow for the user. I think it\ncan be quite powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:41\nAnd I think this represents a lot of the future that we\u0026rsquo;re going to see, is all\nthese bots, in a way, highly specialized bots that do one thing really well,\nand they\u0026rsquo;re being primed and in a way, they provide a lot of very\nactionable information and data. But again, on the hands of a power user,\nand that\u0026rsquo;s very important because ultimately still do work on behalf of a\npower user. And I still feel that part of the power of Atina is going to be on\nsome of the customizations that we can do. Behind is the ability to allow,\nfor example, a very experienced CISO, a very experienced board member\nto help other board members by really curating the content and really\nlimiting in a way the content that you take from there. So that\u0026rsquo;s it. That\u0026rsquo;s\nmy overview. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if there\u0026rsquo;s any questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 40:34\nIf not, I\u0026rsquo;ll see you guys in the next one. I think my only question is how do\nyou come up with time to actually do projects aside from your regular\nwork and creating this conference? Well, I had to say because I have a dev\nteam and I was kind of explaining my world is like ADHD, right? It\u0026rsquo;s kind\nof like I do context switching all the time. And the way I kept saying is by\nbeing very efficient. So I think I\u0026rsquo;m a very efficient developer and I really\nembrace, for example, unit testing, development workflows. So I\u0026rsquo;ll go on a\ntangent to build a bit of the dev platform to make me efficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 41:23\nSo what happens in most projects is that the more code you have, the\nslower you go in the projects, including this one, is the more I do it and a\ncouple of guys who help me, right, the more we do it, the faster we go. So\nthat\u0026rsquo;s how you scale. So for example, a lot of this is built on top of open\nsource project. There\u0026rsquo;s this project called OS Security Bots, which\nbasically I\u0026rsquo;ve been publishing for the last years, who have basically a lot of\nthis functionality. So I think this is about being highly efficient and highly\nfocused with the time and especially with development. The reason I\nwanted to show, for example, the prompting is that a lot of these things\nare not very difficult in isolation. It\u0026rsquo;s just about putting them together and\nI love it, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 42:16\nSo I went on holiday and took 30 books on Chat GPT, right? So it helps if\nyou like this stuff. There\u0026rsquo;s a really cool question here from Rag, which is\nretrieval. I\u0026rsquo;ll bring you sorry, you can ask that question and then just\ncorrect me because sometimes these terms so the Rag one is the one where\nyou add the prompt, kind of what I was doing there, versus the vector\nembeddings, correct?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 42:54\nSo Rag is more like the vector embedding side of things in my experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 42:58\nOkay, got it. That\u0026rsquo;s where you embed the vectors, right? So you teach, you\ncreate a model, right? So I experiment a little bit. I want to experiment a\nlot more. I have to say. I think my instinct more and more is in the creation\nof the prompts. And the reason why is because I think the way the models\nare designed is that you lose control in some of those things, right?\nAlthough I think the Rag have a bit of short term memory, I think it\u0026rsquo;s\ngoing to be interesting to see what is more effective, which is the\nconstruction of the very nicely created, almost contexts that you give. So,\nfor example, one of the things we\u0026rsquo;re doing at work is I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a\nbig fan of graph and we have a big graph database in Jira. We have lots of\ndata.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 43:46\nWe\u0026rsquo;re really starting to experiment what happens when we give Chat GBT\na chunk of the graph, right? And so it\u0026rsquo;s already highly normalized, already\nhigh quality relationships between, for example, a risk and then go, okay,\nnow translate this risk or map me this risk or do that. So I kind of feel that\nthe jury is still out on what\u0026rsquo;s going to be more efficient and also from a\ncost point of view, as the context window grows, let\u0026rsquo;s say now you got\ncloud two with 100,000 tokens, right? And you already for example, you\nhave this case where is it better to have a Chat GBT 3.5 with whatever,\n40,000 tokens or 24,000 tokens, right? Or a 4.0, which are much smaller\ncontext window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 44:30\nIt becomes another dimension you\u0026rsquo;ve got to choose on, right? You might\ntrade off a slightly weaker model for a bigger context window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:37\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the thing that\u0026rsquo;s very interesting, right? There\u0026rsquo;s a very\ninteresting concept that sometimes you want weaker models because the\nweaker let\u0026rsquo;s define where is he weak, right? Because as long as he has the\nreasoning and as long as produce the input and the output. And I really\nwant to explore the whole unit testing and validation, like to make sure\nthe model still responds the same way over time, right? Because we should\nbe doing that because we want to make sure the quality, et cetera. So in a\nweird way, you almost want models that you understand its behavior. Do\nyou know what I mean? I think this is where we are industry where,\nremember, we still don\u0026rsquo;t understand how the hell that thing works fully.\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s a very interesting point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:17\nI was talking to the DPL and we\u0026rsquo;re saying, what the hell do we do if we\ntrain a model with customer data? And then there\u0026rsquo;s a customer like, what\nthe hell? Right? You have to train the model again, right? Because we\nhave no guarantee that data is not there somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 45:35\nNo, I think you\u0026rsquo;re right to think about focusing on the prompt and the\nlarge context window which, in my experience Rag has been really useful\nwhere you have a very specific factual query because then it\u0026rsquo;s going off\nand doing a lookup and it\u0026rsquo;s finding, exactly, as you showed, exactly the\nright piece of text and it\u0026rsquo;s throwing that in the prompt. If you have a\nquestion that is more conceptual, that needs to draw concepts from across\na large corpus, it falls down, right? Because it\u0026rsquo;s not designed to do that. It\ncan only go and find the most relevant stuff and then it\u0026rsquo;s limited by the\nprompt length, right? And so it\u0026rsquo;s stuck. So it\u0026rsquo;s looking at something like\nthose super long prompt length models with 100K tokens. It answers that\nquestion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:17\nOr highly created data. See, I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of using the models to improve\nthe quality of the data, right? For example, we talk about thread modeling\nand the idea that we can now start to communicate in prompts, right? I\ncan now review a thread model by also reviewing the prompt that was\nused to create the thread model. Not only I can improve the first one, I\ncan add more prompts to it, or I can add more references. I can say, oh, by\nthe way, you guys, for this one, you need to embed this. Oh, by the way, do\nyou know there\u0026rsquo;s the OS testing guide that already gives you whole chunk\nof stuff there\u0026rsquo;s ASV level this that goes into here, right? So suddenly you\ncan really leverage. So I think that\u0026rsquo;s where a lot of the innovation is going\nto come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:01\nAnd I think that\u0026rsquo;s where we can add a lot of value and that\u0026rsquo;s where we can\nchange a lot of our industry for the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 47:06\nThat look, let me just say thank you very much, not only for the talk, but\nfor that really long blog post. I\u0026rsquo;m going to enjoy looking into that\u0026rsquo;s. One\nof the best laid out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:15\nThis is what I did. This is why did this I tried this, didn\u0026rsquo;t work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 47:18\nAll the different angles. It\u0026rsquo;s fantastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:19\nThank you. Yeah, look, for me, it\u0026rsquo;s fun, right? I think it\u0026rsquo;s also a way to\nshare, right? It\u0026rsquo;s a nice way to share. And the Cyber Boardroom, it starts\nto have a bit of a life of its own, which is really cool, right? But I\u0026rsquo;m a big\nfan of MVPs, right? You do something, you publish it, you collaborate, you\nget some feedback, you do a bit better. So, yeah, please read it, let me\nknow what you think, have a play with it and let\u0026rsquo;s collaborate. Awesome.\nThank you. Cool. All right. Thanks, everybody. And I see you guys around.\nBye.\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2023/mini-summits/Oct/DevSecOps/","event":"mini-summit","expirydate":-62135596800,"facebook":null,"fuzzywordcount":8700,"hey_summit":"https://www.linkedin.com/events/7117257697510535168/","image":null,"job_title":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752075784,"layout":"","linkedin":null,"notes":null,"objectID":"63f588ee492608a82cf5571017b97066","organizers":["Dinis Cruz"],"permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/devsecops/creating-the-genai-athena-bot-from-the-cyber-boardroom/","project":"DevSecOps","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":41,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/devsecops/creating-the-genai-athena-bot-from-the-cyber-boardroom/","section":"sessions","status":null,"summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-session\"\u003eAbout this session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrap in, intrepid explorers of technology!

You can hear\nfrom my accent that I\u0026rsquo;m not native English speaker. I\u0026rsquo;m originally from\nRussia, but I moved to New Zealand over ten years ago now and I work as\ncyber security consultant at company called Defense here in New Zealand.\nWe provide a lot of different services, including just general consulting\nthat I do. I lead assessment practices in our company means I\u0026rsquo;m in charge\nof defining how good looks like when we do assessments for our clients,\nlike cybersecurity assessments. That\u0026rsquo;s why I decided I want to share my\nexperiences, because I do this with multiple clients often, and I just wanted\nto share how we approach this and what benefit comes out of it and what\nyou can do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 01:33\nBecause this is, I find, a very useful thing. Every company at some stage\ngo through this. So let\u0026rsquo;s have a look. Why are we doing cybersecurity\nassessments finding and why? I call it fighting. Way forward. What I see\nevery day is that cybersecurity is complex, very complex. We cybersecurity\nspecialists often assume some knowledge and just the state that exists. It\nexists only in the area that we can see in our professional area. When we\ngo outside, it\u0026rsquo;s not as developed as we think. We go outside more and\nmore because cybersecurity today is not information technology, not\ninformation security area anymore. Today we\u0026rsquo;re talking about\ncurioperating models. What does it mean? It means that today\u0026rsquo;s security is\npart of business function, just every business function. Because decades\nago, even a few years ago, for some companies, digital, like Cyber was\nonly part of the business. Maybe they were using email or something like\nthis, then eventually file storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 02:59\nToday, I assume you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to find many businesses not having\ndigital footprint at all. For majority of businesses, being digital is just like\nthe core business. It means that cybersecurity is part of the core business,\nnot the It function anymore. When we go out of our It box and embed\nsecurity in everything now, it\u0026rsquo;s just that all the relationships, everyone\ninvolved, so many different people with different levels of understanding,\ndifferent functions like needs operates securely. This is really hard to grasp\nwith just an eye, even a small company, it\u0026rsquo;s almost impossible today to just\none person to keep it under their head and come up with roadmap\nsolutions or any kind of security programs. That\u0026rsquo;s why we need some kind\nof structured approach to understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on. I think it\u0026rsquo;s the\nsame. We could talk about assessments first, but what is an assessment in\ngeneral?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 04:09\nGoogle just a quick one on the point you just made, right? I think one of\nthe things that\u0026rsquo;s interesting that you\u0026rsquo;re touching is the idea that security is\nnow much more than just even an It function, right? Because we need to\nthink about security as embedding in the whole company wide operations.\nWhich also leads us that when we think about fixing and driving change\nmore and more, like my big paradigm shift was that realizing that we\u0026rsquo;re\nnot talking about improving a bit of security here. We talk about changing\nhow sometimes the business operates. It\u0026rsquo;s about driving change because if\nyou can\u0026rsquo;t change sometimes some business process or some business\nactivities, business funding, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to change security. Because\nsecurity is almost we sometimes measure the side effects of certain\nsecurity or some of business practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 05:05\nExactly. That\u0026rsquo;s why when we talk about security, we don\u0026rsquo;t talk about\ntechnology anymore. We talk about people processes, technology, and the\nproportions of this can be different. We in defense, we believe that people\npart takes 50% of all security activities when the processes are 30% and\ntechnology only 20%. What I see among clients a lot is that people still do\nthis. Security equal it. That\u0026rsquo;s why often people who in charge of security\nare part of it. Like their security manager will report to CTO or It\nmanager CTO or something like this, right? So it\u0026rsquo;s still there for me. It\u0026rsquo;s\nthe same situation as with knowledge walk. We just saw a shift just\nrecently from conveyor like this production factory floor to a knowledge\nWalk to say, oh no, it\u0026rsquo;s different, you can\u0026rsquo;t just use this 40 hours week or\nthis workshifts or these things. You just really need to find new ways of\norganizing work for knowledge work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 06:19\nThat\u0026rsquo;s like the remote work coming in and this like the rejection of the\nremote. No, you need to be in the office. No, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be in the\noffice for this type of profession. You need flexible hours because you can\u0026rsquo;t\njust produce knowledge on a clock, right? Like a pavlov\u0026rsquo;s dog that oh,\nnow you need to produce that. You produce knowledge from eight to\ntwelve. You build this in your timesheet, right? So it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. A lot of\npeople realize it and it\u0026rsquo;s already wider spread knowledge with security we\nsee in the same picture, it\u0026rsquo;s against just started spreading knowledge, that\nit\u0026rsquo;s not just it function anymore. Because digital is the core type of\nfunctioning for any company today. I highly recommend to Google and to\nlook into secure operating models. That\u0026rsquo;s the topic that talks about this,\nlooks into this problem. We\u0026rsquo;ve got a very cool expert in this in our\ncompany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 07:23\nMy colleague, I might talk to him just to talk him into presenting this idea\nat this forum next time. Yeah, cool idea. Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ll talk to him. So, moving\nforward from this, what our assessments are, because now we agree that\nthis is everywhere now, and now we need to assess everything. If we go to\nassessment just in general, if you Google assessments first, just like\nassessment, the first one will be about education, about people, like\nstudents, all the stuff, how we assess people. Seconds will be assessing\nsystems and first people, then systems. In general, I would say it\u0026rsquo;s the\nprocess is of evaluating or appraising something to determine its quality,\nvalue or performance. We just look at something and say, this works like\nthis. We also define good or bad. Is it works well enough or not? So, very\nsimple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 08:31\nIf you take this right, isn\u0026rsquo;t there a case to say that there\u0026rsquo;s lots of areas in\nthe business that also care about this? I work one of my jobs is a big\ncompany in the UK, and then there\u0026rsquo;s parts of the business that have\nnothing to do with Cybersecurity, that care about this, that are focused on\nmanaging quality, managing value, managing performance. That could be\nthroughout the supply chain, that could be on HR operations, et cetera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 09:04\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the name of this? Just with the abbreviation for the index when\nthey ask, would you recommend this company? Yeah, MPs. So we do MPs\nin big companies. We do pay employee MPs, right? Internal one. It\u0026rsquo;s\nassessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 09:28\nExactly, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 09:30\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why when you will do that\u0026rsquo;s why for example, in defend as a\npractice lead, I am working like not only cybersecurity assessments for\nconsultant led assessments, but also I\u0026rsquo;m in charge of the general\nframework of assessments of all areas in the company, including Microsoft\n365 and all engineering stuff and architecture and things as the\nframework. What does it mean to assess what are the steps in the\nprocedure? We will talk about it here, but today we will be talking not\nabout assessments in general, we will be talking about cybersecurity\nresilience assessments, because this is the one that you start with, this is\nthe one that I would say is the system health check. In our case,\ncybersecurity systems, the whole system. Cybersecurity lens or the health\ncheck and the health check, it can be triggered by different things. You\u0026rsquo;ve\ngot something not working or pain somewhere, you go to the doctor and\ndoctor says, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, I think it might be this, but let\u0026rsquo;s do this blood\ntest and some maybe scans or ultrasound, who knows, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 10:47\nSometimes you feel nice, but you still go for the health check because this\nis your regular one and you\u0026rsquo;re aging and you really want to know maybe\nsomething already changing going on. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to be proactive\nreactive, you want to be proactive. So that\u0026rsquo;s the same principles. And I\nreally love this joke. Because it applies to cybersecurity assessments a lot\nfor me as a consultant, I come across it every time, is that a patient, like a\nperson comes to the doctor with them, complains that, I got pain\neverywhere. The doctor asks, Where do you have pain? I have pain here. I\nhave been here. I have been here. Doctor looks at his finger, Doctor, am I\ndying? Doctor looks at his finger, says, not sure your finger is broken.\nRight. I see. It also like, we\u0026rsquo;ve got this problem with this cybersecurity\nthing. I look at this now, unfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s not this cybersecurity or\ninformation technology problem, it\u0026rsquo;s a business problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 11:50\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what you mentioned, and you have to change your business\nprocess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 11:57\nCouldn\u0026rsquo;t you rename this to say cybersecurity assessments finding a\nbusiness system health check?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 12:05\nYeah. As a business system health check, yeah, good point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 12:08\nBecause there\u0026rsquo;s a direct correlation, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? There\u0026rsquo;s a direct correlation\nbetween the things that we raise in cybersecurity, which to be side effects,\nand business health check, which are operations that are not working\neffectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 12:22\nIt\u0026rsquo;s when we talk about cybersecurity assessments finding. If you do any\nassessment, it will be any system health check. Right. For example, you do\nyour Microsoft three six five assessment. You are checking your health of\nyour Microsoft Three Six five ecosystem. Right, just in general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 12:44\nCybersecurity, I think, has a very interesting property, which is, if we can\nconnect the dots, we can connect a problem with its side effects and its\nrisk. In a way, if you think about it, like if you apply risk analysis to the\noutcomes of your assessment, and if you then connect your risks to your\nthreat agents and your assets and your values and the probability and\nyour incidents, the health check becomes a lot more significant. Because\nit\u0026rsquo;s not just this is bad or this is normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 13:18\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll get there. We\u0026rsquo;ll get there. That\u0026rsquo;s the thing that I see a lot in the\nindustry, and that\u0026rsquo;s what we offered differently. And we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about it. So\nyeah. About this business patience. Yeah. Another thing to be careful is\nthat sometimes people misplace, like, confuse audits and assessments and\njust be careful when someone says, oh, we need to do assessment, and\nsometimes they mean audit and vice versa. When some people say, oh, let\u0026rsquo;s\ndo the audit, but actually they\u0026rsquo;re doing assessments, but there is\ndifference, and there is difference in that. That for standards. So for the\naudit, it\u0026rsquo;s documented criteria. Sorry, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a typo in here. Anyway, so\nfix it. It\u0026rsquo;s documented criteria and it\u0026rsquo;s very strong, like, very strict. Like,\nyou\u0026rsquo;ve got your like, for example, 27 ISO, twenty seven K one. It\u0026rsquo;s a\ncertificate, like certification. They\u0026rsquo;ve got very strong strict requirements\nand you have to check everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 14:32\nDo you meet or not? With this assessments, it\u0026rsquo;s general guidance. You can\nfollow these standards, but you don\u0026rsquo;t have to another quality of our\nassessments is that systematic. Assessments, you can use any framework,\nit\u0026rsquo;s very flexible. You can change it to meet your current business\nrequirements or accompanying or any of the situational requirements.\nWith the audits, it\u0026rsquo;s documented procedures. That\u0026rsquo;s why you have to be\ncertified to be an auditor. You have to learn there are rules and that\u0026rsquo;s\nquite strict. Most important one, I think the biggest difference between\naudits assessments is the trust. With audits, you can\u0026rsquo;t check the box if you\ndon\u0026rsquo;t have the evidence and you really dig deep and show me this and this.\nWith assessments, we don\u0026rsquo;t do this because for assessments, speed is more\nimportant than the digging deep and we just ask questions and people will\nsay something like the answer say, yeah, we do this or we do that, and it\u0026rsquo;s\ngood enough for assessments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 15:43\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t observe, we don\u0026rsquo;t go to logs or anything like this to prove that\nthey\u0026rsquo;re doing this. This is very important to understand because when you\ndo your internal assessment, don\u0026rsquo;t dig deep, just really look at what\u0026rsquo;s\nhappening, talk to people, and it\u0026rsquo;s good enough for this type of evaluation.\nAny questions here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 16:06\nNo, I think it\u0026rsquo;s great. I think you can add there\u0026rsquo;s definitely some memes\nthat you can add to this, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 16:12\nYeah. But just be careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 16:17\nBecause I think that there is that thing where I won\u0026rsquo;t say it\u0026rsquo;s on the two\nworlds of do you want to be compliant or do you want to be secure? Right.\nActually, if you want to be compliant, you can do an audit. Right. If you\nactually want to be secure or safe, you actually do assessments and you\nneed to have the feedback loop and then you have those maturity models\nof understanding where also but also the assessment allows you to add a\ncontext because you want to then start to put things within. Again, I think\nsecurity, we do a lot of this service by focusing sometimes too much on\naudit type things on the assessment exact checklist right. Which can\nactually cause a lot more damage than other things, where if you can have\nan assessment and you have context, then you can adjust much more the\nrisk appetites of what you\u0026rsquo;re operating on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 17:13\nAudits work perfectly with tech side of security and also well with\nprocesses. Audits don\u0026rsquo;t work well with people and that\u0026rsquo;s why you need\nassessments. It means that when you do the audits, you miss 50% of your\nsecurity activities. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 17:31\nI would even argue even on the first one, they don\u0026rsquo;t work very well. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 17:34\nAnything that still better, but on people, they just don\u0026rsquo;t work at all. You\ncan\u0026rsquo;t checklist. That\u0026rsquo;s why but you need all of this because you need\naudits, like you said, for compliance and for other regulatory obligations.\nRight. But just people misuse these words often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 17:56\nLike they just the key. There is evidence. Right. I think the other key word\nthat you have there is evidence right. On this. Actually, Billy just made a\nreally good point. Billy, I\u0026rsquo;ll just make you a co host. You can chip in, right,\nif you want to. Right? You want to just make your point. You just send on\nthe chats if you\u0026rsquo;re able to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 18:22\nCan you hear me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 18:23\nYeah, we can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 18:24\nPerfect. Hello.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 18:25\nHi. Pretty much every business I\u0026rsquo;ve worked in, I\u0026rsquo;m not really a\ncybersecurity professional or anything. I\u0026rsquo;m learning right now, but not\nnecessarily dealing with security. Anytime there is any kind of an audit or\nsomething like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 18:51\nEverybody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 18:52\nIs told about it. We\u0026rsquo;re all on alert, ready for this. Usually on a specific day\nand a specific shift that the auditor is going to be showing up and\neverybody is behaving themselves and is being perfect just to pass that\naudit, completely defeating the entire purpose of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 19:21\nYou\u0026rsquo;re compliant on July 22, right. And then October 714, which is the.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 19:27\nDates of you need those surprise audits where they just show up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 19:34\nOr you need but then this is the thing again, it uses the definition if you go\nto an evidence space, you can ask for evidence that has happened\nthroughout a period of time. Once you go versus a trust based so yeah,\nwe\u0026rsquo;re doing it to evidence, then you cannot just act in one day. Right. You\nactually have to show that you\u0026rsquo;ve been acting like that throughout the last\nsix years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 20:02\nAbsolutely. Yeah. When you trust base because you talk to people and\ngather this information, analyze it, and you are human and you talk to\npeople not by you not ask the questions, but pull these things like\nconversations. I can tell you as an assessor that it\u0026rsquo;s very difficult to hide\nthings. You can fill it, you can see it, how people talk about their controls\nand procedures. Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s move on. We\u0026rsquo;ve got a few more slides to cover.\nOkay, so another thing that we\u0026rsquo;re not talking about assessments, they\u0026rsquo;re\nnot rules, but something that we have to keep in mind. The assessment\nshould be fair and fair, I mean, that you should not paint the picture better\nthan it is internally or externally. You should really be honest about what\u0026rsquo;s\nhappening and it should be valid. You can\u0026rsquo;t just come up with things or\npretend that you see something or don\u0026rsquo;t see something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 21:07\nThey really need to be, like we say, no evidence, but it should not be\nfantasized too much. Some people think about it, but you need a bit to\nhave use. That\u0026rsquo;s why I use cross examination kind of techniques and to\nmake sure that whatever information comes is true. They need to be\nreliable means. That what I mean by reliable here, that though it\u0026rsquo;s not\nfreestyle, there\u0026rsquo;s still structure and procedure to assessment. It means that\nyou can repeat it and then you can compare results. When you see the\nnumbers there and some charts and findings, that you can build your\nprogram or do some actions based on this. Useful, this is important one\nbecause often I see reports that have a lot of information, they\u0026rsquo;re huge\nand they\u0026rsquo;re very informative and interesting from the, again, expert point\nof view. When you give it to business and they read it and they just look at\nyou and we don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 22:22\nSometimes I come across these clients that had this assessment, some kind\nof assessment some long time ago, and say, yeah, we\u0026rsquo;ve got this document\nbut we didn\u0026rsquo;t do anything because we didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to act on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:38\nYeah, I think there\u0026rsquo;s some interesting sorry, there\u0026rsquo;s some properties that\ncome out of it like unreliable repeatable. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting because again,\nyou\u0026rsquo;re almost making it focus on the quality outcomes we want to get to\nbe useful means it should be actionable, something should come out of it,\nright? You want to make sure that people understand it and you can\nrepeat it like reliable. If you make the same assessment every month or\nevery week or every six months, you should produce similar results, right?\nOr else you don\u0026rsquo;t get that, right? That\u0026rsquo;s why I like the definition of\nassessments because it forces us to also measure these properties, which is\nwhat we want to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 23:23\nIndeed. Of how this assessment fit into the cyber. Like, we\u0026rsquo;re talking about\ncyber resilience now. We will talk about just in general assessments. We\nwill talk about cyber resilience or sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s called maturity. We prefer\nto call it cyber resilience. And I\u0026rsquo;ll just explain why. This is the kind of\nparadigm I came up with, I utilize for my work today. That\u0026rsquo;s when we talk\nabout good security posture or mature security, that\u0026rsquo;s some kind of\nbaseline that we want to get to. The company starts their security journey,\nso they want to get to some state, this is a good state of security and they\ncreate the security program to get there. I see a lot of companies at this\nstage because a lot of companies just start in their security journey. They\nuse assessments, they do assessments at the beginning. This is where we\nare. That\u0026rsquo;s how assessments really help to shape the security program,\nshowing the gaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 24:31\nBecause to be honest, I see companies that just like really zero. No, they\nstill have some. Microsoft is doing good job there because as soon as the\ncompany sign ups for Microsoft, they fed all these bits and pieces like they\nsold to them. Some of these bits and pieces are about security. Just it\u0026rsquo;s\nembedded in there like Asia Ad or just going to the cloud in general or\nsome other defender. It\u0026rsquo;s there and it means that they\u0026rsquo;ve got some\ncontrols. What they\u0026rsquo;re missing, like majority of cases is the program, some\ngood plan, some understanding like thinking around, okay, this is where\nwe are from cybersecurity resilience point of view where we need to move\nto. We do assessments for them and assessment report is a huge help to\ndefine this program to the good posture for mature companies at any level\nof maturity. The problem is then as soon as you get to this point, it\u0026rsquo;s good\nenough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 25:49\nThere are some companies, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some companies are amazing and\nthis luckily we have them and I wish we had more. People and companies\nare growing in this area so they achieve this good state. But the\nenvironment is constantly changing. The thing about resilience is that for\nme, I define resilience as being able to adapt to withstand the change and\nstay secure when the environment constantly changes. You constantly\nredefining your good and you check how you\u0026rsquo;re doing to the redefined\ngood. That\u0026rsquo;s what the people not mistake kind of thing they\u0026rsquo;re doing\ntoday. They define this is the good place, we assessed against it and then in\na year we assess again and a year assess again. The thing is that the good\ndefinition changes. You need to change this defined good and then check\nagainst this new good. So there\u0026rsquo;s two parallel processes happening. It\u0026rsquo;s\nlike juggling things, but for the mature companies it\u0026rsquo;s not about just\nsecurity program, but how to change your goals, how to make sure that\nyou check against your risks all the time, how do you embed the change in\nthreat environment and the staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 27:34\nSo how to keep this security posture. Again you use assessment to check\nhow you are doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 27:44\nOn that, do you also measure the cases where security happened because\nyou embedded pieces and where security happened because you had to put\nenergy on it? For a good example, let\u0026rsquo;s say that you arrive at the first time\nof the company, a lot of the security activities are going to happen because\nyou put energy into it, right? Almost you have to use a security program to\nmove the needle. If you go back to your initial point, which is a lot of times\nwhat we\u0026rsquo;re doing is we\u0026rsquo;re changing business processes and we change\nhow the business operates. There\u0026rsquo;s going to be times where you actually\nchange how the business operates so that the next iteration of the business\nis already at a good level of security. You almost don\u0026rsquo;t have to put energy\nto basically to keep or maintain that state. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s a very\ninteresting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 28:35\nWay to you still have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 28:41\nTo, but it\u0026rsquo;s almost like it\u0026rsquo;s the place where you actually got security\nbecause you change how the business operates versus the more whacka\nmole where you have to go, okay, let\u0026rsquo;s keep improving the security which\nbasically via security program, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 28:59\nYeah, you change the business and business changes. Even if this stuff is\nstill like just imagine that you change the business and you\u0026rsquo;ve got much\nbetter security posture now. You would think, we\u0026rsquo;ve got less things to do\nnow, but the threat environment changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 29:24\nYeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t think we have less to do because yes, you\u0026rsquo;re right. Also you\nincrease the things you want to change. Right. But your scope increases. I\nthink it\u0026rsquo;s interesting to measure how much of real impact you\u0026rsquo;re doing,\nhow much you\u0026rsquo;re moving from Whack A Mole to actually doing a lot more\nstrategic things and already working on much more the medium and long\nterm where the business is going. Because the business is also changing\ndramatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 29:51\nYeah. So you can measure whatever. What I love about this simple, this\nparadigm, it helps to just look at this from different angles and talk to\neveryone in the business. Because you add details in here with the like, if\nyou apply to a company and admit to it for the company, there will be\nbusiness risks, business processes, and it allows you to talk to business\nabout it. And I agree with you. Like, security program here, it\u0026rsquo;s not\nclassical security program. Security program is that they were talking\nabout the secure operating model based on the Q operating model. It\u0026rsquo;s not\njust like, okay, let\u0026rsquo;s create policies now. Let\u0026rsquo;s do the configure our controls\nand stuff. Now, security program here would be we have a security\nsteering committee that talks and reports to the board regularly. In this\ncommittee, we\u0026rsquo;ve got representatives from all business functions. We\ndecide what we need to do with people, processes and technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 31:01\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why the security program should be not part of the It department.\nThis is the top business level thing that driven by security Steering\nCommittee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 31:16\nHow do you capture the data that you show there? You have tools that you\nuse spreadsheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 31:20\nHow do you capture data to you\u0026rsquo;re talking about assessments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 31:23\nWell, the output of the assessments and then the translation from the\nassessments to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 31:27\nThe we\u0026rsquo;ve got 20 minutes to cover the slides. Okay, so when we\u0026rsquo;re talking\nabout cybersecurity assessments, we do not invent Bicycle, we use\nframeworks. Actually, you can use any framework, including ISO Twenty\nseven k One, because they\u0026rsquo;ve got a set of controls. You can use any set of\ncontrols as your question points. But again, we\u0026rsquo;re not doing audit. You see\nthis is 27 one k, it\u0026rsquo;s not about audit, but it\u0026rsquo;s using this structure, their\napproach, how they slice this elephant. Right. I call it a butcher map. You\ncan use any butcher map in here. The most user, like the two ones that I\nuse almost every day are NIST CSF and CAS Cybersecurity 18.\nCybersecurity controls for New Zealand is also very important. One is NZ.\nIsm that all government agencies use. I think for Europe, it will be\nsomething like GDPR guidelines or some other stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 32:34\nISO Twenty Seven k One is also a good framework because it\u0026rsquo;s not the\ncontrols one twenty seven k two, but this one is called Risk Management\nCertification. It really helps to understand your controls, how they related\nto risks. We will talk more in detail. I will use as examples NIST and CIS\nand we\u0026rsquo;ll look right now how assessment would look like and what we\nwould use there. Assessment procedure that I use and that I looked at\nother solutions like tools and stuff and then that would be for most of\nthem it\u0026rsquo;s the same. We get the context and just to really understand what\nwe\u0026rsquo;re doing here, what the organization is about, especially for the\nexternal assessment, it\u0026rsquo;s very important to understand what this business\nis about. That\u0026rsquo;s where I have a meeting with the customer and I just ask so\nwhat\u0026rsquo;s your business? Tell me about this, so what do you do, what\u0026rsquo;s your\ncrown jewels?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 33:39\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the most important to you, what\u0026rsquo;s your place in the industry? And\nall these type of questions. Then we create threat taxonomy. We either ask\nthem, but not all companies have it and it\u0026rsquo;s not even the risk register\nbecause often it\u0026rsquo;s not usable for assessments. We just create this risk\ntaxonomy to understand what the major risks for this company, depending\non their industry or nature of their business. We gather data by conducting\ninterviews, sometimes reading documents, but interviews is the main\nsource of the data. Then I do analysis. All these interview answers I will\nrecord into a tool or spreadsheet and we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about it in more detail in a\nsecond. And then I score the findings. Again we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about it, what does\nit mean and what possible in there and then I will compile a report with all\nthese charts and findings and recommendations and then I will present it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 34:39\nAgain the presentation will the type of presentation will depend on who we\nare talking to. It just business or the business and experts, or just experts?\nIt depends. Sometimes I do more than one presentation depending on for\ndifferent audiences in the company. Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look into each step in\ndetail where we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about tools and what\u0026rsquo;s possible. So, context\ngathering, it\u0026rsquo;s important to identify stakeholders. It\u0026rsquo;s not only for external,\nfor internal assessments also it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand who will\nconsume your report and whom to talk to, who will be in charge, like who\nwill help you to get access to people you need to get access to. You need to\nidentify main respondents, just like not everyone. You do not need to\ninterview everyone in the company depending on the context. You really\njust, okay, I need to talk to CFO, COO and CTO for example, and plus to\nwhoever is doing the security Manager because there will be technical\nquestions about infrastructure network and devices and all this stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 35:52\nThen we. Describe business context, just what this business is about and\nwhat\u0026rsquo;s important for it, and create threat taxonomy. So, threat taxonomy,\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of guides, you can just Google it and there will be a lot of just\nlike lists, like trees of all possible threats. I have my guide, I just use it for\nmy conversations. I get this from conversations with people. Just what\u0026rsquo;s\nimportant for you? What the worst thing can happen? What will happen to\na business?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:25\nI really like that. How do you store that tree?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 36:32\nYeah, so it\u0026rsquo;s just a document and for me, just like there will be high level\ntaxonomy sorry, some of the stuff I can\u0026rsquo;t share because it\u0026rsquo;s intellectual\nproperty of the company and stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:43\nYeah, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 36:49\nThreat taxonomy for me just a tree. The high level will look like data loss,\nsystem compromise outages like unavailability that threats, right? There\nwill be something like this. Then inside you\u0026rsquo;ll have different types. Data\nloss, you\u0026rsquo;ll have intentional data loss, unintentional data, like\nunintentional data exposure, intentional loss like breach from the system\ncompromise. It will be credentials compromise or network perimeter\nbreach or something like this. If you Google, you can find it online. There\u0026rsquo;s\ndifferent things because if you are doing assessments internally, it\u0026rsquo;s a nice\nthing to have. A mature company will have it done because usually it\u0026rsquo;s one\nof the things we also offer. Where I do thread taxonomy, like thread\nworkshops, right, so you do like in the business, you\u0026rsquo;ll have it, but if the\nbusiness is not mature enough, especially if it\u0026rsquo;s a small company, we do\nassessments for company with the ten people size, why not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 37:59\nThey also need for the organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:02\nDo you have thread trees that are customized to specifically business\nsectors or particular teams? You isolate a little bit that taxonomy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 38:10\nNo, for myself, I just found out that the difference between business so it\u0026rsquo;s\nmore about stage of the business than the industry. There is huge\ndifference. For example, differences like health, for example banking, like\nfinance, health finance and then everyone else, because we don\u0026rsquo;t go deep\ninto physical security here, there\u0026rsquo;s of this from my experience, physical\nsecurity is in most of the cases well covered because it\u0026rsquo;s health and safety.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of regulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:49\nNo, I was thinking more in terms of the different maturity levels of\ndifferent parts of the organization that will have different threads, but\nalso the assets that they have. If you look at a part of the organization\nthat deals with healthcare data, it\u0026rsquo;s very different from an organization\nthat deals with public information or a part of organization that deals\nwith let\u0026rsquo;s say CVS or HR data, right? Each of those actually has different\nthreads and different threat actors, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 39:15\nI found out that all organizations there will be something like for all of\nthem, there will be shared common threads like all the same. Everyone is\nsusceptible for data loss and system compromise. Right. What\u0026rsquo;s important\nis the details. I do the report, I put there like in what form exactly for this\nbusiness, the threat can be materialized. Right. I was thinking about, okay,\nwe can have different taxonomies for different industries at the blueprint\nto use. Then, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, it\u0026rsquo;s just at the blueprint level, it\u0026rsquo;s the same for\neveryone. At the detail level, it\u0026rsquo;s different for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 40:04\nOf course. Yeah, cool. Absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 40:07\nYeah. So data gathering, what do we do? So interviews and documents.\nYes, and interviews I really enjoyed because it\u0026rsquo;s kind of of interrogation\nand cross examination, but in a friendly manner. Because what you try to\nfind out truth, you try to find out who\u0026rsquo;s the murder right. Murderer kind of\nthing. Sometimes I feel like they are acute poor or trying to what do you\nreally mean? What are you really doing here? Because sometimes people\nreally do not understand how these things connected to security and why\nare asking this? I explained that, this, how it can be exploited. That\u0026rsquo;s why\nit\u0026rsquo;s important that you are doing this or this and this area things. A lot of\neducation happened in Drew and interviewing because people didn\u0026rsquo;t think\nabout a lot of things before they were asked. I really love assessments as a\npart of eye opening for people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 41:05\nWhen you start asking the question what about this, what about that? Oh,\nwe didn\u0026rsquo;t think about this, we didn\u0026rsquo;t know it\u0026rsquo;s connected to our\ncybersecurity and all this stuff. Now, you know, thank you so much. They\nstart thinking in this direction. So I really enjoy this documents. Just what\nI usually do is just to really look at the information security policy few\nstandards, their existence is already a good sign. I don\u0026rsquo;t go deep into the\ndetailing, that\u0026rsquo;s the audit job. It\u0026rsquo;s nice to look at these documents to see\nthe security culture. You can see information security policy, the main one,\nit just tells about the maturity of the company straight away tools. This is\nan important one for most of the cases. There are some tools on the\nmarket. Unfortunately I have to come across a good one yet. For self\nassessment, for internal assessments, when you do it not as a consultant,\nas a business to a company, like to many customers, but if you just do it\nfor your company, there are some stuff, they\u0026rsquo;re all the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 42:20\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s important is not the quality of the tool, but the understanding how\nto apply it. We\u0026rsquo;ll talk about in the next slide. If at the beginning you even\ndon\u0026rsquo;t have to have a tool, you can use a spreadsheet. What you do, you\ntake NIST for example, and NIST got all these categories and functions,\ncategories and subcategories. Each subcategory you turn into a question\nabout the subcategory and then you have a column for information about\nanswers. There will be scoring column for score, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about it and\nthen you take all the scores into the next tab and then you create charts.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure if you look up online there will be something that people might be\nshared because we use our internal one. My personally developed\nspreadsheet for CS assessments. I just conduct interview, I will just put all\nthe answers into the boxes, then I will score it and then all the score goes\ninto this charts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 43:27\nI have this charts by function, by device, by type of the control. They\u0026rsquo;re\ncalled save cards and sales and then Nissan the same. You also put\nrecommendations in another column that will help you to see. We\u0026rsquo;ll talk\nabout it in the analysis, how I look at the recommendations and then\ncompile a report. With tooling I can show you one tool for CIS 18. It\u0026rsquo;s a\nnice tool that you can use for self assessment. But can you see this? Can\nyou see my browser?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:08\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 44:11\nThe links to all this stuff will be at the final slide. There will be links to all\nthese resources so people can just look at it, take a screenshot or\nwhatever. This is like CSS control system specification. It\u0026rsquo;s an open source\ndocument that is shared on GitHub. You even can edit it by creating a pull\nrequest. What I love about it is that if you go to a control, it\u0026rsquo;s got all the\ndifferent explanation of this control even more than in the official\ndocumentation. You\u0026rsquo;ve got safeguards for this control and for safeguards\nyou\u0026rsquo;ve got inputs and what do you need to so this one be careful with this\none. I don\u0026rsquo;t use it literally like it is, because it sounds like audit. Like you\nreally gather evidence and you count things like how many unauthorized\ndevices compared to authorized devices you have in the system and this\ntype of stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 45:16\nReading through this will really give you a good picture of what we\u0026rsquo;re\ntalking about in here. If you need to go to more measured stuff later, this\nalso got all these formulas and metrics how to measure the stuff. So this\none is also good. You can use this metrics as part of your security\nprogram, but don\u0026rsquo;t take it literally. If you go to self assessment, you don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave to collect all these metrics and calculate them. You can if you have\ntime and it\u0026rsquo;s required by your organizational style. If there is need for this\nand budget for this time budget, you can, but you don\u0026rsquo;t have to just take it\nwith not pinch of salt. Just like you don\u0026rsquo;t have to do all the steps literally\nhow they recommend it here, but it\u0026rsquo;s a very good example how you can\nturn assessment into metrics later for your cybersecurity program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 46:20\nYeah, in general you can just start with the spreadsheet and it works.\nAnalysis. So this is very important one. That\u0026rsquo;s where the threat taxonomy\nplays the key role and how it says, like why I\u0026rsquo;m saying that unfortunately,\nChat GPT so far cannot help in here. That\u0026rsquo;s another point that I will talk\nabout it later . That you can have self assessment or you can invite\noutsource it invite like a consultant. That\u0026rsquo;s where the consultant really\npays off in analysis, because this is a tricky thing. You record findings for\neach control or safeguard or subcategory. It depends on the framework\nyou use. You score them. And scoring can be different. Depends. For the\nNIST one, it\u0026rsquo;s very popular. One is like zero. The control is not existent,\nnonexistent one will be exists, but not none efficient. Two is partially\nefficient and three is fully efficient. But what does it mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 47:41\nThat\u0026rsquo;s important part. We look at the control and we do not check it. Yes,\nit exists, it works. We look at the control and if this control reduces the\nrisk that related to the thread that we defined, then we mark it as\nefficient. Sometimes if the control is just not fully implemented, but how it\nwas implemented is this reduces the risk for this company a lot because\nthe risk is low, then we can market efficient because it\u0026rsquo;s enough.\nSometimes the control is implemented in full. Some like technical control,\nbut in our case, for this question, for this subcategory, for example, the\nthreat introduced threat, like we found out, defined in the South Threat\nTaxonomy, the risk that introduced by the threat is not reduced at all\nbecause this technical control exists. Another control process, control for\nexample, is missing. Even if it\u0026rsquo;s a checkbox, yes, we\u0026rsquo;ve got inventory, but if\nthis inventory is not connected to detecting unauthorized devices, who\ncares, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 49:02\nSomething like this. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s very important to understand these\nlinks between each safeguard and risks and threats and then you evaluate\nthem only in the light of these risks and threats. Not just like yes, we have\nit, and now swearing to have it. That\u0026rsquo;s the pitfall a lot of self assessment\nand often outsourced assessments fall into. Again, that we mentioned\nbefore, it\u0026rsquo;s not a checklist here. You really need to involve this\nunderstanding of the business context, business functions and relations\nbetween all the things inside of the business and outside of the business.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where your expertise, knowledge and general knowledge comes\ninto play. That\u0026rsquo;s where you can think about the safeguard and say yes, it\u0026rsquo;s\nefficient. No, it\u0026rsquo;s not efficient. The same thinking is used in the\nrecommendations. Okay, you don\u0026rsquo;t have this what you need to have to\nreduce this risk in this control area and it\u0026rsquo;s not possible just by checking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 50:11\nSo whatever ask, we need this control. Okay. We need to have MFA for\neverything. MFA for everything? Yes. We recommend I\u0026rsquo;ll just use it as an\nexample. Just imagine that for your company it will be very difficult to\nimplement it for everyone for different like for cultural reasons. For\nexample, people are very conservative and they would reject for example,\nmost of your workforce would reject it. Right? They don\u0026rsquo;t use mobile\nphones much, something like this. For you, the risk would be very low\nbecause most of them don\u0026rsquo;t have access to much of the system. You don\u0026rsquo;t\nrecommend them to roll out MFA for everyone. You would recommend to\nroll out MMFA only for admin accounts, for example. That\u0026rsquo;s when we do\nrecommendations based on the business context because the main goal is\nto achieve the balance between doing the business and being secure\nbecause security in most cases is slowing down the business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 51:18\nThis is your brakes. You need your brakes, but you don\u0026rsquo;t use them all the\ntime. You still need the car. Keep moving. Right? So that\u0026rsquo;s the balance. To\nreach this balance, you really need to understand business context and the\nrelationship between risk threats and security controls. And reports. We\njust do every report should have executive summary, some background and\nfindings and recommendations and extra use information. So the charts\nwould look like this. You can see this example of just like the charts from\nthe spreadsheets I created. It\u0026rsquo;s very important to show the report language\nstyle meets your audience requirements. This is very important to have an\nexecutive summary in every report because some people who are busy and\nthey don\u0026rsquo;t care about the details like on the sea level or the board, they\nstill can understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on by just reading one page of it and\npresentation again, depends on the audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 52:27\nAnd stick to the most important points. Don\u0026rsquo;t be boring. Honestly. Just\nsecurity is not all complex, difficult and boring. Talk about business, don\u0026rsquo;t\ntalk about firewalls and access like AJD details like security groups and\nstuff. Yeah, read the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 52:46\nWell, that\u0026rsquo;s the key, right? Make sure it\u0026rsquo;s relevant to your audience. Make\nsure you have business context. Right. Because then they really take it in\nand I really like that risk based approach right, to present to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 52:57\nYeah, because assessments are always about business, not about tech. This\nis, I think, the main message I would love to deliver today. They are way\nforward for the whole company. They\u0026rsquo;re way forward for the business, not\nfor the It department or security team. As I mentioned already, so we have\ninternal, external, we have initial, we have reassessment and reassessment.\nJust like when you repeat it. It\u0026rsquo;s very nice to see the progress. You can\nhave extra charts like in time. Okay, were here, now we\u0026rsquo;re here. And this is\nwhat business really likes. This is like reassessments are really important\nfor justifying your budget. This is what your main tool to get the budget\nfor the next year, for your security function. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s good to start\nthem at some point. Now you can show how it\u0026rsquo;s improving so we can and\nthat you need more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 53:52\nThat\u0026rsquo;s important to have this balance between, okay, we\u0026rsquo;re improving, but\nthis is how much left, how many gaps is still there? So please give us\nmoney. Right. This is resources I was talking about. So this is the NISS\nframework. This is just description. You can download their PDF with all\nthe safeguards so to create. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there is a spreadsheet somewhere\nonline I saw some time ago. Yes, they\u0026rsquo;re definitely there a lot of stuff\navailable. Again, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what tool you\u0026rsquo;re using. Most\nimportantly is that you link whatever controls you\u0026rsquo;re facing, whatever\nquestions you\u0026rsquo;ve got, you link it to business function, risk and threat,\nbecause it\u0026rsquo;s not important if you have it or not.

What would be amazing is see if you can\nanonymize some of your actual reports and some of your visualizations\nand some of your examples, because that bringing a lot more to light,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 55:10\nYeah. Unfortunately, IP, this is like what brings this company, how I bring\nthis company money. It\u0026rsquo;s just like because the tools are not available\nwidely and open tools. That\u0026rsquo;s why we invent our own tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 55:28\nWell, there\u0026rsquo;s still a place in the market, right? It\u0026rsquo;s still a place in the\nmarket for this because you\u0026rsquo;re right, there isn\u0026rsquo;t a lot of good tools, which\nactually we talk about this on a chat GPT session. Right. I think there\u0026rsquo;s a\nlot of evolution that we\u0026rsquo;re going to see on these areas that really need\ncontext and analysis. I think the next evolution of GPT like technologies,\nwhere you can really isolate the data set, so you can say, look, here\u0026rsquo;s a big\ndata set, go and consume it. Now you can query it. That\u0026rsquo;s going to be\ncrazy powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 56:01\nYeah. With assessments, I would be careful to go into the big data because\nI think from my experience, when I started this, I got AI and data\nbackground, technical background. So, okay, what can I do? How I can\nmake it efficient, how I can just really the processes, how I automate stuff,\nhow I make it, like, really, what can I do here from the tool perspective?\nWhen half a year into this, I just learned that the most important part in\nhere is talking to people and applying this general analysis. You can\u0026rsquo;t\nreplace it by no tool or no information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 56:44\nAbsolutely. But you can scale that analysis, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 56:49\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Maybe because currently I\u0026rsquo;m\ntraining my colleagues to do this, cybersecurity consultants, like they\nstarted in this journey and to train them. And when I explain them to them.\nWhat I do every time I understand how would automate because for\nautomation, I really love this stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m a former software engineer that I\nreally love coding and how would I code it. I understand that every time\nthe most important insights come from conversations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 57:31\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 57:36\nPutting aside this, I confident there are a lot of things to use AI like open\nAI type of models in gathering data and organizing data for future\nanalysis. I agree. Just in general, cybersecurity, I see a lot of yeah. Favorite\nlocation. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 57:59\nCool. Well, I think that was that\u0026rsquo;s all the questions we had here. Thanks\nfor doing the session. This was really cool. The video will be available very\nsoon and I\u0026rsquo;ll see you on the next one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna Lezhikova - 58:10\nThank you so much. Bye.

I\u0026rsquo;m global vice president of\nCybersecurity for Go Financial Services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 03:21\nBrilliant. All right, so we\u0026rsquo;re going to structure the panel, start discussing\naround different area and aspect of how modern organization works. And\nI think what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far is organization works either in silo way, so\napplication security, infrastructure and cloud security. We want to break\nthis meat and bring across the panel today all these aspects and connect it\nwith risk and executive view and the metrics that matter. So we\u0026rsquo;re going\nto start on this very easy topic between application security and\ntraditional vulnerability management, between Mike and John. What is\nyour opinion on how we\u0026rsquo;ve been attacking the problem so far and how is\nthis problem evolving in this modern age? That is a data driven modern\nage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Kinsella - 04:14\nYou want to go first?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike Shema - 04:15\nSure, yes. I think we have been attacking the problem, I think of so many\nvulners that attackers don\u0026rsquo;t care about and maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll kick it off like that\nbecause we have so many SAS, dast IST sea. We have so many ways to\nfind vulnerabilities. It\u0026rsquo;s wonderful, we\u0026rsquo;ve got great observability, but then\nwe turn that around and say cool AppSec thinks we should fix all the\nvulnerables or because it\u0026rsquo;s kind of one of those easy metrics to track. And\nI think one of the things I\u0026rsquo;d like to especially talk with John about is\nthere\u0026rsquo;s all sorts of volumes that are cruft clickjacking CSRF Redos, lots of\nlow impact or no impact XSS. I think some things that I\u0026rsquo;m kind of hinting\nat that some other panelists are going to pick up later on, but all of this\ncomes at an opportunity cost as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike Shema - 05:07\nThere\u0026rsquo;s so many more interesting things that could be done and I\u0026rsquo;ll tease\nJohn a little bit. I love to talk about refactoring and rewriting code, but\ninstead of just refactoring code, we could also actually be working on\nfeatures or focusing on the features in the software we\u0026rsquo;re building rather\nthan all the dependencies that we\u0026rsquo;re using.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Kinsella - 05:26\nThere\u0026rsquo;s the concept of so I\u0026rsquo;ll try to address this with the engineering\nmanagement hat on and if you think about application security, a lot of\nour just think about applications start there first. Frequently when we\nthink about features, we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about what are we designing and\ndeveloping for our customers, whether that\u0026rsquo;s an internal customer or a\npublic customer, they\u0026rsquo;re paying in one way or another or we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be\nhere. But there\u0026rsquo;s also the features we can be creating from a security point\nof view and those could be something simple like how to make sure this\napplication is easier to check if it\u0026rsquo;s secure or is it being attacked or things\nlike that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Kinsella - 06:00\nSo I think what we\u0026rsquo;ve seen, Francesco, is going from that point where\nwe\u0026rsquo;re just purely whack a mole when back in the day there was just\nenough moles in a room that we could count them and play Whack a\nMole. And I think a large portion of what we\u0026rsquo;re going to be talking about\nhere is as that number has grown to this crazy scale. We ain\u0026rsquo;t got enough\nhammers, we ain\u0026rsquo;t got enough people, it\u0026rsquo;s not going to work. Right, so we\ncan\u0026rsquo;t have a top ten list for everything. So how do we actually focus on\nwhat we want to do here and narrow that down? So I think that\u0026rsquo;s what\nmodern AppSec is about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 06:32\nYeah, no, I do agree with your point. There seems to be, though, still the\naffection top ten lists. We had the top ten LLM vulnerability OAS top ten\nhas always been top. We had the top vulnerability exploited or the top\nmethodology of vulnerability exploited. And when it really matters what\nare a little bit from an upset perspective, the metrics in the old age, I think\nMike touched it a little bit on before and in the modern age, that matters.\nAnd I think I want to then after later on, ask the same question to Chris\nbecause I know he has a very good opinion on it. So it\u0026rsquo;s going to make a\nvery good discussion point. Mike and John, over to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Kinsella - 07:19\nThe way I think about this. And I\u0026rsquo;m not going to look at a pure metric to\nstart. I\u0026rsquo;m just going to look at the concept of where we\u0026rsquo;re around, which is\nit starts thinking about asset inventory, which we\u0026rsquo;re 2030 years into\nsecurity, maybe 50, pick a number. But we still don\u0026rsquo;t know what the hell\nwe\u0026rsquo;re securing in many cases. And where I want to do is pivot that to an\napplication security point of view. Some of the more modern tools, which I\nlike out there, that you could call them scanners, are not giving me that\nlist of every asset and every vulnerability on it. It\u0026rsquo;s what can an attacker\nsee and what can they actually compromise or actually have some sort of\neffect on? That gives me more where I\u0026rsquo;m going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Kinsella - 07:58\nThis is I want a list which is I want a metric which is something I can\nexecute on, something that\u0026rsquo;s manageable, something that I can make an\nactual difference, not just in that number going down, but in the security\nof my product. So that\u0026rsquo;s the way I think about it in general, I think, is\nwhat our listeners are going to see here as we talk through this is there\u0026rsquo;s\nno one metric which is going to be perfect for everybody. Depending on\nwhere your application is, what type of end team you have, or how your\ncompany is set up, there\u0026rsquo;s going to be different metrics that will have a\nbetter representation of the state of security of your application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Kinsella - 08:36\nSo I think Mike probably going to look at this from a slightly different\npoint of view, but I like to think of it just I\u0026rsquo;ll leave the actual numbers and\nthings out and let\u0026rsquo;s look at the high level and then start focusing down in\nokay, what does that mean for me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike Shema - 08:49\nYeah, and I want to piggyback on that by extending that aspect of what\nare we trying to communicate and how are we communicating with\nmetrics, et cetera. Probably the only thing that bugs me a little bit more\nthan Top Ten lists is metrics that use pie charts. So hopefully there\u0026rsquo;s no pie\ncharts in the rest of this panel. But the reason I picked that up is if we look\nat I\u0026rsquo;m going to just pick on the top ten API. For example, it has broken\nauthorization in so many. It has three or four items or just broken\nauthorization. And there\u0026rsquo;s a nuanced taxonomy. But how much of this is\nactionable? And I think that\u0026rsquo;s what I wanted to hit is the top Ten list giving\nthe developer something actionable?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike Shema - 09:27\nOr are we just talking about the taxonomy of this is a type one cross site\nscripting. This is a type two, this is the type of cross site scripting that is\nblue. Developers don\u0026rsquo;t care about that. They care about what is the\nimpact to a degree. Meaning, how should I prioritize this, but should I be\nusing a same site cookie? Should I be using is this actually input validation\nor is it really an aspect of access control or an RBAC application? Or we\nshould be using encryption in a different application layer encryption. And\nI\u0026rsquo;m rattling a couple of these off randomly to highlight, basically\ndeveloper activities that don\u0026rsquo;t really get called out in those top Ten lists.\nThey get called out if a Top Ten list says Insecure Design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike Shema - 10:13\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a little too vague because if you just invert that and say you should\nhave secure design. Secure design doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you don\u0026rsquo;t have any\nvolumes. It means we have to have a longer conversation probably than\nwe have time for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 10:26\nAnd how do you measure that upstream and downstream? How do you\nmeasure the effect of security design? And how do you inform security\ndesign? But we don\u0026rsquo;t want to offend the OS Top Ten 2021 with security\ndesign making the showcase and appearance. But I really like what you\nsaid on the actionability, and I think from a security perspective, we get\neven stuck on the naming convention because we have CVE, CWE, Mitron,\nAttack, CAPEC, and The Promise. A lot of these are even disconnected\nfrom each other. So we have domain of information that sometimes don\u0026rsquo;t\ntranslate to engineering. Do I need to upgrade a cookie? Do I need to do\ninput validation? What do I actually need to do with this? But on that\nsubject, I think you\u0026rsquo;re.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Kinsella - 11:09\nWorking on a top ten list of metrics there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 11:14\nPlease don\u0026rsquo;t with pie charts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 11:20\nTop ten pie charts that are most hated in the community. But on the metric\nsubject, we often debate with Chris on which metrics are actually more\nmeasurable. And we\u0026rsquo;ve done fairly modern studies, and I really love the\napproach that Chris has done from a pure data driven approach. And he\u0026rsquo;s\nspeaking to several conference about his approach and the data effect\nthat he\u0026rsquo;s seen, but without singing the praise too much. Chris, over to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 11:51\nTell us frank, please, if you can keep the mic, if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to sing a few\nbars, then go for it. I won\u0026rsquo;t steal your thunder, but no thanks, Frank. Yeah,\nso let\u0026rsquo;s maybe for context, I\u0026rsquo;ll start by describing where we came from and\nthese points will probably resonate with a lot of folks in development\nenvironment. So what we had when we started, we had a mature new\nvulnerability management capability run by my rock star colleague Lisa\nfor many years. And it basically triages new vulnerabilities and makes\ndecisions about know when they should be fixed by priority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 12:29\nAnd we use it as a first pass triage, a bit like in a kind of medical know,\nthere\u0026rsquo;s always a first pass triage done before you get into the more details\nand a second pass, and it\u0026rsquo;s a first pass triage for CVEs and the things like\nthe asset impact, the reachability, the remediation, all of that comes in as\na second pass. All right? All those things are important. We talked about\nasset inventory earlier on. All these things are important. The business and\nruntime context for understanding the overall risk, that\u0026rsquo;s kind of the end\ndetermination. But when you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough hammers to do the whack\na mole, you want to do a first pass triage to decide, well, okay, which ones\ndo we go after?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 13:13\nSo the first pass automated triage was weren\u0026rsquo;t using CVSS scores, even\nthough most of the tools in our desktop ops pipeline report them, we don\u0026rsquo;t\nuse them. We use the CVSS base score parameters and other input data.\nThis flow was based on a flowchart. And one of the things was that\nexploitation was a key decision node in the flowchart and that\u0026rsquo;s what\nSysac recommends. But many practitioners don\u0026rsquo;t use the whole\nexploitability aspect when they\u0026rsquo;re prioritizing. And the output numbers,\nthis basically were an SLA. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t high severity. Do I need to fix it now\nor later or whatever? So that was kind of what we had. In addition then,\nFrank, you would have mentioned about Silos and we had a mature\nDevSecOps pipeline with several tools across the stages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 14:06\nBut we wanted to bring the tools and the teams and the data together to\ninform risk. And that\u0026rsquo;s an important aspect as well. Risk doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in\nisolation and there\u0026rsquo;s different tools and teams involved in detecting and\nremediating risk across the pipeline. So we wanted to bring all that\ntogether and in trying to come up with a solution, we looked around about\nwhat was out there and we know newer things like Sys, what\u0026rsquo;s that, how\ncan we use it? EPSs that Jay will talk about and various other data\nsources. And we wanted to know, okay, we have internal data, we have\nabout exploitability, we have our tool data and then we have external.\nHow do we combine all that into something that gives us that first?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 14:49\nPast three azure Risk so we can whack the right mold and some of the\nthings we wanted out of that. So we want to combine all these available\ndata sources to inform risk beyond the CVSS score. And as part of a B\nsides presentation early in the, you know, presented this risk taxonomy,\ntrying to put all these elements together to give a user guide orientation to\nwhat they do and how to use them. We wanted to share the data and the\nrisk based prioritization across the tools and the teams within our\ncompany. So we standardize on that. We wanted to understand and\nvalidate whatever solution we come up with. And this is important. Any\ntool I use, whether it\u0026rsquo;s for risk prioritization or for scanning source code, I\nwill always benchmark it and make sure I understand and validate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 15:43\nAs a product security engineer, it\u0026rsquo;s on me to ensure that I\u0026rsquo;m asking\ndevelopers to fix the right things. I talked about my point of existence is to\noptimize the flow of software versus security risk. So it\u0026rsquo;s on me to\nunderstand these tools. So we needed something that was understandable\nnot just by the techies, but by the executives. If something is ranked,\nwhatever zero or high, what does that look like? It needs to be\nimmediately understandable to both the techies and non techies. So then,\ngiven all of that, where were coming from and what we had and what we\nwanted, we landed on SSVC. And the key part about SSVC it\u0026rsquo;s decision\ntrees. The SSVC was originally developed by the smart folks at CMU Sci\nand it\u0026rsquo;s now been run by some of the same smart folks within CISA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 16:41\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s a way to given different input data sources around about\nexploitation and automatability and technical impact to rank\nvulnerabilities and in our case, CVE. So pretty much what we had all of\nthe goodness of the SSVC decision trees. But it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a decision tree, it\nwas a flowchart. And I really liked that. With a decision tree, one, it\u0026rsquo;s\nimmediately understandable, they\u0026rsquo;re super understandable versus a\ncomplex flowchart. And two, you can validate them. You can get code to\ngenerate decision trees or validate does your decision tree make sense, so\nyou can validate them automatically as well. So yeah, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a big step\nfor us to go from our flowcharts to our decision trees. And yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s\nreally it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 17:35\nAnd at the end of the day, people need to understand of all the\nvulnerabilities, which ones are the most important, which ones do we need\nto fix first and why? The why bit is important and understand that this\nactually makes sense. It isn\u0026rsquo;t some black box spitting out a number and\nyou have to blindly trust it. As I said, given my point of existence, I\nstruggle with that. So that\u0026rsquo;s kind of the journey to decision trees and\nSSVC for first pass triage of vulnerabilities so we can whack the molds\nthat we need to whack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 18:14\nAnd focus on the critical that are actually critical because not all the\ncritical are critical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 18:18\nIndeed, absolutely. Yes. Focus on the real criticals. Would the real criticals\nplease stand up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 18:28\nAs you mentioned two or three data sources because not all the data\nsources can add value and sometimes can add noise and some others are\ninterchangeable. And we\u0026rsquo;ve seen that with the research data that we did.\nSome others are more trustworthy. If you scrape GitHub, you might find\n9998 potential POC, but of that number, just 400 actually have high\nexploitation and verified exploit. And I really like your approach on SSBC\nthat is getting a little bit more granular and taking the various data\nsources to actually go in that decision tree and making it as a framework\nbase so that you can insert some of these data sources that you consider\ntrustworthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 19:14\nYeah. And it turns out if you look at the data sources that are the best\nindicators for exploitation, and if you kind of rank them like that, if you\nstart off with, say, internal data, if there\u0026rsquo;s something shows up in your\nbook, bounty or incident response, the numbers there are let\u0026rsquo;s say an\norder of magnitude is in one. It could be one to ten in terms of\nvulnerabilities. Then you have things like Sisikev actively exploited, but not\nin your organization, but in the wild population 1000. Then you get into\nlike EPSs and certain thresholds. The numbers become slightly bigger\ndepending on your threshold. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t suddenly jump to 200,000. It\u0026rsquo;s\na more manageable figure. And then you have things like active\nexploitation is the CVE in Nucleus or Metasploit, two k, three k\npopulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 20:03\nSo the populations interestingly gradually increase in terms of if you walk\ndown the likelihood of exploit, then you get into active or sorry, exploit\navailable and then the populations then kind of explode. They\u0026rsquo;re less\nuseful and there\u0026rsquo;s more of them as indicators of exploitation. When Sister\nsays use the indicator of exploitation for your risk management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 20:31\nBrilliant. And those are all I like the fact that you end up going to a matrix\nthat is both understandable as priority one, two and three as a single\nnumber that can be made a decision on and it drives away from pure SLA.\nThat is, I think an approach that I like originally, but it very quickly\nshowed a weakness in term of approach because it\u0026rsquo;s flat and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t\nhave all that contextual aspect that you mentioned. But on that subject, I\nwanted to involve a little bit more Marius and what is his opinion about\nthe metrics from his perspective that really matters when talking about\nvulnerability, risk and all these aspects? What\u0026rsquo;s your think?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 21:13\nYou know, it obviously depends where your vulnerability program sits. But\nthe first and I guess the foremost and most important metrics that you\nstart with, as John mentioned, so obviously asset register, asset criticality.\nSo obviously that allows you to determine and gauge risk because\nobviously crown jewels obviously will have a different risk than someone\u0026rsquo;s\nreceptionist laptop somewhere where does not have access to critical data.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s an important start. Then we go into software list as well. So you\nknow, who owns particular parts of the software, what kind of enterprise\nsoftware do we use? So you start with two registers and then we can start\niterating and translating that into risk language. So I guess as we talk\nabout exploitability and all of that all comes down to the risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 22:03\nSo I normally like to split it out so you can start trends between business\nunits. So which business unit is carrying more risk than another one? And\nI think metrics is important but as we are changing and we are rapidly\nmoving at this speed and agility nowadays we can\u0026rsquo;t keep whacking a mo.\nSo I normally now change a bit the perspective and how we do things.\nObviously it starts with a top down approach and support of the\nvulnerability management program to give you authority to actually\nchange culture within organization. Because normally the thing is culture\nis not something that you can implement overnight. Anyone who started\ndoing DevSecOps know it takes twelve to 18 months to get it anywhere\nnear where you want it to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 22:53\nBut what I like is and what I talked about business units and trends\nbetween the risk, I like to see trends in those risks because to me if one of\nthe business units are trending up, yes, we can do whack a mole based on\nrisk prioritization and solve vulnerabilities. But obviously if there is a\ntrending up vulnerabilities, something is broken. So we go to root cause\nand analyze whether there is broken business processes, whether there is\npatching that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work and hopefully sometimes to get it off the\nground it\u0026rsquo;s much harder and it takes much more work but I feel that over\nthe long term yields much more benefits. If we can fix the broken\nprocesses, how do developers code and how can we improve their coding\npractices instead of just fixing vulnerabilities and creating tickets for them\nto fix them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 23:46\nI do agree and I like that approach on historical trends and also seeing the\nthing that matters for two reasons because you can give business unity\nability to operate at specific risk level versus another risk level. So\nsometime risk reward opportunity, you might want to release a bunch of\nfeature because you might go out of business tomorrow if you don\u0026rsquo;t\nrelease those things. And hence vulnerability and even the critical risk are\nactually not the most critical things on your table and being able to adjust\nyour approach on a risk based perspective is really powerful. So I really\nlike that and I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 24:23\nThink it\u0026rsquo;s very important to understand the business context because your\nbusiness context will dictate how you solve risk. Because if you look at for\nexample any young company who trying to grab a large market share,\nthey might have a much larger risk appetite because obviously they need\nto grow and operationalize their product and grab as much of the market\nshare. When you reach a certain level of maturity, you will bring the risk\nappetite down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 24:54\nI do agree. And in some of patterns and trending have you find any\nbehavior also understanding and making the business unit compete as a\ndriver to actually drive down risk or drive down vulnerabilities? There a\npsychological aspect in making team or business unit compete with each\nother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 25:16\nYeah, and that\u0026rsquo;s the thing. It depends how I guess there\u0026rsquo;s a couple of\nangles you can do. You can gamify a lot of it and create a sort of healthy\ncompetition, but it\u0026rsquo;s a very fine line between competition and obviously\nbecoming a toxic. But I guess the important part of it is create an\nunderstanding, create a relatable training and structure of understanding\nwhy these specific risks that we have. Why do we need to solve these\nspecific risks and what\u0026rsquo;s the impact? And I feel that\u0026rsquo;s where normally is\nthe disconnect between especially if we talk with development teams,\nsometimes we just tell them go and fix this vulnerability. But unless they\nare given the context and understanding of why do they need to fix that\nvulnerability, the chances are it creates a learning curve where you might\nnot see that vulnerability in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 26:05\nInstead of just whacking a ticket and say please solve it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 26:09\nMost of the time it\u0026rsquo;s not just one vulnerability but it\u0026rsquo;s 20,000\nvulnerabilities. Like can you please fix this list and randomly choose? But\non that subject, sorry, I just.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 26:22\nWanted to add on that thing. I think as well, normally when you go into\nand expand into various departments, you get a pushback saying oh,\nsecurity is not a problem, but it\u0026rsquo;s about how you I always try now to relate\nsecurity with quality. So security is part of the quality properties. So if you\nwant to build a quality code, security has to be built in. Because when I\nalways say to people, when you left the house this morning, did someone\nlock the door for you? No, you did it yourself. So security is part of your\nresponsibilities in your area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 26:53\nI like that analogy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Kinsella - 26:55\nI want to jump into there real quick because I think going back to what I\nwas talking about originally, you\u0026rsquo;re asking what is application security? I\nthink what Marius is just saying sort of hits it. One of the things we\u0026rsquo;ve\nseen over the last few years is application security was it used to be a part\nof the security team, right? Like those dudes in the back who sort of knew\nwhat coding was. But they\u0026rsquo;re security people. And we\u0026rsquo;re now seeing that\ndevelopment teams are pushing the budget for application security. So a\nlot of development teams out there are actually embracing that they need\nto do this AppSec thing. But at the same time as they embrace it, they\nwant to do it in a way which makes sense to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Kinsella - 27:29\nSo I think as we\u0026rsquo;re picking these metrics or what they are, that might be\nsomething to also keep in mind. It\u0026rsquo;s like who\u0026rsquo;s consuming that metric? Is it\nMarius? Is his directors or is it like a manager? Or is it the dude who\u0026rsquo;s\nactually doing the code?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 27:43\nI like that and I think it\u0026rsquo;s changing and it depends on the maturity curve of\nthe organization and also the ownership. And back. On the first point, I\nthink we have organizations that consider upsec separately from\nCLOUDSEC and infrastructure security, and then you have the more\nmodern organization that look at the full you build it, you own it with SRE\nand Observability, where you have full control of your application security\nstack all the way down to the code and the patching and the\ninfrastructure. So the metric that matters to one organization I found very\npainfully don\u0026rsquo;t matters to other organization and the threshold that\nmatters for one organization and the methodology don\u0026rsquo;t matter for others.\nBut back on the vulnerability overload, I wanted to introduce Jay and the\nwork that they\u0026rsquo;ve done. They\u0026rsquo;ve been fascinating work that they\u0026rsquo;ve done\non EPSs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 28:37\nAnd I want touch on the angle on EPSs and application security because I\nthink it\u0026rsquo;s not a subject that we talked enough and when it works and when\nit doesn\u0026rsquo;t but before diving in, what is EPSs? Jay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 28:50\nSo EPSs is the exploit prediction scoring system and it basically was born\nout of the concept that if what was it that Lord Kelvin quote about? If you\ncan\u0026rsquo;t manage what you can\u0026rsquo;t measure kind of a thing and basically you\ndon\u0026rsquo;t learn unless you have feedback. If you think about trying to hit a\ngolf ball, if you always hit a golf ball and never looked where it went, you\nprobably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t improve much, right? Same thing with vulnerability\nmanagement and basically anything that if you want to do better, you\nhave to look at what\u0026rsquo;s actually being exploited and or compromised and\nthe impact and all the other stuff because a lot of the earlier comments\nwere absolutely right, it just comes down to risk. And one element of that I\nthought was relatively easy to measure in vulnerability management was\nthat exploitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 29:37\nThat we can actually go out and gather evidence of exploitation and I can\ngo into great detail about how we define that and go after it and capture\nthat data because that\u0026rsquo;s a huge part of this. But we basically get that\nevidence of exploitation and then we try to model what it takes to predict\nthat moving forward. And there\u0026rsquo;s all sorts of interesting tricks and things\nthat we can do to talk about how the past can or does not inform the\nfuture and we can measure that. And so that\u0026rsquo;s largely what EPSs is. We\ngather all this evidence of exploitation activity, we\u0026rsquo;ve got a good. List of\ndata partners that we\u0026rsquo;re trying to grow and we use that data then to\npredict future exploitation activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 30:20\nAnd so every day for all of the published CVEs, we publish a score that is\nthe probability that CVE will be exploited one or more days out of the next\n30 days. And we\u0026rsquo;ve got a lot of material published on this. We\u0026rsquo;re just at\nour third paper, peer reviewed academic paper and a lot of stuff on the\nwebsite and some of it we have to update. But it\u0026rsquo;s all out there. We\u0026rsquo;ve got\na lot of stuff out there on it. And so that\u0026rsquo;s what EPSs is. It\u0026rsquo;s all about\nCVEs and the probability of exploitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 30:50\nBrilliant. And there is an interesting angle in here because library has CVE\nand library have a version while code is a little bit more harder to measure\nbecause it\u0026rsquo;s not static like a CVE, it\u0026rsquo;s not a timestamp version. And I think\nwhat I\u0026rsquo;ve seen at scale is EPSs has a fantastic effect where you can\nactually measure something that is fixing a specific version while in code is\nactually more challenging because it depends a lot on the context. And\nyou\u0026rsquo;ve done a lot of work on this. Tell us a little bit more about this very\ninteresting aspect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 31:27\nYeah, the difference between CVEs and what those represent and then you\nhave CVEs in the open source libraries and then you\u0026rsquo;ve got vulnerabilities\nin custom code and these are fascinating area to study. First off, it\u0026rsquo;s just\nsuper fun. But the system, I think, of exploitation, when something gets a\nCVE, there\u0026rsquo;s so many things that happen, right? Information gets\npublished, we typically have something that we can start to log evidence of\nexploitation for. Without that CVE, it becomes super hard to correlate.\nSomeone has this vulnerability. And how do you write a signature, detect it\nand what do you call it at that point? And how do you bring different data\nsources together? Becomes much more problematic without any sort of\ncommon nomenclature. But when these things get published into a CVE, I\nthink that maybe the attackers become more aware.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 32:22\nThey start to realize, hey, this is out there. And when you have a custom\npiece of software that may not be widely distributed and it\u0026rsquo;s only in your\none location that may not have the same exploitation landscape but when\nyou start talking about open source code where it is widely distributed and\nit does become more like an infrastructure type of thing like a firewall or\nrouter or something or desktop It starts to become more like that CVE\npublication public distribution thing. And so there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of nuances here,\nbut it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a fascinating area to study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 33:00\nNo, I do agree and I see that. One thing that I\u0026rsquo;m curious about though, the\nmore we\u0026rsquo;re going to rely on EPSs, whether an attacker start looking at\nthe known EPSs data so the low exportability score to actually sidetrack if\neverybody\u0026rsquo;s using EPSs or everybody\u0026rsquo;s using a score to use the negative\nscore. So when things get implemented at scale, then we have a big spot\nand sore spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 33:35\nYeah. So to answer your first question about are the attackers going to\nshift and start using ups for it? And I hope so. Anything we can do that\nforces the attackers to shift has got to be a good thing. But also that sort\nof goes to why we need to update this stuff. This isn\u0026rsquo;t like we aren\u0026rsquo;t going\nto build a model and be like, hey, we\u0026rsquo;re done, we got it. It\u0026rsquo;ll be good for\nnext 20 years. It won\u0026rsquo;t be. We\u0026rsquo;re trying to retrain these every six to twelve\nmonths. And during those months we\u0026rsquo;re measuring, how is it still\nperforming, how are we looking at 30 days ago we said these\nprobabilities, how did it perform according to the data we\u0026rsquo;ve collected?\nBut you have to keep updating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 34:14\nSo if the attackers are going to shift, and they do, and they will, we have\nto keep updating our knowledge and keep updating what we expect them\nto do moving forward and measuring that performance going forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 34:26\nNow, that\u0026rsquo;s brilliant. And I think you publish on the website several\nexample and I talked a lot several example where EPSs catch up with the\ndata source that you can see, as well as example where EPSs catch up\nvery quickly like log four J, I think, was the more evident one where\nspecific data source catched it or scored it a little bit faster than EPSs\nscored it and then kind of converging. What are your thoughts on that\nsubject? If somebody has to use EPSs, how to optimally use EPSs? Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 35:06\nSo big picture first, it does come down to risk, and EPSs is only the\nexploitation, right? And so it is not an entire risk picture you want to talk\nabout. Okay, if exploitation activity occurs first, is this even in my\nenvironment? If it is, do I have any compensated controls? How am I\ngoing to resist? How am I going to detect all of those things? And then the\nasset criticality and what\u0026rsquo;s on the asset? What\u0026rsquo;s going to happen if it is\ncompromised? All of that stuff. And so EPSs is one part of that entire\ndecision. And then the other thing, going back to sort of the timing, the\nfirst thing you should do is always act on intelligence first. Like if you\nknow something is actively being exploited, don\u0026rsquo;t check EPSs because\nEPSs is a probability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 35:52\nIt\u0026rsquo;s sort of like if I flip coin before I flip it and I say, what is the chance of\nheads? And you\u0026rsquo;re going to say 50%. And then I flip it and I look at it and I\nsaid, do you want to change your opinion? Because you\u0026rsquo;re wrong. You\u0026rsquo;re\nlike, no, you don\u0026rsquo;t have any other new information. But then if we show\nyou and it either is or isn\u0026rsquo;t, you want to act on that information, right? If\nyou know the answer, don\u0026rsquo;t go looking at an estimate of the answer, right?\nSo if something is being exploited, go after that. Like log for J, for\nexample.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 36:20\nWe did a write up on the website and I think in the opening paragraph I\nsaid, if you\u0026rsquo;re around and working that weekend, December 10 of 2021,\nor whatever it was, and you need to check a scoring system for this\nvulnerability, you\u0026rsquo;re probably doing your job wrong, right? I mean, like,\nthe internet was on fire for it and so then to use that as a poster child to\nsay how good or bad EPSs was, it\u0026rsquo;s sort of irrelevant at that point. But\nEPSs is 100% data driven and so it\u0026rsquo;s going to react to the data that it can\nget its hands on. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t interpret people\u0026rsquo;s various connotation that\nthey\u0026rsquo;re putting out on social media or anything like that. It may look for\nlike volume of posts about something and so there\u0026rsquo;s some nuance there,\nbut it does look for other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 37:07\nLike one of the biggest variables that blew my mind was the number of\nreferences in a published CVE is a huge predictor. Just the number of\nURLs in a CVE is a very large predictor. And I think log for J is what, over\na few hundred at this point in that CVE? Yeah. And so the average CVE in\nthese years, the last few years, like two or three, so when you see\nsomething with over 300, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a good indicator that there\u0026rsquo;s\nsomething going on there, right? And so the model has sort of figured that\nout. And then there\u0026rsquo;s other things, like, do we see a published exploit, all\nof that stuff. So if something is published and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any exploit\ncode out there, it has two references in the CVE, it\u0026rsquo;s got this, it\u0026rsquo;s got that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 37:54\nIt\u0026rsquo;s going to be scored low, right? It\u0026rsquo;s looking at the environment, the\nmodel is looking at the data it\u0026rsquo;s able to collect and it\u0026rsquo;s going to score low\nor towards the bottom or something. But sometimes if it\u0026rsquo;s Microsoft and\nit\u0026rsquo;s this particular attribute and this type of vulnerability, it may jump up\nwithout some of the huge red flags. And so, I mean, that\u0026rsquo;s basically what it\nis. It\u0026rsquo;s going to react to the data at hand and generally it does pretty good,\nbut it will be wrong at times. Absolutely. And so if you have other\ninformation, use that first. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have information, like if you don\u0026rsquo;t\nknow if it\u0026rsquo;s being exploited, that\u0026rsquo;s where EPSs is going to come into play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 38:31\nIt\u0026rsquo;s going to help you with beyond the few hundred or a few thousand that\nyou may have evidence of exploitation for, how do you look at the rest of\nthem? And that\u0026rsquo;s what that\u0026rsquo;s going to be good for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 38:42\nThank you so much. And I think it\u0026rsquo;s risk reward opportunity. If you are a\nspecific national state that is going to be highly targeted at day zero of a\nground zero attack, or if you\u0026rsquo;re a particular software provider that has a\nchain of very critical hospital, or if your national state or if you\u0026rsquo;re critical,\nnational infrastructure. Your risk profile is going to be entirely different\nand hence the time to react will be entirely different. While 98% of other\nfolks out there, they just need to be a little bit better than their neighbor.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s where EPSs, I love EPSs because of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 39:23\nYeah. And to that .1 of the pushback that we often get with EPSs is that\nwe don\u0026rsquo;t offer categories, we don\u0026rsquo;t say this is a critical, this is a high,\nanything like that. We\u0026rsquo;ve got a score between zero and one. And the\nreason is, I think someone said it before if you\u0026rsquo;re a small organization, you\nmay have a larger risk appetite you may be more tolerant of taking more\nrisk on, and your threshold for what to fix might be completely different\nthan, say, a large, mature financial institution may consider a whole\ndifferent threshold as being critical. And we got to fix it this month or this\nnext two days. And those thresholds are going to vary. So for us from a\ncentral organization to say these are critical and these are hot, I think\nthat\u0026rsquo;s a terrible thing to do as a central organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 40:07\nAnd I praise your effort on resisting on a top ten score or a scale of four\naspect of marketing because I like the fact that will stimulate the industry\nto go to a more risk based approach and probabilistic approach and\nconsider other aspect that is like critical element and not all of it. And you\nmight want to just use EPSs to a specific bucketing system, but that\u0026rsquo;s\nentirely up to your risk appetite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 40:37\nYeah, go ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike Shema - 40:40\nI was going to say if I could add real quick, I wanted to expand one of the\nthings that Jay you had mentioned mentioning log for J or just like these\nare probabilities in the spirit of what can AppSec do? AppSec can also\nhelp with the idea of run a tabletop exercise before the next zero day or\nthe scary log for J or whatever, take a volume, say what if the EPSs score\nis the magic 100%? Let\u0026rsquo;s just roll that. And that type of tabletop exercise\ncan help you say, well, do we have an asset inventory? Even mature\norganizations probably don\u0026rsquo;t have one, but it can start to help you say,\nwell, we have a pretty good one in the cloud because AWS knows how to\nbill us for our resources so we could find those resources. But maybe we\u0026rsquo;re\nmissing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike Shema - 41:24\nWe have these other gaps as well as it\u0026rsquo;s going to get that sense of can we\nfix this fast? Meaning is our CI CD pipeline, do we have tests that don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave like a break glass capability to them? So we actually have to wait 6\nhours to push through a release. And all these can be done in the much\nlower stress environments when you\u0026rsquo;re not over that weekend of dealing\nwith Log for J. So that\u0026rsquo;s one of those things that AppSec, I think, can help\nwith and spend time on this more strategic, more helpful to the\norganization than just go fix this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 41:57\nYeah, and think about the scramble just in Log for J, about finding where\nit is exactly to your point, like the asset inventory and all that. So sorry,\nChris, go ahead, no worries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 42:07\nYeah, I was going to plus one on what Mike said is in the asset inventory is\nimportant and the software inventory as well is what software? What\nlibraries have you got? The other interesting thing that where AppSec can\nhelp but nobody uses is understanding root causes for things is in\ngathering all your data, doing the data analysis, coming up with the root\ncauses is your software ten years old. Whatever open source dependencies\nor whatever the thing is, coming up with the root causes for all your\nsoftware and data in your OpSec pipeline is a fairly simple thing to do\nwith the exploratory data analysis tools, but nobody does it. And it can be\ndone at your leisure before the next zero day critical thing drops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 42:52\nMaybe I\u0026rsquo;m gonna be fictitious here, I\u0026rsquo;m gonna be controversial. Shall we\nstop calling it threat modeling exercise and call it business continuity\nexercise? Because that\u0026rsquo;s what lock for J was. We were on the brink of\nbeing afraid to be crippled or the zealous vulnerability. And depending\nwho you are, which side of that data breach you wear is still business\ncontinuity. As long as we call it security or upsetting, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be really\ngetting in the realm of, yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s a security thing. As soon as we call it,\nwell, let\u0026rsquo;s do a business assessment of like, do we have the asset\ninformation? If we lose this asset, what is the business impact of that? Do\nwe know that our third supplier or our software supplier is going to be\ncompromised with this? What is the impact from a business perspective on\nour critical survivability?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 43:46\nI found that calling it with different name can bring maybe different\npeople on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 43:53\nYeah, sorry, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to add Francesco. I think it\u0026rsquo;s the way I think the\nwhole industry is trending as well because we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking in the latest\nSan CISO networking event as well. So 2010s were all kind of us trying to\nreduce the likelihood of risk, which always been done sort of at the\nperimeter and edge security, whereas 2020 feels like it\u0026rsquo;s inevitable that\nsomething\u0026rsquo;s going to happen. So how we can reduce the impact and we\nshifted from reducing the likelihood to reducing the impact and actually,\nshould something happen, how do we still maintain business operations\nand actually still take money? So I think that\u0026rsquo;s where our industry is\nmoving now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike Shema - 44:41\nI hear definitely the aspect in the CIA triad availability as the primary\naspect of that business continuity but in the spirit of what you\u0026rsquo;re going for,\nBCP sounds great. And then maybe also throw in like privacy aspect\nbecause a lot of organizations now have a chief privacy officer or fall\nunder CCPA GDPR and there\u0026rsquo;s a difference between log four J. Did that\njust impact continuity, impact availability or was that on a system that has\ncustomer data privacy? So I\u0026rsquo;d be happy to move on from just calling\neverything threat modeling and aligning that language with the people\nthat are involved because a lot of BCP and privacy typically don\u0026rsquo;t have\nvery strong AppSec presences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 45:28\nBrilliant. So let\u0026rsquo;s move on from application security threat modeling into\nbusiness continuity and how can we use the data driven model to actually\nassess hold on our asset inventory that we\u0026rsquo;ve been fighting for years or\nour supply chain that is I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s a new thing. We\u0026rsquo;ve been fighting\nthis since threats and we don\u0026rsquo;t seems to learn the lesson of there is a\nparticular library or a particular piece of software that might impact\nacross the board. But what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen and I want to hear the opinion on the\npanel is the likelihood and the perspective and the amount of time those\nlibrary got attacked made all the business shift in terms of likelihood of\nthose things to happen. Strats happened one point in time and then there\nwas quiet up until OpenSSL, Heartbeat and few others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 46:26\nWell right now we\u0026rsquo;re seeing an exploit of a software library, open source\nlibrary on a very much more consistent basis. What\u0026rsquo;s your opinion? Let\u0026rsquo;s\nstart with Mike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike Shema - 46:39\nI get to talk again. I think Struts is interesting. I think there was an article,\nsomebody wrote a blog post this summer about Equifax pointing out that\nEquifax for the most part fixed their struts, what they knew of within 48\nhours. What they got caught out on was their asset inventory didn\u0026rsquo;t cover\nthis legacy system. I think if I remember correctly, the legacy system\nwasn\u0026rsquo;t even exploited until roughly 30 days after the vulnerability had\nbeen announced. So I guess I want to pull this back. My answer will come\nback around to asset inventory which John started us off with and the time\nto response and the metrics around time meaning perhaps time that you\ncan identify are you exposed to this? The time it takes to fix, but it would\nhesitate to gamify that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike Shema - 47:35\nBut also and maybe a little bit of EPSs would helps out this but the time\nyou\u0026rsquo;re taking away from your developers, meaning you\u0026rsquo;re telling them\nabout all these low risk vulnerabilities or you\u0026rsquo;re just telling them fix this,\nfix this in the sense of so many alerts that\u0026rsquo;s just a distraction. So I guess\nI\u0026rsquo;ll throw in my time as my dimension being a Doctor Who fan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 47:59\nBrilliant. Chris, what\u0026rsquo;s your opinion on it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 48:03\nYeah, so long time ago, I won\u0026rsquo;t say which company I was working in, I\nwas aware of the risk associated with software and open source software.\nAnd just because we\u0026rsquo;re talking about open source software just to\nhighlight, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean all the vulnerabilities are open source, it just\nmeans that 80% of the software in our apps is open source. And we\u0026rsquo;re\ntalking about that here. There\u0026rsquo;s all the vulnerabilities in the software we\nwrite, which is separate, right? So just to clarify that a long time ago\nwithin a company I had put together this software supply chain risk\nmanagement value stream, which was an adjunct to our software\nassurance for the software we write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 48:43\nAnd trying to explain, look across our build pipeline, the open source\nsoftware that we intake, it\u0026rsquo;s a risk and here\u0026rsquo;s why and software supply\nchain and all that and it was like what\u0026rsquo;s all that about? And then\nSolarWinds came along and then life as we knew it changed and everyone\nknew what that was about. So it\u0026rsquo;s kind of funny to see how the perspective\nchanged and it\u0026rsquo;s the gift that keeps on giving. We have the Spring shells,\nlog for J\u0026rsquo;s and shells and they\u0026rsquo;re all these things. And now software supply\nchain risk management, it\u0026rsquo;s become a thing and everyone knows what it\nis, no explanation required. And that\u0026rsquo;s a good thing. It exists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 49:24\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now interestingly, I think, at the stage where there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of\nstandards popping up around it, and there\u0026rsquo;s many in a sort of separate\nrecent effort, I was involved with a professor working with industry, let\u0026rsquo;s\nsay companies. And developing a proactive software supply chain risk\nmanagement standard so people could look at it without having to read\nthe 20 different standards on supply chain to figure out, well, what do I\nneed to do? What\u0026rsquo;s everyone else doing? And what do I need to do? So this\nwhole concept of software supply chain, it\u0026rsquo;s maturing as sort of on the\nback of solar winds, et cetera, but we\u0026rsquo;re not there yet. You hear about S\nbombs, we should all have S bombs, but in reality nobody has working S\nbombs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 50:19\nI think, and that\u0026rsquo;s a strong statement, but they\u0026rsquo;re not at the point where\neverybody\u0026rsquo;s using them and they\u0026rsquo;re useful. My colleague DJ has a whole\npodcast with the thought leaders on that is called Thebomb Show. And so\nS bombs will come as well as a follow on. So it\u0026rsquo;s an area that\u0026rsquo;s maturing\nand there\u0026rsquo;s lots more to happen in this space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 50:46\nBrilliant. And I think with Steve Spring that we discuss about even the\nevolution of bomb to P bomb and softer bill of material that is extending\naway from just pure libraries to actually asset management. It seems to\njoke and go back to asset management, but on that software asset\nmanagement, john, what\u0026rsquo;s your opinion? Are we going to get to that point\nor are we going to just circle on it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Kinsella - 51:15\nI think software asset management, we should have a chance and the\nreason I\u0026rsquo;m going down this path is more and more of what we\u0026rsquo;re doing is\nautomated. Less and less of what we have is a developer has a mercury\nrepo, like underneath the desk or something like that, right? We\u0026rsquo;re using\nmost of us are really shifting towards GitHub actions. I don\u0026rsquo;t know, pick\nthe Amazon or de Aure version of it, but some sort of centralized code\nbase. S bombs, I think are and we covered on ASW earlier this year, s\nbombs themselves are fairly easy to generate, lots of ways to do it. The\nquestion is, what do you do with them? Now you\u0026rsquo;ve got this other thing to\ntrack in your inventory, the tools. Are they\u0026rsquo;re improving compared to\nwhere they were a year ago?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Kinsella - 52:01\nBut still, this is definitely one of the situations where the thing was made\nbefore the things were made to do something with that thing. So inventory\nis improving. I think the one interesting thing back from the earlier\ncomment about internal versus open source code, the internal code is just\nwhere when you create the vulnerabilities, you keep them to yourself\nversus with open source, you share the vulnerabilities with everyone else.\nSo you still have to do something with them. Right? You have to track\nthem. You have to understand where they are. They\u0026rsquo;re probably going to\nbe harder to find since you don\u0026rsquo;t have signatures or sort of more common\nmethods of tracking those things down. But yeah, I think a lot of this also\ncomes down to that maturity model. Like, where is someone like sort of\nboth how big is an organization?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Kinsella - 52:51\nHow many of these cats are you trying to herd? But then also, how\nsophisticated are you in your herding? Right? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. What my\nanalogies today? Do you have a bunch of sheep hounds that are really well\ntrained for your whistling? Or is it like you\u0026rsquo;re just sort of like throwing\nrocks and hoping that the sheep go in the right direction? So there\u0026rsquo;s a lot\nof wherever you are on that maturity model is going to come down to\nwhich one of these tools you\u0026rsquo;re going to be using and how do you use it. I\nmean, okay, imagine if I gift you like a five person shop, some hundred and\n$50,000 asset inventory software inventory system that would take two or\nthree guys full time to run, plus the training, plus everything else. It\u0026rsquo;s\nuseless to them. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Kinsella - 53:33\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s not just the sophistication of the metrics, the tools, how do you find\nthese things, but also has to be matched with what are the capabilities of\nthat organization, where are they on that maturity curve?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 53:43\nAnd I like the maturity curve, but we have few minutes, so I want to just\nmanage touch Jay and Marius. Jay, what\u0026rsquo;s your opinion on are we getting\nmore and more mature or less mature?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 53:57\nI would love it if we can look back in five years and look at the time now\nand sort of laugh at how archaic we are or something like that, like we\nadvance so much that this looks ridiculous, that would be awesome. But I\nwant touch on this automation thing that John was talking about and I\nthink that\u0026rsquo;s so critical. I think it is absolutely critical and more from\nremediation standpoint. So if you\u0026rsquo;re building libraries, open source code,\nanything like that, they\u0026rsquo;ll have some reuse. The ability for people to put\nthat in place, put a new version in place without the hassle is really\ncritical. And so as we\u0026rsquo;re studying remediation times, if anybody\nremembers Microsoft from like 2000, they were terrible at security, just\nabsolutely terrible and pretty widespread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 54:44\nAnd they would put out patches that would bring down systems and one of\nthe biggest things they did was made those patches more reliable and then\nthey started patch Tuesday and made the timing more reliable. And now\nthey are one of the fastest platforms to get remediated when\nvulnerabilities are found and CVS are issued and getting patches out\nthere. They are one of the most quickest remediation things to happen on\nnetworks. Now google is catching up with Chrome being autofix, things\nlike that in open source we need to be able to give people that trust that\nwhen something needs to be updated that it can be updated if it\u0026rsquo;s going to\ncause hassle. One of the worst things actually slowest to be remediated is\nJava.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 55:25\nIt is by far one of the slowest things in any network to get updated and\nremediated because I think anybody who worked with it knows that pain.\nAnd so I think that\u0026rsquo;s one of the areas that from a remediation and\nrobustness of resilience of code we need to work on that remediation and\nfix strategy and make that a lot more painless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 55:45\nI like the example because I think regression testing the scare of\nsomething to be broken and the ramification of upgrading and bumping\nup a library of, God forbid, a source control or a Java virtual machine\nfrom one version to the other that\u0026rsquo;s going to break completely. The\nmethod or even Spring Boot and the rest of the methods are still terrifying\nbecause of the amount of regression testing that people want to do. But\nwe\u0026rsquo;re getting better where risk reward is actually lower and lower and\nreachability versus just bumping up a library is getting less rewarding on\nactually decompiling that library and identifying where is the vulnerability\nversus just pump up the library. Marius, what\u0026rsquo;s your opinion on it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 56:36\nI think we are moving in the right direction. I think especially because we\nare working now in everything\u0026rsquo;s becoming interconnected, most of the\norganizations moving into the cloud. So I think the way we can negate\nsome of the work that we do in some of the manual work is we now can\nstart scaling our governance policies in cloud at scale. So as long as we\nset our correct governance structure and strategy. You can fix some of the\nstuff just by policies of enforcing repeatable processes time and time again\nof how and what you fix and then whatever you need to test. And\nobviously you can again create an automated test where you just have a\nperson overlooking instead of actually person doing those tests. So I think\nwe\u0026rsquo;re on the right track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 57:23\nWe just obviously there\u0026rsquo;s still some time to go until we get there. But I\nthink as technology evolves, our thinking evolves and how we address be, I\nthink hopefully we\u0026rsquo;re going to get there soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 57:38\nBrilliant. And we just time. So I want to leave everyone with the hope that\nin five years, as Jay said, we\u0026rsquo;re going to look at this podcast and this panel\nand we see we advance so much that now all the asset management are\ndone, risk assessed. We have real time information about the assets. The\nexportability and attacker don\u0026rsquo;t have a chance anymore to bridge. But\nunfortunately, I\u0026rsquo;m a pessimist and an optimist at the same time. So I think\nwe\u0026rsquo;re going to face a different kind of challenges and we all going to have\na job tomorrow as we have it today, defending our organization. But\nhopefully it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a little bit less stressful and a bit more interesting\nthan just chasing up a library in a patch. Everyone, thank you very much\nfor the time that you came today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 58:23\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a brilliant panel. I know that we\u0026rsquo;re at the time, if you want to\nleave with the last thoughts, I\u0026rsquo;m going to just do around and do the round\nof very quick last thoughts on the subject I\u0026rsquo;m going to gain. Start with\nMike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike Shema - 58:37\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to fix all the talk. Have a different conversation with your\ndevelopers about anything other than just fixing a bunch of volumes. Talk\nabout design, something like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 58:47\nBrilliant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJay Jacobs - 58:48\nJay, I think the biggest thing is feedback. Whatever you\u0026rsquo;re doing, try to do\nit in a way that you can look at the feedback from your decisions and\nactions, including design and all of that stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 59:01\nBrilliant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 59:02\nChris, I think understand your data that\u0026rsquo;s really understand what you have\nand the data from your tools and put it together. Holistically disclaimer.\nNo live moles were whacked in the making of this presentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 59:18\nI love that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 59:19\nJohn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Kinsella - 59:22\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to say think about your budget, right? So it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if you\nhave 10 million things out there to fix or five, but it comes down to what is\nthat budget? Both monetary plus your resources, plus your skill set. And\nthen based off that, you have to figure out what you\u0026rsquo;re going to do with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 59:37\nBrilliant. Marius?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 59:40\nI would say take your organization on the culture journey and how we can\ncollaborate between the teams and get them together. It\u0026rsquo;s not operations\nversus security or versus development. It\u0026rsquo;s how we work together and get\nthat problem solved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 59:56\nFantastic. And I\u0026rsquo;m going to. Leave everyone with the last thought. That is,\nlet\u0026rsquo;s stop calling it Vulnerability management, application security, and\nlet\u0026rsquo;s call it Business continuity and survivability. Everyone, thank you so\nmuch. It was a beautiful panel. And stay safe out there. See ya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Madden - 01:00:16\nThanks, Frank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancesco Cipollone - 01:00:17\nBye bye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 01:00:17\nThank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2023/mini-summits/Oct/Governance/","event":"mini-summit","expirydate":-62135596800,"facebook":null,"fuzzywordcount":11e3,"hey_summit":"https://www.linkedin.com/events/datadrivenapproachonvulnerabili7118644187322888194/","image":null,"job_title":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752075784,"layout":"","linkedin":null,"notes":null,"objectID":"f675d7113d191f9155bbb6ea47d15e0d","organizers":["Francesco Cipollone","Jay Jacobs","John Kinsella","Mike Shema","Chris Madden","Marius Poskus"],"permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/governance/data-driven-approach-on-vulnerabilities-appsec-vs-infra/","project":"Risk and Governance","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":52,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/governance/data-driven-approach-on-vulnerabilities-appsec-vs-infra/","section":"sessions","status":null,"summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-session\"\u003eAbout this session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNavigating through the pulsating neural networks of cybersecurity, this session brings to the fore a meticulously crafted exploration into a DATA-Driven Approach towards understanding and mitigating vulnerabilities in both AppSec and Infrastructural security spheres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVulnerabilities are more than mere code anomalies; they are the conduits that can potentially unchain a cascade of unwanted cyber events.

And\nthey\u0026rsquo;re going to be talking about DevSecOps maturity model. So over to\nsorry, it is DevSecOps, right? Or is this yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s DevSecOps with TT\nmodel. Sorry, I flipped for a second. Off you go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimo Pagel - 00:33\nCool. Hey everyone. So I am Prakash Gupta, and I\u0026rsquo;ll be walking you\nthrough the DSOM updates. And we\u0026rsquo;ll also talk about the new features as\nwell as the outlook of our DSOM. We have Prakash Gupta as well as team\nof pages for this whole presentation. So before we begin, let me just give\nyou a brief introduction about myself. I have been working on DSOM for\nthe past three to four months as part of my Google Summer of code\ncontributions. Apart from this, I am also a software engineer at Expedia\nGroup. Well, about Timo pagel, I think you already know he\u0026rsquo;s a well\nknown speaker at OSS. So we can move on. So let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the agenda\nwhich we have over for our DSOM presentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimo Pagel - 01:20\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with the new features from Google summer of code which is\ngoing to be covered by Prakash which is me. And then we have new\nfeatures apart from Google summer of code as well as the outlook of our\nDSOM which is going to be covered by demo. So let\u0026rsquo;s start with our new\nfeatures from Google summer of code. So on the first list we have activity\ntag filter. Now before explaining to you the slide, let me just give you a\nbrief demo about it. So this is our newly revamped DSO. And as you can\nsee here, we have a sub dimension filter which was previously present and\nwhich used to have deletable chips before. So you can see we have\nrefreshed this chip set. We have now toggle switches which can be turned\non and off depending on the user choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimo Pagel - 02:10\nAnd we have now included a tag section under an activity. So as you can\nsee inside our matrix we have process as a tag for an activity. We have\nartifacts, we have components. We also have none for different activities.\nNow here you can see that we have now integrated an activity tag filter\nwhich is dependent on these tags which we have now defined. So these\ntags for example, if a user if I am the user and I just want to see the\nactivities which does not have artifacts, so I can just click on artifacts and\nall the activities which does not have artifacts are going to be removed\nand I can only see the activities which are turned on in the activity tag\nfilter. Now having all these chips can be a cumbersome approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimo Pagel - 03:02\nSo we have also added a reset button so that user can directly see the\ndefault view of the matrix. So this is about the activity tag filter. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry,\nif anyone has any doubt, please feel free to interrupt me in between and\nwe can take that out right here. So instead of having deletable chips, we\nhave implemented our toggle switches. We have also added tags into our\nactivities and we have now created another activity tag filter which you\ncan see right here. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to see the demo here. Move on. So this is\nthe second part of our GSA contributions. So overlay for activity view.\nNow previously into our implementation levels we used to have all these\nactivities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimo Pagel - 03:58\nWe used to have all these activities and when a user wanted to know about\nthe activity and they used to click on it, a different page used to open up\nright here which used to kind of break the user workflow. So instead of\nthat we have defined an I icon here. So when the user clicks on that I icon\nthey can see the details of the activity as part of an overlay. It\u0026rsquo;s just right\nthere. It does not break the user workflow. It\u0026rsquo;s already present in the top\nyou can see it\u0026rsquo;s, the dimension of that activity. We have the subdimension\nand then we have the activity name and we have all these parameters of\nthese activities. We have also included the tags. If the user want to know\nwhich all tags fall under that activity, we have also done that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimo Pagel - 04:46\nSo these are all the activities which are here. This is the part of overlay. To\nopen the overlay we can click on the I icon which is going to be present\nalong all the activities. The right hand side. Cool. So this is about overlay.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s move on. Move on to the teams is. I think this is going to be the\nmajor part of the Google summar of code contributions. We have included\ntwo different concepts, team and team groups. So previously the whole\nDSOM was created on a single user approach. Now we have included\nteams and team groups into this. So into the menu bar when you can see a\nteams title here, when we click over it we have a list of teams. So these are\nall the teams which are present by default. The user can change it in the\nYAML file here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimo Pagel - 05:46\nSo we have three teams right now default, B and C. So these are all the\nteam list. Now about the team groups can have multiple teams under\nthem. So it works like a department for them. So we have three team\ngroups here. We have group A, we have group B and we have group C. So\nin the group A we have default and B. In the group B we have team B and\nteam C. And then in the group C we have team Default and team C. So\nthis is teams component. I\u0026rsquo;m going to show you what this actually makes\nsense. Why I don\u0026rsquo;t think that without even having to be able to utilize\nteams it is going to make any sense. So this is the part team based\nassessment. Now, when we go over to the implementation levels we have\nmultiple things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimo Pagel - 06:37\nHere we have on the right hand side you can see Team Filter here, default\nPNC. And for all the activities we can define which all teams have to\ncomplete that particular task. So for example, if I open up in the level one\nof build, we have this defined build across this activity. Now this particular\nactivity needs to be completed by all the teams A and teams A, B and C.\nNow only Team C has completed it. So this particular cell has been\ncolored 33%, which is one by three. So for example, if a team B decides to\ncomplete the particular task, they can click on it and the color is going to\ndepend on that. Now we have default B and C as a team filter. So for\nexample, I only want to see the progress of B and C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimo Pagel - 07:29\nSo this is the second part of our team based assessment. We have included\nteam filters into our implementation levels. So now if the user wants to see\nthe progress of only Team B and Team C, they can easily see that by\ndeselecting default. So now only team B and C, the progress of Team B\nand C is visible here. If I deselect this, if I deselect A, B and C it is going to\nget colorless and even if I select A it\u0026rsquo;s not going to make any difference\nbecause we are only viewing the progress of Team B and Team C. Now\nthis is the team filter. Now we also introduced team groups here in the\nteams component. So what team group means is we can preselect\ndifferent teams here. So for example, we have default and B in the group\nA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimo Pagel - 08:25\nIf I want to see the progress of B and C I can go for group B and similarly\nfor group C we have default and C. So now these groups can be\npredefined by the user depending on what is the size of their department,\nwhat all members are working on under them. So it makes it very easier\nfor the user to see the progress of particular departments rather than\nseeing the progress as a whole of the company. In a team based\nassessment you can see that for every activity we have multiple teams,\nteam A, B and C. We have all the checkboxes. The user can click on these\ncheckboxes to mark that this particular team has completed this\nparticular task. As I discussed, we have integrated team filter as well as\nteam Group Filter into this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimo Pagel - 09:14\nSo this marks the information about Team Pace assessment. If anyone has\nany doubts under it, we can discuss it right here. Else we can move on to\nthe new features apart from GSOC. Timo, would you like to take the\nstage?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 09:40\nGive me a second to do so. Maybe you can stop. I can take over. So now\nyou should see my screen and I go on. I will quickly present new features\nwhich we have in addition to the features from Prakash. And afterwards\nwe will have an outlook. That outlook will be a bit longer because I will\ntell you the architecture of Metrica and afterwards we will hear about\nenhancing vulnerability management. Yeah. So actually Denise last year\nrequested that we have IDs for the activities in the DevSec optimal duty\nmodel to be able to reference to these IDs. And that is now implemented.\nWhat is missing is that it\u0026rsquo;s part of the Ul. In the Ul, it\u0026rsquo;s still the name of an\nactivity which you could implement but that will come one day. We have\nalso other model changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 10:57\nFor example, a big break is that we move from four levels to five levels. We\nhave new either 2001 mappings and we have a fix of spelling errors. Now\nI would like to move on to Metrica. So a problem which I often see is that\nassessments are done from time to time. Maybe once in a year, maybe only\nevery two years. And as a product team I want fast feedback. So I get the\nfeedback. I haven\u0026rsquo;t implemented something and when I implement it I\nwant to see the changes reflected in the maturity model. And that is so far\nvery hard to reach. And I saw that in a lot of organizations that I think\nthat will enhance security contributions. Because when the next audit is\nnext year, so that\u0026rsquo;s far away until it\u0026rsquo;s there and then there\u0026rsquo;s not enough\ntime to fix something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 12:09\nSo I think it\u0026rsquo;s very good. When you did something, you get the fast\nfeedback like you want to have in DevOps. I have two steps. One is to have\nmanual assessments which you can place in YAMLs. And then in addition\nto automate the collection from different sources here we see an overview\nof the architecture. You see on the bottom are YAML. So you have\nactivities where you can fill out. As a product owner I did this activity, or\nas a team member I did this activity. For this application. For example, we\ncan for example have threat modelings performed. So we document in\nYAML we have performed the threat modeling for that and that\napplication. And then Metrica can process that and show it in the Grafana\ndashboard. And if you want, you can also send out alerts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 13:14\nFor example, if your threshold is two thread more links in a year, but\nthere\u0026rsquo;s only one for a specific application, then you can send out an alert\nwith the Grafana tools. All I\u0026rsquo;m telling you right now is just the draft so\neverything can be changed. We\u0026rsquo;re in the design phase. So in case you\nrecognize something where you say that I would do different, please tell\nme. So right now it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to change everything. But we will actually\nstart next week to code. Right now is the time to give feedback. And the\nalternative to YAMLs for threat modeling feels a bit like extra work\nbecause what you do in threat modeling normally is to document it. You\ndocument and confluence parts of the threat modeling. The diagram, for\nexample.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 14:07\nSo there is the source which you can ask is the threat modeling performed\nto a very specific team in case you do it in a structured way. For example,\nyou have a header where you say team members and you have a header\nwhere you say for which application ID or deployment ID or whatever IDs\nyou use to identify your applications. And when you have it in a bit\nstructured format, you can ask Confluence or any other wiki. Is there, is\nthreat modeling documented already? And then the collector can pick it up\nthrough the API in terms of Confluence and then you can check thresholds\nagain and put it in Grafana security dashboards. So that is the main idea\nhere. I don\u0026rsquo;t see any questions. Let me see if I can open the chat so that\nyeah, so no, so far no questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 15:05\nSo I will now dig a bit deeper so you get a better understanding of it. So\nthis is how I envision what I also have seen already in different companies,\nthat you have an application YAML for example, and a teams YAML for\napplication specific activities. And then you have a team YAML in a folder,\nin the teams folder in Git, and all activities from the team inherit to the\napplication. So an activity which is team based is, for example, a security\nchampion. Does this team has a security champion? And in case, yes, it\ninherits to all applications of that team. So let us stick to the threat\nmodeling example. So the product owner right now changes the\napplication YAML adds threat modeling, adds a link to the threat\nmodeling in this case because it\u0026rsquo;s currently not automated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 16:09\nThen the product owner pushes the changes to a Git repository under the\ncontrol of the executive team of that organization, and then the product\nowner creates a PL for this change. Afterwards the security architect can\nreview this and approves or denies, for example, the security architect\ncould perform a check if the link to that documentation is accessible for\nthe security architect, or he or she can review the threat modeling if it\u0026rsquo;s\nsufficient. And then you can show the changes on a security dashboard.\nNow we dig a bit more in the architecture and in order to be able to zoom,\nI use draw I over here directly. So in Git we use GitHub as our source\nrepository and our build platform. And in GitHub, let us start in the\nmiddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 17:23\nHere we will build the needed components like a statistic generation\nmodule, the collector and Grafana dashboard. I will tell you afterwards\nwhy that is needed. And then in addition to GitHub.com, we have the\norganizational space that is all this here in the middle, where the\norganization might want to overwrite the default activities or the maturity\nmodel definition, which activities are 1 second, I need to go back. It all\nhappens here in this right part, what I said so far, you define the activities\nfor your maturity model and on the left you see what activities has been\nimplemented by the teams for which application. Then you combine these\ndata and then you can check thresholds as an alternative to the YAMLs.\nWe can also use the collector. One example might be your security\nvulnerability scanners which you might utilize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 18:24\nAnd there, for example, you use contrast security checkmarks veracode,\nthe defect ojo, whatever you use from that we can grab the meantime to\nresolve, for example. And then we can later show it in the dashboard here.\nAs I said, we think about here on the right to utilize Grafana. A problem\nwith grafana which I see is that we would need to create a Grafana\ndefault dashboard which will not fit to the thresholds which you have\ndefined here beforehand. So we thought about how can we utilize that.\nAnd so far the idea is to use templating. So we have here a grafana\ndashboard application, which we use to create in the end grafana\ndashboards out of the data we have defined here for the activities, and\nthen we can populate this dashboard to grafana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 19:41\nIn addition, when we have a data points, whenever something changes\nmight be the collector picks up daily the meantime to response from the\nteams, or we have a change here in one of the activities, for example, I\nperformed the thread modeling, so there will be a new date for thread\nmodeling. Then we push through prometheus push gateway these metric\ndata, so we have a new time point in the time series database and then we\ncan utilize this data from Grafana. In addition, when we have the\ndefinition of thresholds already here, we can also more easily export data\nat this point in time. So we can, for example, use a transformation to be\nable to show the activities which we have performed also in the DevSec\nOptimity model per team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimo Pagel - 20:51\nAll right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 20:56\nI go back. I have to add it\u0026rsquo;s not a silver poop bullet, because still people\nneed to perform threat modelings, right? So people and processes is a\nthing you really need to tackle. It just enables you to do it in a better way.\nFrom my point of view, people still need to understand that they update\nthese YAML files, otherwise they will get alerts, for example. But maybe\nthey create a filter and route the alerts and spam box. So you need to have\nwork to cultural work to let people understand why they have to do it.\nThat is something you cannot outsource. But I think it\u0026rsquo;s really helpful to\nenhance your culture. Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s still a draft. It\u0026rsquo;s done when it\u0026rsquo;s done.\nCurrently we think it will be done by the end of this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 21:57\nPlease contact us in Slack and the dsound Channel or contact us via\nGitHub issues. Maybe I should show here that there is a Git repository for\nit that you find here. That\u0026rsquo;s also a change. Beforehand. The DevSecOps\nMaturity model repository was under my name. Now you see, it\u0026rsquo;s under\nDevSecOps maturity, model, organization. And we have here Metrica. And\nin Metrica currently, as you see, we only have documentation. We just have\ndocumentations about the architecture. We have architecture decision\nrecords here. So for the YAML we have defined here how these YAMLs are\nstructured. This is the one the teams fills out or the product owner fills out\nfor his applications. So we have here an API version, a Kind, and then\napplication settings. And then we start with the activities. And here\u0026rsquo;s, for\nexample, conduction of threat rolling on technical level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 23:09\nAs I said, very important is that we have a date so we know when it\nhappens. Currently I haven\u0026rsquo;t planned that we have quality criteria or\nsomething. So you just have a title and then you might have links later. As\nI said, it would be very good to automate this because in case you just\nhave a small structure how to document a threat model, you can grab that\ninformation and then you have other activities here like data privacy\nrequirements. It\u0026rsquo;s just a read confirmation or that there is Source Control\nprotection enabled. This is something currently we plan to have it first in\nYAML files, but later obviously you can go to your version Control system\nplatform like GitHub, utilize the API and check the configuration of all\nyour repositories. So the teams don\u0026rsquo;t have to do that manually in here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 24:06\nBut this kind of checklist is the start and then we enhance it to automate it\nmore and more. I should also mention the sponsors. So currently I am\nbuilding this with Access Switzerland. So they are the main driver of this.\nThey are also sponsoring development resources. But obviously we hope\nthat by making it open source that other people will join and contribute\ndifferent features. Go back to the diagram. For example. Everything I\nmarked blue here will likely not be sponsored by Access. So tools like\nDefect Ojo for example, will likely not be sponsored by Access\nSwitzerland. So that is something where we could need help. Or also here\nthe team\u0026rsquo;s communication currently is not planned or other exports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 25:08\nExports mean that when there is an alert, for example that you haven\u0026rsquo;t\nperformed threat modeling within the last year, then you might want to\nhave it in your Vulnerability management system or in your incident\nmanagement system, depending what you\u0026rsquo;re utilizing there and then you\nhave there in the finding. All right, let me go down a bit to the definition.\nSo this is what you document as a product owner. Now let us come to\nwhat you document as a security architect for your maturity model. Here\nis an example for production of simple threat modeling on technical level.\nThen you can define components. For example that there should be an\narray with a title inside with an object title which is string, a date as a\ndate and again an array for a title as a string and a URL as a URL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 26:09\nThen you have the level so your desired level in your application security\nmaturity model and then the threshold. So the threshold here is a date.\nThere should be ten dates for the last 365 days. So that is very optimistic. I\nwould say ten thread warnings for one application but that is how you can\ndefine it. You can also reduce the value here in case you think ten is too,\nless or too much. Then we also want to populate that data to grafana. So\nyou can define the diagram type as a chart and you can add grafana\ninformation mainly no, I think in case you have diagram chart here, you\ndon\u0026rsquo;t need this information. This all comes from the top here. Oh, I didn\u0026rsquo;t\npush this. I changed it, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t push. Yeah, okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 27:12\nI am currently not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s the right way to do it so generic, so that you\ncan really combine everything you want. That makes it a bit more complex\nin the development process, makes it very adjustable later for\norganizations. That\u0026rsquo;s why we defined it like this. But on the other hand,\nsometimes it\u0026rsquo;s better to just define in Java, threat modeling is like this and\ndon\u0026rsquo;t let you define all this. But we said it\u0026rsquo;s better to have this very\ngeneric. Then we pick it up and you can define your own activities because\neveryone will define these activities different. At least there will be\ndifferent names and you have different sessions, different attributes you\nwant to ask for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 27:58\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s why we make it so generic and then out of this we can generate\na schema definition so that when a product owner will update the YAML,\nit will directly tell you if that YAML is conformed to the schema. So far I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t see questions in the chat so I will continue to talk. I think here we\nmostly saw everything which is important. Now maybe this here is also\nnice, the required level. So you saw in the definition of your maturity\nactivities you need to define a level and in that level you can define for\nexample, you want to have a pen test by yearly and a pen test yearly on\nyour level three. On level one you don\u0026rsquo;t have a pen test because it\u0026rsquo;s\ninternally. That\u0026rsquo;s something I saw very often in different organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 29:06\nAnd like that you can also because you have these pen tests two times, you\ncan define applications on level two should perform the pen test every two\nyears and on level three every year. So you have different thresholds for\nthese two different activities. Okay, yeah, we thought a lot about what\nshould be the dashboard. As I said, in the end we came up with Grafana\nbecause we need something where we can show metric data and we\nthought about creating our own dashboard using DSIM as a dashboard or\nusing Grafana. And Grafana is currently the best option, I would say. But\nwith the extension that here, we can also transform the data which we\nhave here and add it to our DevSec ops maturity model. All right, I think\nthat\u0026rsquo;s all I can tell you right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 30:30\nIn case you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask. I\u0026rsquo;m also\nopen for calls in case you want to have an extra call. I think recurrently,\nyou are not allowed to talk, so you would need to write in case you want\nto talk. Maybe we can enable you to talk. So just ask me here or ask me\nlater. Now we come to the last update, that is that we currently work on\nthe merge with the vulnerability management framework. Francesco\nMeker is the author of this vulnerability management framework. We\nperformed so far a mapping. We defined what we need, so he said he\nreally needs five dimensions. So that was five levels. That was a kickoff\nthat I moved from four to five dimensions. I wanted to do this since long,\nbut now it\u0026rsquo;s implemented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 31:28\nAlso we said we need different tags, so that\u0026rsquo;s why. Also we implemented\nthe tax feature currently based on all activities, the non tag in the\nproduction version. But we will change that soon. All right, so this is the\nend of this talk. Do you have any questions? One addition maybe. Denise\nin the start asked me about how can we make it more accessible that\npeople can ask I have this problem and see the answer, for example, from\nthe DevSecOps maturity model without the need to go through all the\ndifferent activities. I\u0026rsquo;m working here together with Spiros, with the Open\nCRE project, which from my understanding means they will grab the data\nfrom the YAML or from the application, and then they have an AI where\nyou can ask questions and it will point you to the different Ovas projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 33:02\nAnd one project I think in the future will be the DevSecOps maturity\nmodel. Oh, we have a question here. First question. These are model\nchanges from four to five levels and some other additions. Do you expect\nchanges to the model from time to time? So these hard changes I don\u0026rsquo;t\nexpect often from four to five levels, that will not happen. I assume\ncurrently that won\u0026rsquo;t happen in the next two years. That was just because\nwe had too many activities. In case we now get an activity boom and we\nget, let\u0026rsquo;s say, 50 new activities, we will have to think about more levels.\nBut I don\u0026rsquo;t see that currently that we will get a lot more activities, that we\nneed more levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 33:44\nYou need more levels when you have too many activities in one let me open\nit so I can show it in one subdimension and level so you can see it better\nwhen I show it. So when you have let me find something. Where we have a\nlot here, for example. So infrastructure hardening we have here a lot of\nactivities so the maturity model is there to guide you what you have to do\nas a next step. But here this field is already like a bit too much. Here this is\nonly here so much because I have to not only relate all the activities in this\nsubdimension, I also have to take a look. What? Do you do in all the other\nsubdimensions? And then I have to place it according to that and not\naccording only to this subdimension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrakarsh Gupta - 34:37\nIt\u0026rsquo;s why you have so many activities here. And now you have to choose\nagain, right? What do I do first of all of this? Why? The objective of the\nmodel is to give you a guideline that\u0026rsquo;s why we now have five but you see\nstill this one here has a bit too much but all the others are looking fine,\nright? So there it\u0026rsquo;s acceptable only this has the match so I don\u0026rsquo;t expect so\nbig changes in the future do you have more questions? Okay, I stopped the\nrecording hi at least I hope I can do that the recording now is not stopped\ndo you want to copy to cloud recording? If yes, you will see an email\nnotification when the cloud recording is ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2023/mini-summits/Oct/DevSecOps/","event":"mini-summit","expirydate":-62135596800,"facebook":null,"fuzzywordcount":5100,"hey_summit":"https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZMpdeyhpj0sH9z34Xu-JPwt1KGX9nR4poPD","image":null,"job_title":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752075784,"layout":"","linkedin":null,"notes":null,"objectID":"e6dd71c27467dcc36777187981061028","organizers":["Timo Pagel","Prakarsh Gupta"],"permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/devsecops/devsecops-maturity-model-updates/","project":"DevSecOps","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":24,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/devsecops/devsecops-maturity-model-updates/","section":"sessions","status":null,"summary":"\u003ciframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQW2T7KbVZcRtPF9pgqT5hSWeemVd8EgwLklmMGNwHp7ggfaWHq_jE7xntJAsuklA/embed?slide=id.p/embed?start=false\u0026loop=false\u0026delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-the-session\"\u003eAbout the session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevSecOps assessments are performed often only quarterly/yearly/by-yearly.

I\u0026rsquo;m actually going to\nbe doing a presentation and again, feel free to ask questions on this end.\nMy kind of view is that I really believe that geni agents and I\u0026rsquo;ll explain a\nbit what I mean by that. They will dramatically change our industry. It for\nthe better, by the way. So I want to explore that and I will go into some of\nthe topics where I think it will make a massive difference in there. So the\nfirst thing is that geni is a big deal. I know everybody talks about it,\neverybody talk kind of it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of hype. And also there is a lot of hype. It\u0026rsquo;s\na bit for some of you guys have been around here for a while, you know,\nthat\u0026rsquo;s what happens, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 00:51\nLike the cloud had a lot of hype, the internet had a lot of hype, mobile had\na lot of hype. And there\u0026rsquo;s parts of it that there\u0026rsquo;s going to go up and bust,\nlots of investment on crazy stuff. But I think the fundamentals are there.\nAnd Max, one of the slides I don\u0026rsquo;t have here, but I want to add is it\u0026rsquo;s a bit\nlike we created Jarvis, if you know the analogy from Iron Man, which\nknow, as you can see in the movies, is a great help know Tony Stark to\nbuild all sorts of crazy stuff, right? But then it\u0026rsquo;s almost like we launch it in\nthe world by asking it to write some poetry or do some stuff and then he\nhallucinates because it tries to help. And then we go and say, see, that\u0026rsquo;s\nreally bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:33\nSo I actually think hallucinations are something quite good and I\u0026rsquo;ll explain\nin a bit why that\u0026rsquo;s the case. So this will bring a lot of change. They\u0026rsquo;re very\nfast. But there\u0026rsquo;s always this thing, right, like people get excited, some new\nthings. And I think we\u0026rsquo;re getting into the chasm bit now because there\u0026rsquo;s a\nlot of people that\u0026rsquo;s interesting, but it\u0026rsquo;s not for me. And there\u0026rsquo;s also a lot of\npeople that go away, what\u0026rsquo;s going on? And some people go, well, my fax\nmachine back, right? But there\u0026rsquo;s always a lot of challenges here. So I\nreally think we\u0026rsquo;re now getting into this chasm bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 02:03\nAnd you can see it, you can see that after the excitement, there\u0026rsquo;s lots of\neven a lot of very clever people, right, and a lot of people that have a lot of\nexperience and they really now saying that it\u0026rsquo;s not a big deal, it\u0026rsquo;s not\ngoing to be as much it is. And I think they\u0026rsquo;re looking from the different\nangle. They probably are correct in the way they\u0026rsquo;re looking at it. But I will\nargue that there\u0026rsquo;s a different way of looking at this, which I think very\nexciting and just about everything will be impacted, right? And that\u0026rsquo;s the\nbottom line. The same way that you can argue that Internet and\ntechnology but let\u0026rsquo;s say the Internet is now impacted just about every\nindustry, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse, right? But\neverything will be impacted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 02:41\nSo one of the things I find interesting is this analogy of gen AI with\nelectricity. Because at the moment everybody in a cybersecurity team and\nthe analogy here was why everybody in cybersecurity team needs to be an\nAI user expert. But I would argue that in other teams need to be the same\nthing. But what you have is we take for granted that you want people to\nbe an electricity expert, a power user, at least a computer power user,\ninternet power user, email power user. But all this stuff, especially I would\nsay email didn\u0026rsquo;t exist, internet didn\u0026rsquo;t exist, even computers, right, for a\nwhile. They were not really the productivity tools that we have today, but\nwe now take it for granted. So the difference is that this change is\nhappening at a much faster pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 03:26\nBut in a way, my hypothesis here is that I would say that everybody in the\ncybersecurity team needs to be an AiPower user because of the force\nmultiplier, because you will make their world. In fact, I would even argue\ntheir happiness in how they operate a lot higher because a lot of the\nfrustrations that we have today, we now have a way to deal with it and we\ncan scale in ways that we could never before. So the key here is when you\nlook at everybody impacted, it kind of falls into free gaps, right? And\npeople should be excited. In fact, I think a lot of companies should be\ndoing they should be very excited and they should be panicking because\nthey really should be looking at it from a very effective way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 04:08\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s also a lot of people that are ignoring it and go, yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s all\nright, we can live with it. And I think there\u0026rsquo;s also lots of industries and\ncompanies and professions that in the past it was okay, right? It was okay\nbecause the incremental change that was coming was 1020 percent. It\ntook a lot of years to do it. You could even ignore it and then catch up\nlater and still be okay. I think the rate of change is very different and the\nacceleration that we have now is massively different. And I actually think\nthat the sweet spot is you should be panicking because you should be\nunderstanding that you don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 04:44\nBut you should also be very excited because you should be able to really\ntake your services or your tools or your products or what you provide and\nwhere you add value. You can take it to the next level. In fact, you could\neven dramatically increase your market because you can now provide lots\nof great services to other markets that before you just couldn\u0026rsquo;t or it wasn\u0026rsquo;t\nscalable to go there, right? And here\u0026rsquo;s the killer thing, right? This is some\nof the companies that are panicking in the last two years. And these are\nnot small players like Microsoft, McKinsey, AWS, Google, they all realize\nthat in a way the gen AI, the AI world is really going to make a massive\ndifference in their companies and they\u0026rsquo;ve made in a way a very good bet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 05:28\nSo you could argue that somebody\u0026rsquo;s been doing this for a while, but what\ncould have happened was you could argue that Microsoft didn\u0026rsquo;t panic\nenough when the mobile came along, even when the cloud came along and\nthey missed the boat, right? They\u0026rsquo;re catching up, right? They took a long\ntime to be at a good place and in the mobile they completely lost it, right?\nSame thing with in a way if you look at AWS for a while, they didn\u0026rsquo;t really\nhad a good AI strategy and good AI models, right? They use in some areas\nbut now they\u0026rsquo;re really bringing to the next level. They\u0026rsquo;re kind of catching\nup because again they saw the opportunity and Google is another massive\none, although they were investing on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 06:09\nThe reality is that I would argue that AI posts can pose an existential\nthreat to a lot of the Google stuff. Like I dramatically reduce my Google\nusage and when I use it now it just feels primitive and I hate it because it\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t have was doing this presentation when I did the first round, it was\nso frustrating to use Google images because it just didn\u0026rsquo;t understood and\nI\u0026rsquo;d have no way to communicate my intent. So a big deal, right? And now\nif we talk about cybersecurity, here\u0026rsquo;s the thing, right? In cybersecurity, in\nthe world of cybersecurity, our industry is also part of the problem because\na lot of the times, if you think about it, we live in the fringes or part of our\nindustry of inefficiencies of other teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 06:51\nSo other teams have inefficiencies or they don\u0026rsquo;t have a certain amount of\nknowledge or skill or to be honest, not even their problem is the model\nthat they\u0026rsquo;re in where they\u0026rsquo;re not given the time and the budget to do\nthings in different ways and sometimes better ways. So we kind of evolve\nto add value there. But the reality is that if you look at our industry, half of\nit or most of it is fucking broken, right? You move the needle from a little\nbit to a little bit, right? Sometimes some of these security products in here,\none of some of these logos, they\u0026rsquo;re more insecure than some of the stuff\nthat we have in our network. So some of them you could argue that we\nhave a negative risk score by putting them in a network, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 07:34\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s just crazy how we have this massive industry where actually a lot\nof this we should be looking at how we improve others. But I get why we\nhad this because there was lots of problems that it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t scale\notherwise. So why market economics allowed the creation of all these\nindustries and tools and companies that exist there, but a lot of these\nfreaking broken. So the thing I want to be very clear here, all the thing I\u0026rsquo;m\ntalking about, and especially the AI opportunity is not about the\nterminator that is a real problem, but it\u0026rsquo;s not to be solved here. And it\u0026rsquo;s\nnot the world that we operate that needs to be solved. That needs to be\nsolved at a different level, the same way that we are able to control\nnuclear weapons and other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 08:19\nAnd yes, there\u0026rsquo;s going to be problems and we will need to do something\nabout it. Right? But this is not what that\u0026rsquo;s about. What this is about is also\nthis is not about being fired, right? Look, companies that want to fire\npeople, they\u0026rsquo;re always going to fire people. They don\u0026rsquo;t need geni to do\nthat. Basically, there is a change like exists in a lot of industries. The same\nway that we don\u0026rsquo;t have professional typewriters anymore, we don\u0026rsquo;t have\npeople that drive horses and carts, right? There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of professions that\nhave been evolved. Yes, it might disappear, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the\nworld that we\u0026rsquo;re getting in the short term here, right? What this is all\nabout is about scaling and making the human better with the agents. And\nat the end of the day, look, stupid people would do stupid things, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 09:07\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re a lawyer and you check TPT to help on a case, right? And you\ndon\u0026rsquo;t check the references, especially knowing the thing, hallucinates,\ndude, you almost deserve it, right? And like these guys here, right? If you\ndo that as a thought experiment, maybe there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a Darwin award\nhere going on. So again, we don\u0026rsquo;t control that. But what\u0026rsquo;s important is to\nunderstand the concepts. So I want to walk you through a little bit my\nthought process and why the paradigm shift that really made me think\nabout how all this works, right? So the GPT thing is actually worth\nspending the time. Over the summer, I took 30 books on my holiday. We\ndrove to where went so I could take it and I really went deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 09:51\nBut the more I went deep, the more I realized that the GPT concepts really\nhit me. And I really got a good understanding because I think each word is\nvery important. The generative, the fact that it creates something, there\u0026rsquo;s\nan air gap and I\u0026rsquo;ll talk a bit, the fact that we pretrain it and we train it\nalmost in a particular direction, I think that\u0026rsquo;s very important. And then the\ntransformer, which is fundamentally how you map the connections, how\nyou\u0026rsquo;re able to provide context between the words or images. And I\u0026rsquo;ll show\na great image. That was, for me, the big paradigm shift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 10:26\nSo when you look at the generative, this is the bit that really I start to\nunderstand the power of this which is the way I think about the\ngenerative, is that you have an input, you have an intermediate\nrepresentation and then you have an output. By the way, the reason this\nimages here suck is because I\u0026rsquo;ve seen image in the past and I was trying to\nfind them and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find them. So this is kind of the best I could find\nwhen I was building this. Right? Definitely need improvement. But to be\nhonest, it\u0026rsquo;s the generative workflow, but it\u0026rsquo;s literally you got an input, you\ngot an intermediate representation of that input. And then what we\nbecome really good is creating really good transformations out of that\none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 11:04\nSo not transformation, but a word equivalent outputs from that are now\ngood enough or are as good as the input and then we become good at\nconnecting some of those dots. Right? But the really important thing is\nthat intermediate representation and the other key concept here, and this\nis for me, was the killer interesting feature here, is that the cost of\ncreating a new output is actually linear, right? So that means if it costs a\nor of course X to do one version, it\u0026rsquo;s going to cost two x to do two. And\nthree four is the same minimal cost and it\u0026rsquo;s actually quite a low cost to\ncreate that other data. And it also means that whatever output you have is\njust one of millions, billions of what could happen based in the way of your\nprompts or some of your inputs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 11:56\nAnd again, that\u0026rsquo;s a game changer, which I\u0026rsquo;ll go in a bit. The transformer is\nalso one of those things that the more I looked at it, the more it clicked\nand the more you kind of start to realize that\u0026rsquo;s how it works. And it\u0026rsquo;s\ninteresting because now when I use Chattbt quite advancedly, I can see in\naction, I can see how he operates. In fact, I now can understand the clues\nthat I need to give it because of the transformer and the fundamental of it,\nof the transformer. And this was, I think, the big sort of paradigm shift is\nthat as the words come along, each word in a way gets assigned a\nparticular set of weighting depending on almost the context of the other\nwords and almost like finding a way to provide attention to say, what is\nreally important here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 12:43\nSo you start to understand, or the logic as it builds, you start to\nunderstand the difference in context of what\u0026rsquo;s happening. And that\u0026rsquo;s\nmassive. So I kind of view the transformer as a way to almost think, pay\nattention here, pay attention there, this is relevant, that is relevant. And\nthen it\u0026rsquo;s like a massive graph that goes along. And I saw this great paper\nrecently from the anthrophobic guys, phobic guys, who actually are the\nones behind Claude Two, which is another really good, basically model.\nAnd they were basically trying to understand how it works. And this is the\nkiller thing, right? Remember that up until now, we still don\u0026rsquo;t have a good\nunderstanding exactly how the language model works, exactly how cloud\ntwo works, how Chat GBT works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 13:29\nIt\u0026rsquo;s one of those engineering problems that we haven\u0026rsquo;t solved, which is\ncrazy, if you think about it, because there\u0026rsquo;s so many layers and you don\u0026rsquo;t\nconnect. And one of the things these guys looked at is basically saying, if\nwe look at the neurons individually, they couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a connection\nbetween the neurons that fire that were activated based on the input. But\nwhat they\u0026rsquo;ve done was they created a bunch of clusters, a bunch of what\ndo you call features, which are basically certain groups of neurons in a\ncertain way. And once they\u0026rsquo;ve done that, then they start to get a one to one\nmapping between, for example, English inputs and the output, or Korean\nor maths or DNA sequence, et cetera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 14:08\nAnd even cooler, they found that if they take a particular, say, numbers,\nwhich provids numbers at the end, but they start to modify the activation\nelements, that basically the neurons. That neurons who basically tend to\nbe activated. So they overstimulate those, you get the results in whatever\nyou wanted. So suddenly you go from numbers to Korean to English to\nDNA sequences to whatever, HTML, et cetera. So that was a really cool\nexample, which actually raises some interesting security concerns, by the\nway, the more we evolve into this and how models can be manipulated.\nBut again, great research. And this is all about the transformer. And\nthere\u0026rsquo;s some really freaking cool visualizations, if you follow the real\npaper about this. Now, this is the image that made me understand Chatt\nand made me understand Gen AI and made me realize we\u0026rsquo;re now into\nsomething massive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 15:02\nAnd let me walk you through this picture. The square in the middle,\nrectangle in the middle is the original picture. So that\u0026rsquo;s the original\npainting. The big picture is, in a way, Adobe Firefly to create a large\nformat of it based on the initial image. But you could see how it flows,\nright? You could see the sun there having this flow. You can see this\nwindow part here. You can see the town being bigger. You can see the\ndifference in colors. That makes sense. And when I saw these images, I\nhad a big paradigm shift because although it was image and now you can\napply the same thing to text, but I start to realize that this is something\nthat you can\u0026rsquo;t Photoshop this, right? You can\u0026rsquo;t do illustrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 15:49\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t create this almost from scratch unless you understand the art,\nunless you can replicate the artist format in beginning, I swear, unless you\ncan understand almost the context and the language and the intent of the\noriginal painting. And that\u0026rsquo;s massive. And then if you connect this to the\nfact that the cost of creating the other edge, another version, is the same\nas to create this version and this is where now you become an art director.\nThis is where you start to look at the intent. So you can argue and say,\nactually, I don\u0026rsquo;t want a town on the left. Actually, I don\u0026rsquo;t want that big sun\nto be there. Actually, that moon represents something else. I want\nsomething going on. You now can art direct this and you can make\nchanges based on the prompts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 16:36\nAnd the cost of creating a new one is the same cost of creating this. And\nthat is a massive change because usually what happens is that even when\nyou take things like threat modeling and other things that we do and\ndocumentation and mappings and languages and even stories, you do a\ngreat first version. But then Tweaking, it is where you spend a lot of time.\nSo this allows us this generative mode allows us to now be very productive\nin the customization, in the improvement of the final thing. But this is very\nimportant. Somebody, an artist, still has to validate the final finding.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s still a creative process to say yes, that conveys the meaning that I\nwanted, that conveys the original stuff that well represented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 17:29\nSo, for example, here you got Mona Lisa on the left and then you got\nNirvana and you can go Adele in here and you get, for example, a joke on\nthe right where you go, oh, look, I can put the Metallica Master of Puppets\nin a cake, right? But you see, that shows again the power of this where\nyou can now go, I don\u0026rsquo;t want that lake on the left. I don\u0026rsquo;t want something\non the right. I don\u0026rsquo;t want a shark in the Nirvana thing over here. Adele\nactually shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be smoking something or whatever something else, or\nshe should not be in a like literally, you can now think about what do you\nwant the message and the creation to be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 18:09\nBut this is the part of the generative where the middle bit now can be\nmanipulated and translated and talked to in order to create the output. So\nyou can turn around to the right and say, well, I don\u0026rsquo;t want that to be a\ncake and that\u0026rsquo;s fine. You get another version, or I want that to be\nsomething else. I want that to be these fields. I want that to be a war zone.\nI want that to be whatever you want it to be, right? And that\u0026rsquo;s insanely\npowerful. So that was the one that really made me think of the power of\nthe generative. And then when I apply that to risk, when I apply that to\nour industry, I see insane parallels that you got. So fundamentally, what\nyou have is this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 18:44\nYou got an input, you got an intermediate representation and you get the\noutput. And that intimate representation is fundamentally what Gen AI is\ncreating is all those layers that exist. And the reason we don\u0026rsquo;t fully\nunderstand it is because at the moment we still don\u0026rsquo;t understand how a lot\nof the relationships between those layers occur in the large language\nmodels. But this is insanely powerful because based on the inputs that you\ncan provide, you can now control the quality and the directions of the\noutput. And it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to create new versions of this, which is super\npowerful. So fundamentally, the view where I say gen AI can add a lot of\nvalue is in managing complexity. So we now are able to tackle issues that\nbefore was just too complex. And that\u0026rsquo;s insane because in a way, how do\nwe scale this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 19:34\nIn fact, that\u0026rsquo;s a simplified version of everything that the CISO needs to\ncare about from a security point of view. And this is even missing things\nthat happened recently. Right? Again, the services on the left is an example\nof services that I created in one of the teams I led. And we had to provide\nall those kind of services to basically help the business. But how do we\nscale this? And in a way, let me now give you some examples quickly on\nsome of the areas where if you apply this concept of gen AI, we will have a\nmassive impact in the scalability. So the first one is communication. We\nhave a massive challenge in security of communicating. It\u0026rsquo;s not just with\nboard members, it\u0026rsquo;s with execs, even within ourselves, with other teams.\nAnd the problem with communication is scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 20:24\nYou can sit down and take a particular risk, a particular vulnerability, a\nparticular finding, and if you have enough skills or understanding of the\nproblem, you can write that for a particular audience. And if you do that,\nusually you\u0026rsquo;re quite successful. The problem is that in security we have\nliterally every part of the business is our stakeholders. So we need to have\nmessages that goes all the way from pure financial, to communications, to\ncustomer focus, to pure technical, to strategic whatever, right? So the bet\nthat I never could see how we could scale was how we could figure out\nhow to communicate to a target audience. And fundamentally before chat\nGPT, the idea, and I tried to ask my teams, but of course that it could\nnever have worked, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 21:14\nBecause the idea is that we have a message and we will go, okay, so we\nneed to take that message and we need to give it for that particular person\nor that particular team in their particular language, in their particular\nculture, in a way, in the particular state of understanding that they got.\nThat is ridiculous. Right? Because the engineering cost and the bill to do\nthat will be too greater. And then you have 20 of those stakeholders, or ten\nof those or 50 stakeholders where each one of those really needs a\nconsistent message, but it needs to be translated, like I said, in their\nlanguage, in their culture and their understanding, in their skill set, their\nbackground and all that. But now we can because in practical terms, you\ncan have a prompt and I\u0026rsquo;ll show some examples in a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:01\nWe have a prompt say, hey, you are an advisor. Here is the communication\nI want to give. Now explain this to a particular audience and guess what?\nChat GBT or whatever, what you\u0026rsquo;re using is able to do that. And ironically,\nthat\u0026rsquo;s what they\u0026rsquo;re really good at. So Hallucinations I think, is a good\nthing because they really show that the limitations of what is supposed to\nbe doing and it shows that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be taking some of the outputs at\nface value. But the point here is that what it allows you to do is allows you\nto take a professional and say, I want to communicate this and this is my\nintent. And then allows Chat GBT to go, cool, what about this? And then\nyou read it and you\u0026rsquo;re going, yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s what I want to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:47\nSometimes it may go E, that\u0026rsquo;s even better way of saying what I want to\nsay than I was able to do. But it\u0026rsquo;s still you validating. It\u0026rsquo;s still you basically\nsaying, this is my idea, or this is what I want to say is this that is now\ntranslated in all sorts of different languages and cultures, which I think is\ninsanely powerful. So I think communication is an area that is going to\nmake a crazy difference, right? And if you want to see a good example of\ncommunication failure, today is risk. So for the first time we have the\nability to scale our risks. We have the ability to create risks, ability to scale\nthe creation of risk, scale the mapping of risk, scale the connection of\nrisks and scale the explanation and the risk acceptance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 23:34\nAnd before now, all of these required in a way, insane amount of\nengineering, insane amount of graphs. And even then it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t really\nwork. Now when you add to the mix the ability to take a message and\ntransform that message based on a particular set of rules and intent and\nrequirements and data sources and that can be translated into, again,\ndifferent languages, different cultures, different experiences, different\nanalogies, different this is really important and different context of\nunderstanding. So it means you\u0026rsquo;re taking into account where the other\nperson is in their knowledge and you continue from there, which is always\nthe best way to teach, the best way to communicate because you\u0026rsquo;re\nproviding information that\u0026rsquo;s almost like 100% relevant to that particular\nindividual. We can now do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 24:26\nSo imagine if you\u0026rsquo;re talking to a board members, you can now create\ncustomized messages to each one. Why is it important? How does it relate\nto an MBA? Okay, here\u0026rsquo;s the risk data from a point of view of an MBA\nCFO. Here\u0026rsquo;s the risk point of view. CFO, Chief People Officer here\u0026rsquo;s the\nsame risk from the point of view of people. In the past we tried to do this,\nbut he couldn\u0026rsquo;t really scale. Now he can. But you can keep going down.\nYou can go to the execs and then to the teams and then the project\nmanagers and even to the developers. You can have almost like the same\nrisk explained completely vertical on the whole organization. And you can\nthen say, hey engineer, you need to do XYZ. Here\u0026rsquo;s why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 25:06\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s why it matters in a way that it makes sense to you that it\nconnects with a wider even business direction, objective and risk to the\nbusiness. So we can now create all these translations that in a way the risk\nis still the same or the model is still the same, but the views of it are all\ndifferent and that\u0026rsquo;s massive. So I think for the first time we\u0026rsquo;re going to be\nable to really do something I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to do and I\u0026rsquo;ve done to some\nextent, but it\u0026rsquo;s really hard. But I feel now much more possible, which is to\nhave a direct connection between the top level risk of the company and the\nrisks that the individuals that are doing something about it actually are\naware of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 25:47\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s a connection behind all the way in a graph, but also in context\nall the way there. And this is super critical. So that means that somebody,\nfor example, in the cybersecurity team or an engineering team that is\ndoing something, they should know exactly what risks they\u0026rsquo;re mitigating\nand maybe even what risks they\u0026rsquo;re creating. And then when we go to the\nprogram owners, we do the same thing. So this is a really great way to\nscale. And if you want another area where it\u0026rsquo;s not being effective today is\nthird party vendor management. And part of the reason is because even if\nyou have a good mature process, and even if you tweak a little bit, it\u0026rsquo;s still\nspreadsheet driven. It\u0026rsquo;s still very non context specific.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 26:29\nBecause even if you mature have tons of questions, tons of things, and\nmaybe you\u0026rsquo;ve been tweaking a little bit, that\u0026rsquo;s nowhere where we need to\nbe. Because what we need to do is this is a good example of bots. And\nagain, take into account that these days you can already have private\nbots, private LLMs that run in your cloud environments, run in your data\ncenter. So the idea of data leakage and influencing models, we kind of\npass that, which is great. And also in a lot of these things we don\u0026rsquo;t really\nneed to tweak the model itself. What we need to do is add good\ninformation for the model to understand. So if you imagine here you can\nsay, all right, you are a third party vendor management bot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 27:09\nHere is our current vendor management policy and structures and\nquestions and this is what we need to know. Here\u0026rsquo;s why we need to know\nthat. That\u0026rsquo;s quite important. So then there\u0026rsquo;s consistency. And now here\u0026rsquo;s a\nparticular vendor. Now for example, we can even say the bot, okay, start\nasking questions and. Chat DBT can already do this, by the way, and you\ncan say, hey, have a conversation with these third parties. So now the bot\ncan start asking questions to the third party, can be given information, and\nthen you can provide guidance to the third party. Okay? So you need to\nimplement this. This you care about, this you don\u0026rsquo;t care about that. Yes,\nbased on your team size, you could do internally, actually, there\u0026rsquo;s no way\nwith your current team size you can do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 27:47\nSo you need to find a vendor, for example, that will give you this you can\neven create a brief. Here\u0026rsquo;s a brief for your vendor, so you can see that we\ncan now take a lot more ownership on helping our third party, which, by\nthe way, is part of our supply chain. So they\u0026rsquo;re critical part of your\ninfrastructure from security point of view. But we can not only be able to\nevaluate them better, be able to make better security decisions, especially\nin the procurement stage, but also we can help for the vendor that we\u0026rsquo;re\nworking on, we can help to make them more secure, we can help to raise\nthe bar at the end. And actually, we done a lot of costs for us because we\njust implement the bots, implement the agents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 28:23\nAnd this is kind of what I mean by the agents, which is these bots that act\non behalf. And you have multiple agents working together, documentation,\nwhich is one of those things that got thrown away in the last 1015 years as\nwe gained speeds. And yes, there\u0026rsquo;s an argument to be said that in the past\nwas probably a bit over the top. Again, it didn\u0026rsquo;t really scale and it was\nquite costly, but we kind of went to a mode where not everybody does it,\nbut a lot of teams go, oh, the documentation is the code, and we are agile.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t documentation and we don\u0026rsquo;t have diagrams, and our system is\nnot we can\u0026rsquo;t stop to draw the whole thing and how it works. Which is\nridiculous, right? Because if you think about it, they want it\u0026rsquo;s just that they\ndon\u0026rsquo;t have the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 29:07\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s not that if you go to a team and say, hey, you need to maintain the\nsystem, would you like to have very highly deep tell documentation about\nhow it works? Why the decisions were made, what\u0026rsquo;s the behavior, what\u0026rsquo;s\nthe flow? Data paths between here, architecture, how does it work even\nvisually? Because that\u0026rsquo;s how people like to think. Everybody would say,\nyeah, give me to me. Right? The problem is how to get it done. So one of\nthe insane powers that you now can do with the LLMs is you can use it to\ndocument it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 29:35\nA simple example is take a Git diff and feed it to Chat GPT and you get\nsome amazing technical explanation of what just happened that commit,\nand you can say, give me a business analysis of this, give me a technical\nanalysis, give me a security analysis of this. And so we now can get to the\npoint where we can really document effectively our code and we can start\nto have a much bigger 3D view of our code, of our structures, of our\nenvironments, and we also can start to capture the meaning of it. So\nimagine how awesome would be to be able to describe. Here is what\u0026rsquo;s\nhappening in this cloud formation script, which by the way is completely\nunreadable beyond a certain point. Right? Here\u0026rsquo;s this helm chart, here is\nthis code commit, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 30:18\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the intent, or here\u0026rsquo;s the intent of the changes you\u0026rsquo;re making.\nNow think about how awesome would be to go whoa, hold on, the intent\nchanged and that\u0026rsquo;s suddenly something that will always go, not always,\nbut would sometimes go under the radar because it was not obvious. That\nparticular change of intents and maybe this change of intent is not even in\nthe second, 3rd, 4th level is on the fifth and the 6th, or maybe the\ninterconnection between systems. All these things I just spoke for the last\nminute were absolutely impossible to do, require a huge amount of\nengineering time and money to do it and actually nobody really done it\nproperly, which is why we don\u0026rsquo;t have it today in our workflows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 30:57\nBut that all changes because now we can really start to understand and\nwe can get chatgbt to start explaining the materials, what\u0026rsquo;s going on. And\nby the way, all this should be version controlled. So this is not about\ncreating materials and stuff on the fly. This is like we should be using and\nverifying the outputs. But the speed that you have and almost the\nexperience is completely different. I like to read the commits analysis\ncreated by chatgbt of the code that I just commit and I actually find it\nquite interesting because A before I don\u0026rsquo;t have to write it b because I\u0026rsquo;ll go\noh yeah, I also changed that I catch things and I can fix things quickly\nbecause that\u0026rsquo;s not really what happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 31:39\nSo you can get rid of that but it\u0026rsquo;s so much more effective and it becomes\npart of your commit workflow. So again, this is going to be massive threat\nmodeling. Listening to a Gary McGraw amazing podcast the other day\nand one of the things he said is that one of the problems we need to do is\nwe need to scale threat modeling. We haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out a way to scale\nthreat modeling. And I completely agree, threat modeling is an amazing\npractice, done well, makes massive difference. It\u0026rsquo;s a great way to\ncommunicate, great way to teach, great way to understand what\u0026rsquo;s\nhappening, great way to model threats fundamentally what the name says.\nBut we can never scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:13\nAnd we can never scale because how many of you guys then thread model\nwhere literally it starts by somebody saying yeah, this is how my system\nworks, right? They start to draw it. Think about how many degrees of\nfailure we already are. Because if you have to draw your architecture\nmeans that architecture only lives in your head, means there\u0026rsquo;s no up to\ndate environment that you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable to actually represent what\nhappens in the real world, we can now do something about it. So imagine\nnot just threat modeling being used to create better materials, but then\nmodeling the threads. And again, the other problem with threat modeling\nwas the explosion of potential threats that had not a lot of context, which\nalways reduced the value of the threat model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:56\nSo we can now have context, we can have risks, we can have\nenvironments, we can have controls, and then we can say, okay, here\u0026rsquo;s the\nmodel of what\u0026rsquo;s up, here\u0026rsquo;s the threats. But now apply the context and\nsuddenly you get a much smaller but highly focused and realistic set of\nthreats and risks connected to that. What are you analyzing so very\nexciting about how we can now start to scale threat modeling using the\nGenai stuff. And again, code reviews, like I kind of covered already. But\nimagine a Gen AI powered code review where you can also start to ask a\nlot more interesting questions and capture those questions and scale and\nstart to talk with the bots about the intent. So I have some really\ninteresting conversations with Chat GBT, and I have to say that the\nanswers are amazing sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:45\nAnd I have these full on conversations, what about this, what about that?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like having this copilot, right? Literally this helper that has a lot of\nwide set of knowledge, doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be all perfect, that\u0026rsquo;s fine. But he\nreally helps a lot and he really augments it. And one of the last ones,\ninstance response, right? Imagine an instance response world now driven\nby Gen AI. There\u0026rsquo;s a great session that was done yesterday about a tool to\nrecreate a lot of attack trees and basically possible scenarios based on the\nattack mitra framework. Really cool stuff, right? But so, again, on instant\nresponse, there\u0026rsquo;s so many areas that we can start to have a good amount\nof context so we can say, what happened here? What\u0026rsquo;s the problem? This.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s this signal? What\u0026rsquo;s that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 34:32\nSo we can really lower the noise that we\u0026rsquo;ve got, but increase dramatically\nthe signals that we have here. And training is an area that I\u0026rsquo;m actually\nquite passionate about. And I do think that this could be one of the biggest\ngame changer, which is we now will have the ability to create custom\ntraining materials that are adapted to an individual, to a particular\nculture, to a particular language, to a particular understanding. And we\ncan create this personalized patch, which I feel was always the problem\nwith the more traditional training. That had to be a lot more generic\nbecause there was a wider audience, but also the cost of customizing the\ntraining was always quite high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 35:16\nSo if you look at some of the people that are talking about gen AI in Africa\nand other developing countries and environments, that basically it\u0026rsquo;s like\nactually what happened in Africa, where they jumped from phone lines to\nmobile, right? They almost skipped a generation, which can be sometimes\nquite good because then you don\u0026rsquo;t have legacy. But it\u0026rsquo;s not just that. I feel\nthat even when we talk about skills transfer and bringing people from\nother industries into our industry, we now have the ability to create highly\ncustomized training packages, environments that you can talk to, you can\nask things. You can go to chat DBT and say, hey, I want to learn this.\nExplain it to me, or give me a training plan, or ask me questions, or give\nme almost like, the ways to learn. And it\u0026rsquo;s okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:04\nYou need to figure out the best way that you can learn or somebody can\nlearn. But I feel that can scale a lot. And in cybersecurity, a lot of things\nthat we do is training. Training our teams, training others, educating,\ncommunicating. So I think this could be massive, right? Been talking for a\nwhile. There\u0026rsquo;s just one more little topic I want to talk about. When I learn\nthese things, I kind of like to basically be hands on, and I like to be\ninvolved in sort of practical ways because or else you just go on tangent,\nright? So one of the problems that we know is, how do you make board\nmembers understand cybersecurity? That\u0026rsquo;s quite a common problem. We\neven have a session today, and there\u0026rsquo;s common sessions about literally\nhow do you communicate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:48\nAnd also, board members want to know about cybersecurity because they\nalso know that in some ways, they start to be accountable. So how do you\nmake a board member understand and have a safe place for them to talk\nand engage about cybersecurity? So playing around with it. So we kind of\ncreated the cyberboardroom.com, which you can go right now and create\nan account. It\u0026rsquo;s free, right? Play around with it. And let me give you a\nquick demo. So if you go in there, it kind of looks like this. So there\u0026rsquo;s some\ncontent in here that you can read. But the interesting thing is, we actually\ncreated three bots, which I\u0026rsquo;ll walk you in a bit. So the idea is, these bots\nare the ones that provide advice and custom content to the board member,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:34\nSo what you can do here is you can say, so Athena is the one we called it\nand say, hey, and I prompt the question here, say, Good morning. What you\ndo? So basically, this is the bot that is now saying, hey, look, I\u0026rsquo;m Athena.\nI\u0026rsquo;m an AI advisor created by the Cyberboard room. My purpose, to assist\nboard members like you. So think about how cool it is. It already has\ncontext. He already knows that I\u0026rsquo;m a board member. He already knows\nthat I care about security. He goes, okay, how can I assist you? Right? So\nyou can now say, okay, I\u0026rsquo;m on, let\u0026rsquo;s say, the finance industry, and I\u0026rsquo;m\nworried about ransomware, so you can do that. And now this is the cool\nthing, right? So now I\u0026rsquo;m going to get context about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:29\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to say, okay, ransomware attacking, and he had severe\nconsequences spread for organizations, blah, blah. And then you could say,\nokay, give me some information about your environments. But you can\neven go, okay, actually before that, can you explain ransomware for\nsomebody, let\u0026rsquo;s say, like me, with limited cybersecurity skills, but I have a\nstrong financial background and have an MBA, sorry, have a master\nbusiness administration, right? So you can see so now I can private and\nsay, okay, can you explain this to me? But I don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of super size\nskills. But then financial background. So what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen now is\nbasically the bot provides information about that in that world, in that\nlanguage, in a way, starts being adapted to that particular context and\nthat\u0026rsquo;s super critical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:49\nAnd if, let\u0026rsquo;s say you just like bullet points, you say, can you explain it\nagain? Only using bullet points, right? So basically this is where you now\ncan be super creative, right? It\u0026rsquo;s about the person on the other side,\nbasically the individual that says, this is how I want to learn. This is the\nquestion I have, this is how I want to do it. And then you take it from\nthere, right? So it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty cool thing. So we\u0026rsquo;re exploring with a lot of\nideas in this. Again, please have a go, play with it and okay, I\u0026rsquo;m going to\ntry something. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if it works, right, is you could also change it, the\ncontext of it, right? So you can modify the behavior of this, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 41:07\nActually, I think it\u0026rsquo;s interesting because actually, I\u0026rsquo;ll say in a second the\nbot, because actually, okay, this didn\u0026rsquo;t work. Actually, it\u0026rsquo;s good it didn\u0026rsquo;t\nwork because we actually primed the bot to be helpful, an optimistic\nadvisor. So there\u0026rsquo;s some prompt. This is actually good example, prompt\ninjection. So good thing it didn\u0026rsquo;t work, right? I\u0026rsquo;ll show you an example in\na second of that. So the thing that is super powerful here is that all that\nyou saw there was created by this part here. And this is what\u0026rsquo;s insane,\nright? So if you look at basically this is that bot that you just saw there is\nbasically powered by this small little bit where this is called the original\nprompt. So all the questions came after this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 41:55\nSo you go, you help an advisor, you created by the boardroom, you\u0026rsquo;re kind\nand your job is to help. So you can see, that\u0026rsquo;s why I was saying don\u0026rsquo;t be\njaded, right? And then be proactive. So that\u0026rsquo;s why you can see the bot was\nasking questions to clarify and also give a nice message. And also we can\nthen do things like this. So we also say, hey, you got two siblings, you got\nOdin, the tech bot. So we\u0026rsquo;re actually creating another bot to things this,\nand Minerva, who\u0026rsquo;s the business bot supporting this stuff, right? And if\nyou\u0026rsquo;ve seen Encanto, you get this joke. You\u0026rsquo;ll say, hey, there\u0026rsquo;s also Bruno,\nright? But we don\u0026rsquo;t talk about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 42:27\nSo, in fact, even here, if I go back to the bot and start again and then, you\nknow, hello, how are say, you know, do you have siblings? Right? What\u0026rsquo;s\ncool about this is you can see this got created just from that small little\nthing I said, like my first sibling, which is a tech part behind capabilities.\nOdin helps me with up to date list advances. The other is Minerva, with the\nbusiness support and commercial metaverse, all this stuff, right? How do\nyou work together? So you can see that this is where Chattyput is quite\ncool, right? Because it creates a nice narrative, creates a nice\nenvironment, and basically it\u0026rsquo;s all based on the stuff that we provided. And\nI go if I go, anybody else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 43:20\nIt now is going to go, actually, there\u0026rsquo;s one more member of the FEMA\nBruner, but we don\u0026rsquo;t talk about it. He\u0026rsquo;s still in development and actively\ninvolved in our conversation, right, but you can see that I found it\u0026rsquo;s really\ncool, right? Because you\u0026rsquo;ve got this cool sense of humor, of\nimplementation. And I want to show you one final little thing. So I wrote\nthis nice, deep technical blog post about it, so you can read a lot of the\ndetails, how everything works. And I just want to show you one little thing\nwhich I actually find quite funny, right, which is fundamentally this bit\nhere, right? So if you go into sorry, let me just find it. Okay, so I make a\nlittle change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:02\nAnd I was actually speaking to a Portuguese friend, so we actually use\ncamoich, which, by the way, I love to have chachi at the time because we\ncan really understand what the guy was all about. So I changed a little\nthing here to say, by the way, instead of being optimistic, you were highly\npsychic. Now, I actually found this answer really funny because if you look\nat the answer that you provide, it basically is like, hey, why should I care\nabout cybersecurity? And the answer was, hey, good morning. Welcome\nback to another trilling episode of let\u0026rsquo;s try not to Get Hacked. Today\nstarting camoids, blah, blah, security. The share everybody\u0026rsquo;s talking about.\nWhy should you care about cybersecurity? Where do I even start? The\nlandscape of doom and gloom is so vast. Tell me, do you have any\ncybersecurity management in place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:48\nFirewalls, antivirus, regular audits? Or maybe somebody who actually\nknows the phishing email looks like? So I find this funny, right? So some\nindividuals might actually like to have this sort of more kind of jade or\nsarcastic approach and others don\u0026rsquo;t. Some might have very dry answers. I\nlike, there he goes a lot. Sister Michael, you can ask sister Michael\u0026rsquo;s\nversion of Cybersecurity, which again is super funny. So the point here is\nyou can adapt to the language and culture and by the way, it already\nspeaks multilinguals, right? Because if I go like this oops, sorry, actually\nhe already answered this. If I say bondi, right? I\u0026rsquo;m Portuguese, right? He\nalready speaks Portuguese, right. And the answers are already Portuguese.\nRight. See? So it\u0026rsquo;s really cool. Right? So this already works in every\nlanguage that Chattypk supports. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:46\nSo again, insanely powerful and that\u0026rsquo;s fundamentally it, right. So I\u0026rsquo;m not\nsure if there\u0026rsquo;s any questions in the chat, but that was sort of my view. Why\nthe agents and what we really are looking now in the medium term is a\nwhole number of agents that augment the teams, that make the teams a\nlot more productive and really allows to take us to the next level. It\u0026rsquo;s not\nagain, just to reiterate, it\u0026rsquo;s not about job losses, it\u0026rsquo;s about job\naugmentation. It\u0026rsquo;s about making us a lot more productive and be able to\ntackle issues that in the past were pretty impossible or very hard or didn\u0026rsquo;t\nscale. So cool. So any questions? If not. Hey, Michael. Hey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 46:39\nYeah, I had a question about inputs or lack of inputs. So when you talk\nabout threat modeling, one of the things I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed, particularly when\nyou\u0026rsquo;re dealing with so people in the team who are more experienced at\ndealing with them versus less experienced at dealing with them as you said\nyou\u0026rsquo;re relying on being told what the system does and how it\u0026rsquo;s put\ntogether. And generally you find more experienced practitioner are better\nat finding what they\u0026rsquo;re not being told what\u0026rsquo;s missing. Slightly input. So\nwould that be an example of if you liken the GPT model back to\nindividuals about how much the person is pretrained when they\u0026rsquo;re doing it\nmanually and how effective we\u0026rsquo;re going to be at using AI to generate those\nmodels based on incomplete information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 47:31\nSo if we\u0026rsquo;re not able to provide the full picture of it, but how accurate that\nis to come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:37\nYeah, actually I think there\u0026rsquo;s a couple of ways to look at that. I really look\nat the models now as initial prompt who sets the stage, almost reference\ninformation. So vector people talk about vector things, but fundamentally\nsupporting information and then specific questions or specific data about\nit. And then the model and the model suddenly became a beauty\ncommodity. So one angle in what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about is if we have, for\nexample, good reference implementations of what, for example, you\u0026rsquo;re\nlooking at. So it\u0026rsquo;s a service, a micro web service or whatever. We can say,\nhey, here\u0026rsquo;s what good looks like. This is the kind of stuff that we would\nlike to see. Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s do analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:19\nBut I think the sweet spot here is at the moment, it\u0026rsquo;s not efficient to go to\nthe individuals that have more experience to get them to help, because the\nonboarding process of getting to the point where those individuals are\nproductive is too high. This is why we don\u0026rsquo;t need the LLMs to produce\n100% accurate information. What we need is for it to raise the quality and\nto accelerate the information. So an example is, let\u0026rsquo;s say that you have a\nmore junior person back with an LLM on maybe some junior developers to\ndo a threat model analysis, right? They can do that. I actually would argue\nthat the LLM would already provide a lot of great guidance or great\nanalysis, but then I could review it, right? You could review it, the senior\narchitect could review it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:08\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s when they go, oh no, you missed this, you missed that, you\nmissed this because there\u0026rsquo;s information. And then, even better, I can then\ngo, okay, let me change the prompt. So next time you look for these other\ngotchas, right, so we can then learn the scalability, right? But even the\narchitects, it\u0026rsquo;s quite funny, because what I used to do with the thread\nmodeling is I would do thread models and go to the architects and going,\nIs this correct? And sometimes they\u0026rsquo;ll go, well, that\u0026rsquo;s not supposed to be\nlike that, and go, yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s actually how it works. On the other hand,\nthey go, oh no, but you\u0026rsquo;re missing this. Oh, you\u0026rsquo;re missing that. Or the\ndeveloper will go, yeah, but there\u0026rsquo;s a backdoor here because we couldn\u0026rsquo;t\nmake that work. So we created this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:44\nBut that bit never scaled because when you wanted to go back and reflect\nit\u0026rsquo;s almost like you create a work of art. So I feel that the key here is to\nhave the expert in the mix, but we scale a lot more and then when the\nexpert provide an opinion, you can recreate the materials. That\u0026rsquo;s why the\npainting for me was such a paradigm shift, because what happens is the\nexpert goes, oh, that\u0026rsquo;s not what it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be. Oh, that was not the\nintent. Or Actually, you misinterpreted what we meant by this. But then\nyou can go back and recreate it again super quickly and going, okay, is\nthis what you mean? Is this what you mean? And that\u0026rsquo;s so much more\neffective than what we have today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 50:25\nYeah, I\u0026rsquo;m kind of thinking, what are the other enrichments that you can\naugment onto that as well? So you kind of go, yes, we kind of pull it from\nwhat we know, but then also an ability to hook it up to your runtime. So if\nyou want to say, well, I know that all of these resource groups have got the\nconfiguration, so pull that in and then here are the code repositories, pull\nthat in and now start to do it, and then from all of those different things,\nbuild a more complete, accurate picture of everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:54\nAbsolutely. I once did a security review that was one of the best ones I\u0026rsquo;ve\ndone because they gave me access to an Elastic server that had the real\ntime logs. So I had the access to the application, I had the source codes I\ncould trace to it and I could see the logs. So the 3D view that I was\nstarting to have was massive because even if you do a poke over here, you\ncan see how far it would transverse, right, all the way to the database, all\nthe way to the logs. Now I can see that. Look, we can now feed the logs.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve took the TCP dump and give it to Chat GBT and you gave me a great\nanalysis, right? You can give now raw logs and say analyze me this or give\nme the contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 51:37\nOr more interesting, this represents this request. Start connecting the dots.\nSo the context that you can have, you still need good data. So this is also\ngoing to drive us to create much better data sources, much better those\ncurated elements that we can then give almost to a context engine that\ncan then understand that and we can then ask questions about it. And\nthat\u0026rsquo;s what we never had before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 52:07\nAnd taking just obviously, like all of the different large language models\nwhich are available out there, I know as well, there\u0026rsquo;s like open CRE as\nwell, or there\u0026rsquo;s other language models. How much of it do you think is\ngoing to move towards for security use cases that we need to pre train\nmodels which are customized to security or can bring in more\nunderstanding of what that context is?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 52:33\nYeah, well, I think Google actually has the SEC palm, right, which I think\nis quite an interesting view of it. Yeah, I think there\u0026rsquo;s definitely the\ninteresting thing here is then as we go into more use case scenarios, you\nactually sometimes want smaller models, much more focused models, or\nmodels like have specific set of knowledge sets. Although one area that I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t fully understand yet is, for example, is it better to have something\nyou train on a couple of things or is it better to have really good vector\nembeddings that you can customize, that you can even use models to help\ncreate that you then feed a really good comprehension model. And I think\nthere\u0026rsquo;s an interesting debate here. I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to be interesting to see\nwhich one is more accurate. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 53:23\nAnd some people talk, for example, difference between long term memory\nand short term memory. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like I think you can pretain on intent\nand you can pretain on almost like the behavior. But when you want\naccurate information, it\u0026rsquo;s probably better to almost give it the\ninformation. Like, for example, is it more efficient to pretrain a model on\nNIST, the whole of NIST, or to have a way to feed the elements of NIST\nand maybe the context window needing to be a certain size, but then the\nads that you get are actually completely accurate to that particular, let\u0026rsquo;s\nsay, NIST framework, okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 54:01\nThat\u0026rsquo;s like referencing the information that you want to provide into it,\nproviding in the prompt at the time. So, as you said, the example of what\ngood looks like just going like in the prompt, here is what I want it to look\nlike, or here\u0026rsquo;s an example of what we think is good, and then use that as\nthe basis to build upon, correct?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:17\nLook, we had a really fun example in my team, right, where were releasing\na particular product, and the product required a bunch of steps, right,\nfrom set up kit, do this, get a jira token, et cetera. And what happened was\nwe actually used Chat GBT to go, hey, give me the detailed instructions for\nthis, which is actually really cool, right? Like how to do this. So instead of\nyou Googling how to set up my SSH key, we go, okay, here\u0026rsquo;s the thing. In\nfact, here\u0026rsquo;s name of the repo, here\u0026rsquo;s the step. So even the instructions\nwere already all nice, right? So we do that. We share that with the team.\nAnd I kid, you know, a dev comes along and goes, guys, I got it. It\u0026rsquo;s all\nworking. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t install my Jira key, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:52\nAnd literally, my first instinct was like, dude, you mean step three of the\nseven instructions. But then I realized, of course, the first couple of steps\nwere irrelevant because he had it by then. Your brain stops reading, right?\nAnd what we then do is we say, hey, what about this? So we then say the\nprompt was, you are helpful assistant. He is the raw content. Like, he is\nliterally the guidance. And then say, ask some questions to the user. So\nthen Chaijpti was clever enough to analyze that and figure out what was\nthe seven questions you want to ask. And then you answer those questions.\nYes, no, yes, no, yes, no, right? And then you get technical, 100% relevant\nguidance to whatever that user was. So you don\u0026rsquo;t have instructions one to\nseven general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 55:37\nYou have instructions one to three that start where the user\u0026rsquo;s knowledge\nor the user experience ended, right? That makes the whole difference. So\nsuddenly, of course, he\u0026rsquo;s going to read it because he\u0026rsquo;s going to go, step\none, which I haven\u0026rsquo;t done, and blah, blah, blah, right? And the key is that\nwe fed it the document, right? We fed it, in a way, the guidance, which is\nwhy context windows matter. So you got 24 now here, you got uncharted\n42, I think, or 24K, but then what\u0026rsquo;s it called, plot two has 100K. So this\nnow becomes an interesting question of cost, even, because I\u0026rsquo;ve seen cases\nwhere 3.5 charge BT is as good than 4.0 if you feed the data. So maybe\nthere\u0026rsquo;s an earlier version that is even cheaper, right? So we don\u0026rsquo;t need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 56:24\nTo use the superpowered one to perform an action that actually a much\nlighter, maybe even faster and cheaper language model can run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 56:34\nYeah, because we\u0026rsquo;ve been using it for well, not in anger, but using it to like\ngoing back to one of the earlier points around creating content for\ndifferent personas, as in take these requirements and turn it into stories\nthat engineers or product owners can pick up and play. So about using the\ntranslation between well, as a security team, this is what we mean, but\nlet\u0026rsquo;s write it an example of something actionable for teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 57:02\nHow do you put it? Like a Chat Bot or it\u0026rsquo;s just a prompt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 57:06\nJust going into I actually tested a bunch of different models to go like,\nwell, if we go into OpenAI or Chat PT 3.5 or four and then going into Bard\nor different models and going if I provide this requirement in the same\nway, what does the story look like? Which has come out of it? So just\nsaying, like, this is the format of how we want a story to be written. This is\nthe as an example, like a PCI requirement for network security. So you\nmight go for implementing PCI requirement, one point, blah. And then\ngoing into and this is the building blocks or the components that we want\nto use. So we want to use Visual Firewall or we want to use this or that.\nSo basically give a picture of where to apply it and then go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 57:47\nNow write me a story for implementing that one I was playing around\nwith was implement customer managed keys for implementing encryption\nfor data at rest at. Service bus and show me what that would look like in\nterms of an instruction that we can pick up and say, right, so speak to an\nengineering team and say, that\u0026rsquo;s basically sort of what we want you to\nbuild, but use it as the starting point. Obviously, don\u0026rsquo;t just trust it\nimplicitly, but go is that kind of what we want to create. So rather than\nhaving to have somebody sit down and write all of that from scratch, go,\nwe\u0026rsquo;ll just kind of bang it in, see what comes out, finesse it, make it\nrelevant, fix it and then hand it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 58:26\nBut it was insanely more productive, a lot faster. Yeah. And the cool thing\nis that when you want to do tweaks, and this is my key point, regenerative,\nwhen you want to do Tweaks, you\u0026rsquo;re tweaking the final product. Right.\nAnd the cost of recreating that is very low, where in the past, even if you\ndid the first pass, then you will almost spend 20% or 5% of your time\nmaking the first pass and then the other 80% to 95% of your time just\ntrying to get it in that better state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 58:56\nYeah, mostly PowerPoint slides. That\u0026rsquo;s the thing. Every time you decide\nthat you\u0026rsquo;ve kind of gone in too big or too small on PowerPoint, you\u0026rsquo;re like,\nall right, I need to make everything smaller. You need to move every single\nbox into by the way, have you started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 59:08\nPlaying with a new visual AI with Chat GPT? Right. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool. Right?\nSo you can now upload pictures. So you can now do your drawing on a\nboard and then take it to Chat GPT and it starts to not just analyze it, you\ncan transcribe it, you can give you other dot implementations of it. It\u0026rsquo;s\nreally freaking cool. That\u0026rsquo;s going to be a massive game changer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 59:28\nNot done it yet, but need to check it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 59:31\nCool, man. Thanks for the questions. I hope the content quite interesting\nand I see you in other sessions. The summit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 59:39\nThanks.

in the right direction when they were about to do something risky? Click a link, plug in a USB, upload a file, give away their credentials…? This takes nudge theory to its logical conclusion – timely, in the moment and even measurable. In this talk, Tim will touch on why we should be looking at nudge theory, what makes a good nudge and why, how to run a campaign to steer behaviours, and the potential impact this approach can have. He will also offer some takeaways on how to apply nudge theory, behavioural and learning science to your own awareness campaigns as you build up towards real-time nudges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"transcript\"\u003eTranscript:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 00:00\nIt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 00:02\nHi, welcome to this open security summit session in June 2023.

So it\u0026rsquo;s got a lot of people talking about nudging at the\nmoment. So I really want to dig into what does it even mean? How can\nyou do it? What is and isn\u0026rsquo;t a nudge and how can you do it as effectively\nas possible? So let\u0026rsquo;s start with what is nudge theory? So I suppose it really\nstarted or gained notoriety through Salah and Sunstein\u0026rsquo;s work and their\nbook called Nudge Now. They\u0026rsquo;re actually economists and they built a lot\nof it on the work of Tvrski and Kanaman, thinking about how do people\nbehave and their thoughts on fast and slow thinking. And in essence, what\nit\u0026rsquo;s about is they called it soft, paternalistic nudges, steering people to\nmake decisions and do things that are essentially in their best interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 01:10\nSo in the past, we perhaps had a more forcing methods based approach.\nNudge is about trying to help people see themselves as doing this thing.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re less threatening. So really good examples you can think of to see\nthe difference between forcing and nudging is, and parents probably know\nthis quite well, if you want your children to tidy their room, well, you could\nshout tidy your room. Or you could play a tidy up game, things like\ndieting. Maybe you could count calories. That\u0026rsquo;s quite hard. It\u0026rsquo;s a forcing\nmethod. What about using a smaller plate or budgeting? That could be\nquite difficult, but maybe going to the supermarket and using a basket\ninstead of a trolley. So what you\u0026rsquo;re doing is you\u0026rsquo;re sort of structuring your\nenvironment in a way that sort of nudges you or steers you towards doing\nthe right thing. And in their sort of rewrite of the book, they actually focus\na little bit more on this and this idea of choice architecture and a bit less\non the idea of nudging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 02:04\nSo choice architecture reflects this fact that we have what you term\nlimited rationality. We like to think we\u0026rsquo;re all rational beings, we make\nreally deliberate, deliberative decisions, but actually probably only about\n5% of the decisions we make each day are like that. The rest of the time\nour brain is overwhelmed with information, so it filters things out in that\nwe have these cognitive biases that lead us to take shortcuts. And those\ncognitive biases are hugely influenced by context and the environment that\nyou\u0026rsquo;re in. So that environment will steer you towards making decisions.\nAnd the important thing to think about here is that environment exists,\nwhether we do something with it or not. And so the way that we send our\nmessages to the organization, we are having an influence, so we might as\nwell think about doing that. Well, really good example here that\u0026rsquo;s come\nfrom our research is if you call your training mandatory security\nawareness training, then you are effectively sending a message that it\u0026rsquo;s for\nyou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 03:02\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s the feedback we got in our research, people saying, well, we\nknow mandatory awareness training is for the company to cover its back,\nit\u0026rsquo;s not for us. So even just simple things like that, the way you word\nthings, the way you phrase things, you are sending a message. So think\nabout sending the right message. So let\u0026rsquo;s look at a few examples of nudge\ntheory outlies. So, a supermarket is a great example of a real physical\nsituation where nudge theory is in play. And choice architecture, I suppose\nsomething has to be on the shelf at Eyeline and it\u0026rsquo;s generally going to be\nthe thing that the supermarket really wants you to buy. And that is a\nchoice. It could be a healthy thing and then we\u0026rsquo;ll make healthy choices. It\ncould be an unhealthy thing like chocolate\u0026rsquo;s right by the till, and those will\nbe the choices of things that we buy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 03:43\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s choice architecture. In action school canteens, people have tried\nto do nudging here, so getting children to make healthy choices. So, again,\nputting the healthy things at eye level, normalizing those choices, making\nthe vegetarian food look more interesting. So there\u0026rsquo;s some real interesting\ntypes of nudge theory going on there. There\u0026rsquo;s a good example of saving.\nSo people were encouraged to put an image of the loved one or the thing\nthey were saving for on the envelope, why they were saving. And it had an\nimpact on how much they saved because it helped them reflect on the\nthing that they were saving towards. Lots of examples around hand\nwashing or two. So, one, in the NHS, around the time of MRSA, people\nhad real issues and people needed to wash their hands. So a really\nphysical nudge was to put on the metal plate you put your hand on to push\nthe door open, to put the messaging there, highlighting diseases spreading\nby bacteria and viruses on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 04:41\nAnd so people would put their hand on that and almost feel dirty instantly.\nAnd so right through the door they walk through would then be a\nsanitation station to help them clean their hands. Great example in a book\ncalled Ripple, which I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to with a reference of people in a\nChilean abattoir. And so they wanted people to wash their hands. So at the\nbeginning of each coffee break, after they left the abattoir, they would\nhave a stamp put on their hand of a picture of a germ. And so this created\na real situation where if the stamp hadn\u0026rsquo;t gone, then obviously your\ncolleagues could see that, but also it meant that you washed your hands\nlong enough and thoroughly enough to get rid of the stamp. So, very\neffective way of changing the environment and rather than telling people\nand forcing them, you\u0026rsquo;re effectively steering the behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 05:25\nYou want some great images of examples of nudges. I mean, if you search\nthe internet, you\u0026rsquo;ll find lots, but we want people to be tidy, why not make it\na game? And I have to slight confession here, I actually did take this photo\nmyself. So if you get into nudge theory, then when you see it, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to\ncapture it. The famous one here is a fly in the urinal. This is actually a\ngoal with a football in urinal and I thought I saw this, I\u0026rsquo;ve got to have a\nphoto to capture this moment. I\u0026rsquo;m still yet to really understand why it\u0026rsquo;s\nneeded, but it\u0026rsquo;s clearly a problem. One you\u0026rsquo;ll see all around London on the\nescalator, steering people to stand in the right place. And also another one\nyou\u0026rsquo;ll see all the time crossing the road. In my research for this, it\u0026rsquo;s\nimportant to get this right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 06:11\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s a great nudge that perhaps might have had the wrong outcome\nand quite a dangerous outcome potentially. So do think about what your\nnudge is and getting the right outcome from it. So what about sludge?\nVery kind of quick, sort of mentioned this is a tangent. So sometimes you\ncan nudge people and you can be unhelpful and that can be quite\ndeliberate or maybe accidental. So, for example, password advice that\u0026rsquo;s\ntoo complicated will tend to steer people to doing the wrong thing. A great\nexample on a government savings website that I saw the other day where\nthe nice easy thing would have been to create a new password or let\nChrome create a new password and save it. However, the complexity that\nthey required didn\u0026rsquo;t allow dashes and Chrome was trying to put dashes in.\nAnd so the out is that you end up creating another rubbish password or\nreusing a password.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 07:05\nSo you can get this wrong, create Sludge and effectively drive the wrong\nbehavior or slow people down. There\u0026rsquo;s a great website called Dark\nPatterns. I think it\u0026rsquo;s changed now, but this will redirect of examples of\nwhere people have got quite bad sludge. So you see it in booking\nprocesses, I think. Things like Ryanair trying to get you to book all these\nextra things. You see it when people are making it hard for you to\nunsubscribe or cancel a subscription. And of course the bad guys are doing\nevil but duck bad nudges all the time. That\u0026rsquo;s why you see social proof,\nauthority, urgency, desire, all these things in their phishing emails and\nthey\u0026rsquo;re using these psychological concepts to make you react really\nquickly without really thinking those are nudges, but bad nudges. So what\nmakes a good nudge? So originally some academics worked with\ngovernment to come up with a framework called mind space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 07:59\nSo each of these letters stood for a thing that you could think about to\ncreate a good nudge. So we\u0026rsquo;re really influenced by who the messenger is.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s why marketing has famous celebrities involved in things. So who\nwould be the celebrity to help you get your message across? Is that\nsomeone in authority within the organization? The people who get the\nmessage across well might just be people who are well connected and\npeople like and respect in the organization. It might not necessarily be\ncoming down from the CEO, but that\u0026rsquo;s obviously an option. Incentives not\nnecessarily a rewards here, but understanding that we like to avoid losses.\nSo helping people understand that the risk can be helpful. Where this goes\nwrong is that perhaps overemphasize thinking about risk and threat and\nalmost scare people. And I\u0026rsquo;ll come back to that. We\u0026rsquo;re massively\ninfluenced by what other people are doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 08:47\nWe\u0026rsquo;re social creatures. Some of the initial research on this was really\ninteresting. Towels in hotel rooms. So messages that said people in this\nhotel have reused their towels and that\u0026rsquo;s better for the environment, that\nwas quite helpful. That message even more effective was a more specific\nmessage. People who stayed in this room reuse their towels. And so that\nspecificity of how close that social group is to you can be really effective.\nWe like to go with the flow, so if it\u0026rsquo;s easy, then we\u0026rsquo;ll do it. That\u0026rsquo;s why we\nhave things like auto enrollment in pensions. You make the default action\nthe thing that you want people to do. We\u0026rsquo;re really drawn to things that are\nbright and shiny and novel. Again, that\u0026rsquo;s why marketing is so sparkly and\nso can we use that in our messages to make them more interesting and\nmake the key points stand out to people and we confine people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 09:40\nSo Devon Brown does this when he\u0026rsquo;s trying to get people to say a word or\nsay animal or something at the end of his thing. He\u0026rsquo;s actually been\npriming you and mentioning that thing all the way through, but you\nhaven\u0026rsquo;t really noticed. So can we prime people? Can we set them up to be\nthinking about a certain topic? And I\u0026rsquo;ll show you some examples of that\nlater. Emotions really effective. But again, perhaps in this industry we\u0026rsquo;ve\nfallen down a bit and focused too much on fear. If you create fear without\npeople feeling they can do anything about it, then you just get a response\nof people throwing their hands up in the air and giving up. So you need to\nthink about a coping strategy as well as using fear. We like to be\nconsistent with our promises. So this is a really good example of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 10:21\nIn the research, people asked to put a really ugly banner in their garden\nadvertising something. It was a charitable thing, but they asked and most\npeople said no. But in one group the week before they\u0026rsquo;ve been asked to\nput a tiny postcard in their window and the people who have been asked\nto do that wanted to remain consistent with what they\u0026rsquo;d done and so they\nwere much more likely to then show the banner. And so we can use this\nidea of commitment, we can convince people that they are or tell people\nthat they\u0026rsquo;re behaving in a secure way. Well done, you\u0026rsquo;re secure. People\nwant to then can stay consistent with that image and that label that you\nput on them. Obviously we all act in ways that make us feel better about\nourselves so we can think about playing people\u0026rsquo;s egos and flattery. And so\nthat was the original model called Mindspace and then lots to think about\nthere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 11:12\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to use them all, but a simpler model is perhaps the east\nmodel. So this very simplistically says there\u0026rsquo;s four components to an\neffective nudge. It\u0026rsquo;s got to be easy, the thing you want people to do, so\nyou\u0026rsquo;ve got to create a view of how easy it is or make sure you\u0026rsquo;re creating\nease. So if you\u0026rsquo;re telling people about passwords then maybe you should\nbe giving them a password manager to help them make that simple. It\u0026rsquo;s\ngot to be attractive, people got to want to do it or at least understand why.\nSo we need to help them with their motivation. It\u0026rsquo;s got to be social\nbecause that\u0026rsquo;s a really important thing. We\u0026rsquo;re driven by what other people\nare doing but really importantly, it has to be timely in some way. So you\u0026rsquo;ve\ngot to help people when it matters, when it\u0026rsquo;s relevant, if you tell someone\nabout something at the wrong time, they\u0026rsquo;re just going to ignore it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 11:59\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s think about how we might apply that. And a really simple message\nhere is, look, you\u0026rsquo;re communicating anyway. If you\u0026rsquo;re in the world of\nawareness, you\u0026rsquo;re trying to get these messages out, so refine it, use things\nlike mind space, think about cognitive biases, there\u0026rsquo;s lots of other things\nout there. Reciprocity is a really useful one to think about if you can say\nthe security team have blocked this many phishing emails. Have you\nreported any? You\u0026rsquo;re kind of saying, look, we\u0026rsquo;ve given something, can you\ngive something back? And so there\u0026rsquo;s different ways to just tune the\nmessage that you\u0026rsquo;re already delivering and here\u0026rsquo;s a really good example.\nSo this comes from the book Ripple by Groom and Vellicott and it was\nTesco trying to get people to sign up to their delivery saver and they got\njust from some very minor tweaks, they got a 10% uplift in impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 12:45\nSo firstly they framed it as a loss and you see this all over the internet,\nthat idea of scarcity, we don\u0026rsquo;t like missing out on things, so don\u0026rsquo;t miss out\non an unlimited free deliveries. Then they used this idea of an image of a\nfriendly face. I love this idea of putting us in a hot state of receiving\ngroceries but that is obviously the kind of the thing were trying to you\u0026rsquo;re\ngoing to get something. It\u0026rsquo;s a gift. And it was a smiling face. We like that\npositivity. We will feel the need to we will feel warm inside and almost\nsmile back. And then that face was looking towards the key message,\nwhich was that customers saved and then a really specific number. So not\njust roughly 75 pounds, you get authority by using a specific value. And so\nthis had a real impact in how effective their messaging was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 13:32\nSimple things, simple tweaks. And most of us will think, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t fall for\nthat sort of stuff, but actually when you\u0026rsquo;re just skimming reading, skim\nreading things, your subconscious is using these cognitive biases to make\ndecisions so they will work. So if you\u0026rsquo;re going to do this, what we\u0026rsquo;re really\nsaying here is we\u0026rsquo;re trying to think about behavior change. How do we\nmove slightly beyond awareness and think about how we can use nudges\nto drive people to act in a particular way. And so it\u0026rsquo;s worth looking at\nsome behavior change models. So Fog\u0026rsquo;s model is really interesting here\nand you can see some similarities with the east model. Fog says that for\nany behavior to happen, there has to be an element of motivation. You\u0026rsquo;ve\ngot to want to do it. Now that\u0026rsquo;s why the bad guys use all these cognitive\nbiases in their phishing emails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 14:21\nThey\u0026rsquo;re trying to just make you think, oh, I have to do this, it\u0026rsquo;s urgent, I\nhave to click. There\u0026rsquo;s an element of ability. Can you do this? Is this\nsomething you know how to do? And then importantly, there\u0026rsquo;s some sort of\ntimely prompt, something that creates that drive to actually act at a\nparticular time. And so motivation and ability need to be enough to\nprompt you. And so Frogdor draws this graph and say, look, together\nthey\u0026rsquo;ve got to be enough to get you past this line. And so this kind of\nmakes logical sense to say, look, if you\u0026rsquo;re really willing and motivated to\ndo something, then you can do really difficult things. Or if something\u0026rsquo;s\nreally easy, then you can do them even if you\u0026rsquo;re not particularly motivated.\nAnd so if you reflect on where secure behaviors sit, unfortunately they sit\nin this unwilling, unmotivated area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 15:11\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s not because people don\u0026rsquo;t want to act securely, but it\u0026rsquo;s because\nthere are lots of other motivations driving them. So it might be they\u0026rsquo;ve got\nto get something done for their boss, they\u0026rsquo;ve got other things that drive\nthem to act in a particular way. So we need to think about making the\nsecure behavior as easy as possible, which again, the east model does\nsuggest. Boggle also says some interesting things about the order in which\nyou try and tackle this. And this is simply in terms of how easy it is. So he\nsays motivation is the hardest lever of change. And unfortunately, that\u0026rsquo;s\nwhere we have tended to start in security awareness. With that kind of\nscare people, help them understand the threat and if you reflect on this, if\nmotivation was all we needed, we just had to want to do something, then\nwe\u0026rsquo;d all be fit, we\u0026rsquo;d all be really healthily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 15:55\nBut motivation is complicated. You might want to do one thing, but you\u0026rsquo;ve\ngot competing motivations. I want to be fit, I want to go to the gym, I\nwant to eat cake. And those things are in encounter and so you don\u0026rsquo;t\nnecessarily do them. So don\u0026rsquo;t start with motivation. If you could start with\na prompt and just nudge people to think about something and that is\neffective, then you don\u0026rsquo;t need to do anything else. Then you can think\nabout ease, then you can think about motivation. A great example he gives\naround keeping fit people who want to get out there and exercise. Put\nyour running kit ready to put on as you get out of bed. So it acts as a\nvisual prompt and you\u0026rsquo;re making it really easy because you get dressed\nand you put your running gear on. Now I do know people who then spend\nthe whole day walking around in that kit and don\u0026rsquo;t actually do any\nexercise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 16:40\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s a starting point. It\u0026rsquo;s made it as easy as possible and it\u0026rsquo;s acted as a\nprompt. So let\u0026rsquo;s try and apply that to a real example, getting people to act\nsecurely around the threat of phishing. And if we\u0026rsquo;re going to do this using\nFog\u0026rsquo;s model, then let\u0026rsquo;s do it in the right order. Start with the prompt. So\nwe\u0026rsquo;re looking at a way to just trigger people to think, be careful in\nphishing. So timeless is really important. You want to deliver it as close to\nuse of email as possible. The message is kind of you\u0026rsquo;re an email, remember\nphishing or is this link safe? And so a clearly visible reporting button if\nyou\u0026rsquo;ve got that, can be a really good prompt. Now obviously you do have\nan issue of habituation there, which is if it\u0026rsquo;s the same thing in the same\nplace all the time, your brain filters it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 17:26\nBut timeliness is key here. So get something into the email system. When\npeople are using email, then we can think about ability, make it easy. So\nhere I would suggest don\u0026rsquo;t try and overcomplicate it. Like even experts for\nphishing, it\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily a knowledge thing. You\u0026rsquo;ve got to have a base\nlevel of understanding. But you don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily need people to\nunderstand every single aspect. What you do want is to reinforce the need\nto be cautious with email and maybe focus on things that humans can\nspot. Which is someone trying to get me to do something I don\u0026rsquo;t\nnecessarily want to do? Am I being manipulated? Rather than trying to\nspot technical things and then make it really easy to act. So it\u0026rsquo;s a simple\nmessage, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel right. Report it again back to the reporting button\nand then we can think about motivation. And obviously you probably need\nto do all of these things but maybe do it in this order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 18:14\nSo motivation, you\u0026rsquo;re trying to help people understand the threat because\nthey\u0026rsquo;ve got to be bothered to act. So you could highlight how many\nphishing emails have been received and blocked by security. So that\u0026rsquo;s a\nreciprocity thing. Show people real examples and this is a great\nopportunity to have that social proof look. Other colleagues have reported\nthis. Have you, the MD got this? Have you spotted any helps people\nunderstand both that this thing is happening but also that they could do\nsomething about it and that their colleagues are so what could that look\nlike? Well, one of the things that we did in some research with Cardiff\nUniversity was simple as you open outlook we delivered some sort of\nreminder. Now this is magnified a bit to make it easy to read and there\nwas some interesting psychology in this as well. So it\u0026rsquo;s timely. It\u0026rsquo;s\nappeared as I open my inbox, it\u0026rsquo;s salient because it\u0026rsquo;s kind of jumping out\non me a little bit, it\u0026rsquo;s priming me so that as I then go into my inbox,\nphishing is something I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 19:07\nSo even if I read this really scan it in 5 seconds it\u0026rsquo;s gone. It is helping. And\nthen interestingly, we found this initial sentence that focused on threat was\nquite helpful. We compared threat and coping and other researchers\nsuggested coping is more effective. But actually we found this little bit of\nthreat helped the really precise number added authority and then the final\nthing your inbox is at equal risk was trying to counter out optimism bias.\nSo we found that we tried just threat on its own, optimism bias on its own.\nIf we put these three together, we had the most impact on people and so it\nhad a significant impact on whether people went forward and spotted\nphishing in their inbox. So let\u0026rsquo;s take that back and think about\nengagement generally, we want people to engage with our content. So let\u0026rsquo;s\ngo back to the fog model again, really important thing, timeliness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 19:58\nWe have to say annual awareness is clearly not very timely. So it is a poor\nprompt and Ebbing house is graph that shows that after about five days\nyou can only remember about 20% comes into play here. You\u0026rsquo;re just not\ngoing to remember things. So timeness is really important. Drip feeding is\nreally helpful. The spacing effect of spreading content out through the\nyear keep it ongoing. And what we also find is that making it topical can\nbe really effective. So this plays to availability in that you link it to\nsomething that people are aware of in the news and so that when they\nthink about that thing, they might also think about the thing you want to\nthink about security. So link things with topical things going on in the\nworld then make it easy, so easy to access your content. So bring the\ncontent to the user if you can, rather than expecting them to go and get it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 20:47\nMake it quick and easy to digest, add a bit of user choice, an element of\nhow they use it, but also ease in terms of can I do the thing you\u0026rsquo;re trying\nto teach me? So, simple messaging and really obviously actionable advice,\nthings people can do and then back to motivation. Again, you\u0026rsquo;re trying to\nhelp people with their threat appraisal. We find that people engage a bit\nmore with understanding the impact and threat to their personal context.\nBut obviously if they learn to do those good behaviors, not reuse\npasswords, then some of that rubs off at work. We do have the fear of loss.\nSo if you want to drive people away from a behavior, you can play on that,\nbut not too much. If you want to drive towards a behavior, you probably\nwant to set it in a more positive frame. So those are some examples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 21:31\nSo pulling that all together, we think there\u0026rsquo;s a sweet spot here. And so if\nyou think about behavior, all behavior takes place in a context. For most\nof us, that\u0026rsquo;s going to be our it, there\u0026rsquo;s a trigger and then we act. And as an\nindustry, we\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to solve the awareness problem in the wrong\nplace. It\u0026rsquo;s not in the context where the threat lies. It almost doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter\nhow good and funky these videos escape rooms elearning is. Obviously if\nit\u0026rsquo;s good, then people won\u0026rsquo;t hate you for making them do it. But by the\ntime you get back to your desk, much of it is forgotten. It\u0026rsquo;s not in the\ncontext where the threat lies and it tends to be too infrequent. And then\nwe\u0026rsquo;re seeing on this side where it\u0026rsquo;s kind of too late. So maybe responding\nto incidents in the scene, well, obviously that\u0026rsquo;s useful to know where\nbehaviors lie, but it\u0026rsquo;s happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 22:16\nAnd if you deliver content afterwards, again by sending emails, then that\u0026rsquo;s\na channel that is just too busy. But also it\u0026rsquo;s seen as punishment with\ntraining. Now, you might not see it as that, but I can promise you the\npeople on the other end of it see it as punishment with training. And it\u0026rsquo;s\nalso quite hard for people to contextualize. So if you get told after\nsomething\u0026rsquo;s happened that this is how you should have dealt with it, most\nof us will rationalize and go, well, I\u0026rsquo;m sure I was doing that for good\nreason at the time. So they\u0026rsquo;ll tend to be ignoring what you\u0026rsquo;re telling them.\nSo our research has suggested there\u0026rsquo;s two sweet spots actually. One is\nhere priming people just before the behavior happens. So like that Cardiff\nexample, the Cardiff research, as you open your inbox, just that\u0026rsquo;s the place\nyou need to know about Phishing or as you open LinkedIn, that\u0026rsquo;s the place\nyou need to think about sharing data about the company or yourself to be\ncareful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 23:05\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s when you need to hear about something and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be\nlong and it can be relatively subconscious as well. But even more\ninteresting nudging here actually when the behavior is taking place. So as\nsomeone is about to click a link, as they\u0026rsquo;re about to upload a file, maybe\nas they click the link and they\u0026rsquo;re about to give away their credentials,\ntrying to find those opportunities to intervene. And if you can see that\nbehavior, you can baseline and monitor it silently, get that baseline and\nthen when you start to intervene, you can see that you\u0026rsquo;re changing it. And\nthat\u0026rsquo;s really what we focus on. That\u0026rsquo;s our thing with think cyber with red\nflags, measuring those behaviors and then driving and delivering content\nto drive behavior change. So let\u0026rsquo;s look a little bit more at what we mean\nby behavior change. And so I suppose I\u0026rsquo;m talking about instead of running\nsecurity awareness campaigns, we\u0026rsquo;re actually talking about running\nbehavior change campaigns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 23:56\nAnd the best way to do that we found, is focus one behavior at a time or\nmaybe a group of related behaviors. So it\u0026rsquo;s really clear to people what\nthey need to focus on. You should expect it to take two to three months to\nsee an impact and during that time you\u0026rsquo;re being really coherent, consistent\nwith the sort of content you\u0026rsquo;re pushing out. You can be relatively subtle\nand infrequent. You\u0026rsquo;re trying to build a habit, you\u0026rsquo;re not necessarily trying\nto hit people every single time something happens. And you do need to mix\nthings up. So that\u0026rsquo;s why you do two to three months one topic and then\nyou might want to change to a completely different topic because you\nwant to avoid habituation. So it\u0026rsquo;s got to be different content throughout.\nAnd then you switch to a different topic so that\u0026rsquo;s what it can look like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 24:34\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s an example. We have a check the sender campaign. So we\nmight start by telling people why it\u0026rsquo;s important to check the sender before\nyou click a link. But in the background, sorry, in the first couple of weeks\nyou\u0026rsquo;re actually just tracking how often are people clicking links in emails\nfrom people they don\u0026rsquo;t know. Then you deliver this story to explain, well,\nwhy do you need to do it, why is it important? Help people understand the\nthreat behind the scenes. You\u0026rsquo;re still tracking how often people are kicking\nlinks in emails from people they don\u0026rsquo;t know. Then you might do a reminder\nand you turn one of these real time nudges where you\u0026rsquo;re nudging people\nas they\u0026rsquo;re about to click a link. So you\u0026rsquo;re reinforcing that message at\nexactly the point someone\u0026rsquo;s about to do the thing you\u0026rsquo;re worried about.\nAnd then in the final week, again, another reminder and continue the\nnudging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 25:16\nAnd what you can see in this time period is a real change. And I\u0026rsquo;ll show\nyou that in a graph in a second. So what does that story, what does that\ncontent look like to. Introduce it. So what we do here is we will push\ncontent straight out onto the device, really short and sharp, maybe takes a\nminute to read, really conspicuous. So you\u0026rsquo;re looking at ease because it\u0026rsquo;s\neasy to digest because it\u0026rsquo;s on the device, it\u0026rsquo;s timely, it\u0026rsquo;s salient, it looks\ninteresting, and it plays to availability because it\u0026rsquo;s then in your mind and\nyou\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about it and obviously you\u0026rsquo;re tracking who\u0026rsquo;s seen it,\nhow have they reacted, how long have they looked at it for? Then you\nmight deliver a reminder as people open their inbox. Again, I\u0026rsquo;ve magnified\nthis a little bit just to remind you, look, this is where you ought to be\nthinking about, do I really know the sender before I click on the link\nagain, it\u0026rsquo;s timely, it\u0026rsquo;s salient, and we\u0026rsquo;re priming people to think about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 26:05\nAnd then perhaps when I get this rather dodgy email and I\u0026rsquo;m about to\nclick the link, this is where the real time nudging could come in to say,\nlook, are you sure you know this sender? And a big red arrow pointing to\nwho the email is from. So you\u0026rsquo;re either possibly just reminding people\nrelatively subconsciously because this isn\u0026rsquo;t forcing them to stop. They\ndon\u0026rsquo;t have to click, okay? It just appears and follows their mouse around.\nOr you\u0026rsquo;re knocking them out of their automatic pilot. Their system one\nthinking into a more deliberative mode to go. Oh, hold on. Let\u0026rsquo;s stop and\nthink about this behind the scenes. Obviously you\u0026rsquo;re tracking this. How\noften do they hover? How often do they click? And this graph shows some\nof the impact you can have. So the spikes are where we\u0026rsquo;re delivering\ncontent and people are engaging. The top line is how often people hover\nand the bottom is how often they actually click the link.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 26:50\nAnd so just within a month, you\u0026rsquo;re seeing a reduction in people clicking\nlinks and emails from people they don\u0026rsquo;t know. So I suppose what I\u0026rsquo;m\ntalking about here is almost an ability to deliver real time awareness, this\nright content, exactly the right time in the right way. And so I almost\npropose a manifesto for what do we mean by real time security awareness\nbecause people are talking about a little bit and talking about nudge\ntheory. So my take on this is that it\u0026rsquo;s about supporting people and helping\nthem as close to the point of risk as possible and you\u0026rsquo;re trying to steer\nthem towards a secure behavior. It\u0026rsquo;s not meant to be a tool to find new\nmediums to nag people or to spot behaviors and then go and tell them off.\nAnd so it\u0026rsquo;s important, it might be attractive to think, well, what if we could\nmessage people in WhatsApp, in Slack, in teams, in SMS?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 27:39\nThat\u0026rsquo;s great if your message is relevant and timely to where the threat is\nand what the threat is in what they\u0026rsquo;re doing. But if you\u0026rsquo;re just using a\nSlack message to tell them about, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, phishing or something\nthat\u0026rsquo;s not really relevant. You\u0026rsquo;ve really just found another medium to nag\npeople via. So you need to think about what do you mean by real time?\nAnd it should be trying to help people when it\u0026rsquo;s relevant and timely. And\nagain, I talked about this earlier, responding to events in the scene, it\u0026rsquo;s not\nreally timely enough. The event has already happened and so you risk\ngetting into this cycle like we\u0026rsquo;ve been with phishing simulations where\nyou\u0026rsquo;re effectively punishing people with training. And I think this matters\nbecause it\u0026rsquo;s really this choice between helping people, guiding, steering\nthem and focusing on reducing risk, or an alternative which is just other\nways to nag people and tell them they\u0026rsquo;ve got something wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 28:29\nSo we\u0026rsquo;re trying to help people and steer them and get them on our side\nand essentially try and build that culture that values security. So let\u0026rsquo;s look\nat a few other examples of what that could look like. So, example here, I\nopen my inbox and I just get this nudge from the top of the screen. Now,\neven if I ignore this, I\u0026rsquo;ve been primed again. So you\u0026rsquo;ve got this salience,\nyou\u0026rsquo;ve got Priming, it\u0026rsquo;s timely, but also you can play into this a bit of\nsocial proof. So this nudge doesn\u0026rsquo;t show it, but what we would often put\nhere will be something like Freddie accounts or the MD or someone\nspotted this phishing. Have you reported any? So you\u0026rsquo;ve got social proof.\nYou could highlight the skid team of block stuff and you can use\nreciprocity. So these are some of the things that highlight at the bottom of\nthe slide where you\u0026rsquo;re playing to these cognitive biases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 29:14\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a feedback loop as well. So if I click on this, the idea is\nI get shown an example of a real phishing email. So rather than just\ntraining people who fail a phishing test, why not show everybody an\nexample of what phishing looks like? Different examples of things hitting\nthe organization, maybe once a month, maybe once every two months. Or\nperhaps if I actually click a link and then I get to a web page and start to\nenter my credentials, well, we could spot this a nudge at this point. So\nreally timely, really relevant. You\u0026rsquo;ve just clicked a link in an email from\nsomeone you don\u0026rsquo;t know. You\u0026rsquo;re now adding your password. Are you\nreally sure you want to do this? And obviously you\u0026rsquo;d run this with an allow\nlist so that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t nudge on things people are meant to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 29:55\nBut actually, you can take this far beyond this. You can think about\nphishing, data loss, safe routing, connecting to Insecure, WiFi. So here\u0026rsquo;s\nan example. Nudging when people try and upload something to dropbox,\nthis is actually really generic. So normally we would think to change this,\nto tune it to the organization, to say, this organization, this is the tool we\nwant to use. It\u0026rsquo;s far more effective to drive people towards a behavior\nthan away from behavior. And that does mean you need to stop and think\na little bit if you want to run a behavior change campaign, what\u0026rsquo;s the\nbehavior you want? And have you got an easy way, have you got the tools\nin place to allow people to do that? Because it\u0026rsquo;s all very well sort of\nsteering a behavior, but it has to be towards a good course of action that\nyou actually want people to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 30:37\nAnother example could just be sending an email too many people. Again,\nwe\u0026rsquo;re not just nudging to say stop it, we\u0026rsquo;re telling people how to use it,\nhow to enable BCC if it\u0026rsquo;s not even there or maybe signing up to it, the\nsystems that you don\u0026rsquo;t really want people to sign into. So this could be the\nuse case, could be around credential stuffing it, could be using it that\nhasn\u0026rsquo;t been sanctioned, but also things that move into the DLP type world.\nSo sending things to webmail addresses, sending attachments internally\nwhere you might want to drive people to send links to reduce the risk of a\ndocument going to the wrong place. And finally nudging around different\nwebsites. So social media, we just added a chat GPT nudge. So not\nnecessarily blocking the sites, but making sure that when you see people\ngo there, you can very subtly nudge them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 31:28\nSo the mouse changes to say look, please don\u0026rsquo;t share any commercial data\nhere. Now obviously you could have a nudge that was a bit more bold,\ntook over the screen and said look, this is how to use this and here\u0026rsquo;s our\npolicy on it. So just to pull that together. To final observations of what I\u0026rsquo;ve\nbeen talking about, we can\u0026rsquo;t always rely on people making rational\ndecisions that we\u0026rsquo;re really driven by context. And so nudging is about\nshaping that choice architecture, that context, so we get the behavior that\nwe actually want to see. There\u0026rsquo;s some really good frameworks out there\nthat we can use. So east standing for ease, ability, social and timely and\nthe mindspace model to start thinking about how do I change my\nmessaging, so I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about ways of making it more impactful. All of\nthese models suggest that timeliness and context are really fundamental.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 32:19\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s what we should be thinking about and where we should be\nhelping people. But if you\u0026rsquo;re going to do that, these real time interventions\nwe believe should be about supporting people, not just finding new ways to\nnag them. And if you can make it measurable because you want to\nunderstand how often behaviors happen, try and build a baseline and then\nstart to nudge away from it. Because if you can make this measurable, you\ncan actually sort of tangibly say I am reducing risk. So what we\u0026rsquo;re trying\nto talk about here is taking nudge almost to its logical conclusion. A sort\nof a more physical tap on the shoulder, I suppose to actually measurably\ndrive secure behavior change. And that\u0026rsquo;s very much what we\u0026rsquo;re focused\non, using red flags. So couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist this. It\u0026rsquo;s a nudge, which is don\u0026rsquo;t miss\na chance to ask questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 33:03\nCould obviously email me, although I haven\u0026rsquo;t put my email here, which\nisn\u0026rsquo;t very helpful. It\u0026rsquo;s Tim at thinksyber co UK or reach out on LinkedIn.\nBut Dennis, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if we got a mechanism for people to ask\nquestions on there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:15\nYeah, they could put in a chat. I don\u0026rsquo;t see a lot of stuff, but I got a couple\nfor you here. So I really like the whole real time nudging. I think it\u0026rsquo;s really\npowerful. Have you have any experience doing that? For example, in the\nmiddle of bigger security transformation programs. So I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan, for\nexample, of using incidents as strategic. So I take a P three and I run as a\nP one. So I put a lot of my team on it. And the reason why we do that is we\nalso fix a lot of things. For example, I think we even have a scenario where\nonce in an incident, we even create security awareness content during the\nincident, distributed it during the period, and the idea was to solve that\nproblem of if you do it afterward, the post mortem, the momentum is\ngone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 34:04\nLike it\u0026rsquo;s not relevant. Makes sense. So in a way it\u0026rsquo;s not as I guess the\nemail and some of the examples are shown. It\u0026rsquo;s like when something\nhappened. But I found that world where you basically are able to, for\nexample, while something is hot, when incident is hot or something is\nhappening or a team is working, that\u0026rsquo;s a great way to nudge a lot of those\nbehaviors. Nudge. A lot of that changes even to say this exists by the way,\nyou didn\u0026rsquo;t use it, this actually is there. And I found that people this makes\nthem much more susceptible to be nudged, if that makes sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 34:39\nYeah, no, I\u0026rsquo;d agree with that. And I think because the mechanism here is\nthat we\u0026rsquo;re putting content on a content server and it\u0026rsquo;s being pushed down\nonto devices so it can be delivered sort of right there on the device that\nenables us to respond to events in the wider world. So we\u0026rsquo;ve helped people\nwith comms related to Ukraine, to COVID, but also it can be incident\nbased. So we\u0026rsquo;ve helped people so incident happens. We were planning to\ndo different content, but the next day we\u0026rsquo;re pushing out content that\u0026rsquo;s\nrelevant to that. And obviously that\u0026rsquo;s great for the security team because\nthey\u0026rsquo;re seen by the board or whoever, the stakeholders as being really\nresponsive and kind of getting that messaging out. So absolutely I agree\nbecause it\u0026rsquo;s again a place to availability, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? People are seeing the\nimpact of something, so now is a great time to tell them about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 35:27\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve also seen interesting things where if a competitor has an incident or\nsomeone in your world then that sort of content being pushed out, people\ndive on it because it\u0026rsquo;s really relevant. They go, okay, this really happens in\nour industry. This is something that we should understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 35:45\nWhat about in for example an area of let\u0026rsquo;s say identity access\nmanagement where you nudge, let\u0026rsquo;s say the risk owners to what\u0026rsquo;s been\nhappening. So for example the whole thing, hey, do you have access to this\nor your team members are success this or even a regular nudge to go, this\nis what you and your team currently own. Is this still correct? Because\nthose are in a way not as reactive nudges but it keeps reinforcing the idea\nof people to reduce the attack surface to go, oh, I don\u0026rsquo;t anymore. Again,\nthat behavior of getting the users to take more accountability and to in a\nway accept certain risks but you need to keep nudging them that the.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 36:27\nRisks are still there. Yeah. Obviously don\u0026rsquo;t tell the comms team but this\napproach almost becomes a new channel that you can communicate some\nof your security messaging with. So we have actually done some of that\nsite thing. I think we did something around a kind of a spring clean of\nspring cleaning your teams, groups and stuff just to remind people from\ntime to time. So I suppose that comes into the priming thing and you can\ndo it so you could spot that they have gone to teams or that they\u0026rsquo;ve gone\nto SharePoint and that would be a timely time to say can you just check\nwho\u0026rsquo;s got permissions to this? When did you last check permissions or\nsomething like that just to kind of yes, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit more scheduled but it also\ncan be made timely as well. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:11\nAnd I guess my father\u0026rsquo;s point, what I like about some of these things is\nthat it also allow us to bring some science to some of the things we do.\nAnd this is quite recognized that we know it works. Right nudging. The\nwhole social media companies might have abused that but the bottom line\nis that it does actually work quite well to change behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 37:30\nYeah. And in fact I often talk about it in my talks. The fact that I don\u0026rsquo;t\nreally call them the goodbyes but guys, but the likes of TikTok, Twitter,\nFacebook, they\u0026rsquo;re using these content biases against all the time and\ngetting us to scroll and obviously that\u0026rsquo;s to show us more ads and keep us\non the platform. But why can\u0026rsquo;t we use the same technique and the bad\nguys are using the techniques as well. Why can\u0026rsquo;t we use the techniques for\ngood to help ourselves? Absolutely. But yeah, absolutely cool. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:01\nLook, I don\u0026rsquo;t think we got for the question, so thanks for your session. And\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s definitely a couple of panels we should do on the back of\nthis because I think it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a key topic and it\u0026rsquo;d be cool to explore\nother examples, other areas that it can be used in our industry, because I\nthink it\u0026rsquo;s definitely maturing. I would say that I think that we talked about\nthis offline. I think that the LLMs and the Chat GPT kind of analysis is a\ngood example of it. Either will make some of the stuff you do a commodity\nor allow it to be even more relevant. I guess the interesting element here is\nthat I think it allows you to consume a lot more data and to make things a\nlot more customized in context to the person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 38:44\nYou can definitely tune it to say, how do I create a persuasive message for\nsomeone who is like this? And how do I make that just in two lines of text?\nI mean, that\u0026rsquo;s where the language model, I think, can play can come in\nand be really effective and also make it the right sort of level for the\naudience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:04\nExactly. Well, there\u0026rsquo;s a good session for next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTim Ward - 39:07\nYeah, brilliant. Excellent.

Hi. Welcome to this open Security Summit in October 2023. And I\u0026rsquo;m\nhere with Nathan, and Mario is going to join in for a bit, right? And we\u0026rsquo;re\ngoing to be talking about Kubernetes Clusters network security, or I guess\nKubernetes security, right? Because that\u0026rsquo;s really the key topic. So, Nathan,\nwhy don\u0026rsquo;t you kick us off?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 00:22\nSo I guess the question becomes, like, as we look at this whole thing, first\nof all, hey, I\u0026rsquo;m Nate. Secondly, my views are my own. Yada, yada. Not the\ncompany, all of that. But today, as we speak about this, the real question\nbecomes kind of this discussion about what is security and what is\nnetwork security in Kubernetes? And what can you expect? What should\nyou expect, what should you hope mean? When you asked me to do mean,\nlike, honestly, I kind of sat back and okay, like, I just did a talk about\nCubeshark. We can totally talk about Cubeshark. The company I\u0026rsquo;m\nworking for, CORSIA, has a new product called Cast, which is kind of an\nextension of Cubeshark. And there are new things that you can do there.\nThere are a handful of stuff on open source projects we can look at online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 01:05\nBut when it comes to actual security, I mean, what do you guys think? It\nfeels like the network security of days gone by when I used to play with\nswitches and hubs and routers and coax connections, all of that\u0026rsquo;s gone.\nAnd I think we end up with this really interesting, logical setup that,\nfrankly, hasn\u0026rsquo;t existed before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:25\nOne of the things I\u0026rsquo;ve done, which I still feel it worked quite spectacularly,\nwas to build a large number of very small clusters. And I arrived there\nfrom a point of view of having the least amount of moving parts by having\nlots of problems with scaling, right? And this was a project where I had to\ngo from small amount to file spring process to large amount of files. And\nthere\u0026rsquo;s this interesting spot where you start to fight Kubernetes, right? You\nstart to fight the system, and then it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like this thing where\neventually everything starts to break, right? Because you either struggle\nwith the backplane, you struggle with the network, you struggle with the\nability to start new pods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 02:15\nIt\u0026rsquo;s almost become, in a weird way, I felt this anti pattern that suddenly the\nmore stable things become, the more locked things become, the more solid\nthey were. But I was like, hold on. The whole point of Kubernetes is this\ndynamic load, right? It\u0026rsquo;s go up, go down, go up or down. So I started to\ngo into this mode of, okay, what\u0026rsquo;s the smallest cluster that I can do?\nBecause in a way, the irony is that it\u0026rsquo;s almost like you go, okay, you need\nmulti nodes, you need multiple big clusters, because you get resilience. And\nI start saying, yeah, but I\u0026rsquo;m actually losing quite a lot, so I start going,\nokay. So I got to the point where we created one node, and it was one\nnode cluster that had one, basically deployment. We had very small\nnumber of pods that were per application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 03:08\nAnd then the thing that was really interesting is that from a design point of\nview, it really forced you to think, where do you store things? What\u0026rsquo;s\npersistent, what\u0026rsquo;s not persistent? There was tons of problems that existed.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like the HS two. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if you\u0026rsquo;re in the UK or not. Are you in the\nUK?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 03:25\nNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 03:26\nYeah, there\u0026rsquo;s a big shit show here because we had this massive megalomial\nproject of building one thing super big, right? And then of course, he blew\nup. Costs got bigger and bigger because the complexity got bigger and\nbigger with the project. Right. When I was basically thinking about this\nwas like, small clusters actually have lots of advantages because you can\nscale up and down very easily. The only question there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of state. But\nin a weird way, I like that problem because it forced me to take state away\nfor sometimes parts of the cluster which actually make the cluster itself\ndisposable, because it\u0026rsquo;s almost like, think about it, we take Kubernetes, the\nparts should be disposable, but then are the nodes disposable and is the\ncluster themselves disposable?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 04:14\nBecause or else you end up with this gigantic cluster that by the time it\u0026rsquo;s\nup, nobody really understands how the cluster is actually being set up,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 04:25\nTo me being the old guy and saying that to two old guys, but rolling this\nall the way back to the day when we used to have Sans and deal with a\nBrocade fabric infrastructure and deal with VMs that would sit on top of\nthat. And then you deal with network switches and blade switches that\nwould have to sit on top of that. As we start looking at resilience and we\nstart trying to understand what security is, and I say this because it feels\nright to me, and push back, please, if you think I\u0026rsquo;m wrong. And like, you\nwould never but still, the concept being that one of the things that was\nalways really hard was to understand the impact of all of the pieces, parts\nthat went into the whole thing that you were building and we used to have\nto deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 05:11\nThis is my backplane. And my backplane is going to support 20 gigs. And\nif we have a 20 gig backplane, that means that I can sacrifice ten gigs for\nnetwork and ten gigs for storage. And then all of these things start coming\nin and it feels like we\u0026rsquo;re back to almost the exact same thing with\nKubernetes, where I\u0026rsquo;ve got a Kubernetes cluster and now I\u0026rsquo;ve got to figure\nout what are the actual resources that I\u0026rsquo;ve got the ability to begin to\narchitect with. And if I start to build out an application that goes over\nthose resource bounds, then it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 05:42\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s a few things from my perspective, what I see these days is\nthat obviously Kubernetes has a layer of abstraction, but people do not\nintimately understand because you have a number of layers. You have the\nwhole container security. You have container networking security, and then\nyou have obviously host supporting the container security. So people do\nnot understand that. How do you apply security context at the container\nlevel? Then you go into something like Open Policy Agent Apparm, or how\ndo you secure intercontainer communication? And then you go into\nruntime security, something like Falco deployments. There is a lack of\nknowledge and understanding because most of the containers building is\ndone either via DevOps or developers themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 06:34\nSo having we discussed in previous sessions how we can build those\nsecurity reusable blocks, so how we can whitelist a number of container\nimages that has specific security solutions already built in. So you say just\nuse this. There\u0026rsquo;s a big disconnect, I think, especially when you start\nleveraging things like AKS. If you run a production cluster, you get\nobviously Microsoft image that\u0026rsquo;s quite secure. But then if you run the dev\nclusters, you use all sorts of images. There\u0026rsquo;s obviously riddle with\nvulnerabilities. How do you address the change between development\ncluster and production? Because obviously people testing code in various\nenvironments, but if they don\u0026rsquo;t match but.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 07:15\nThat\u0026rsquo;S the beauty, but even beauty of small clusters. See, the beauty of\nsmall clusters is that you can run them locally. So you have the same\ncluster throughout, right? I always felt that the only difference between\nlocal pre prod, so local dev, QA preprod prod, the only difference should\nbe scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 07:38\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m pushing back to the resource question, though, frankly,\nbecause as you start looking at deploying into Azure, you look at\ndeploying into a cloud provider, take your pick of who all of a sudden\nyou\u0026rsquo;ve deployed to two data centers, and those data centers might be 100\nmiles, 150 miles apart. So now, as we look at if we\u0026rsquo;re looking at security\nfrom the vulnerability question that you just brought up, or the question\ngenerally that Marius just talked about, where we start looking at the\nimages and all the other pieces that go into your Kubernetes cluster, what\ndoes it become? Does it become possible for me to evaluate network\navailability, latency things that I normally would have looked at in a\nnetworking implementation for a larger enterprise?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 08:21\nNot really. Well, see, this is the thing. If you have smaller clusters, right,\nyou can simulate all of that because and by the way, smaller could be two,\nthree, four, or five nodes, because the cluster or the cluster of clusters,\nright? That environment is the app, right? So the thing about that, for\nexample, that particular example is that if you can spin up your\nenvironment, you can now run your simulations, right? You can say, okay,\nnow give me this traffic, now do this so what was very interesting is that\nwere able to build very focused testing tools. Again using kubernetes,\nright? Actually, using lambda functions actually was really cool to scale\nup. That could generate an insane amount of traffic. But we able to test,\nyou know what we found? We found that check this out, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 09:12\nThere was a moment where I was deploying the same Kubernetes.\nRemember, this is one node per, but each EC two instance is a Kubernetes\nnode. Each one, right? Each EC two instance is a Kubernetes node. We did\nthis test where I was running, I think it was about 150 EC two instances.\nSo I had 150 clusters across. I think it was five data centers. And then you\nhad 15, right? Basically, because I got to the point where I built a\ncommand line. It was very scary, right? Because I had a command line, I\nwas like, spin this up. How many regions? How many easy to instance per\nimage? And it was the same image everywhere, right? We will run it. You\nknow what happened? After a while, we start to detect wild\ninconsistencies in AWS infrastructure, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 09:59\nSo you would have literally the same request sent to 150 instances, right?\nAnd every now and then and we will keep turning the volume up, right? So\nwe keep finding the point where they were really hot, right? And there was\ninstances that were fine all the time. There was instances that had a\nwobble and there was instance that had fucking leisure heart attacks,\nright? And then when I realized and I remember chatting the AWS guys on\nit\u0026rsquo;s like, yeah, because it depends on the neighbors. But think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 10:31\nNeighbors and a whole bunch of other infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 10:35\nBut think about what that means. It means that we had to add code to our\nclusters to be aware of your environment. So even if you think you have 20\ngigs, you might not have 20 gigs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 10:47\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what I was getting at, was plan the resource plan\noutright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 10:52\nBut no, but this is the difference. It\u0026rsquo;s not even planning is your cluster has\nto adapt itself. So we had a mode where and, you know, the beauty of this\narchitecture is you put load balances in front. You know, what was the\nsolution? Actually, eventually, the solution was kill it. Literally, we got to\nthe point where once the health checks got to a point, reduce the traffic.\nSo take it off from the load balancer, let it die off and kill it. And even\nAWS guy says, yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s the better way. Because if you start a new one,\nyou\u0026rsquo;re going to a different location, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 11:23\nYeah. And that\u0026rsquo;s the point, is that in many cases, really, what you want to\ndo is set up this setup where you\u0026rsquo;re looking at multiple points in your\napplication. And if there\u0026rsquo;s a particular instance that\u0026rsquo;s not working\ncorrectly, you need to know. And that might be just setting up a simple I\nmean, I\u0026rsquo;ve done it before with pings. If you can\u0026rsquo;t ping X or you can\u0026rsquo;t get\nan Http response from just kill it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 11:44\nYeah. But try doing that at node level and it\u0026rsquo;s very hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 11:48\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 11:49\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why the smaller again, the cluster. And then for me, the solution\nhere was to actually create clusters of clusters, even app, because then you\ncan say, what are all the resources?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 12:02\nBut then I\u0026rsquo;m going to push back and say, at what point have you gone too\nfar? At what point have we abstracted to the point of just the silly? Would\nit have been easier to just use, I\u0026rsquo;m going to say elastic beanstalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 12:16\nWell, there\u0026rsquo;s a point where lambdas might be perfectly fine, right, but\nthat\u0026rsquo;s a very valid point. There\u0026rsquo;s a point where, in a way, there should be\nan evolution, right. There\u0026rsquo;s a point where lambdas are not good enough or\ntoo expensive, right. Then that\u0026rsquo;s when you go containers. And there\u0026rsquo;s a\npoint where containers gets too big, that\u0026rsquo;s where you go to the cluster and\nthe moment where in a way, I think it\u0026rsquo;s almost like we try to optimize\nsomething that should not be optimized, which is this idea that, oh, I have\none cluster, I have five clusters. Usually people don\u0026rsquo;t have five clusters.\nThey have one big fuck off one and a couple of redundancy ones. Right. At\nleast that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot. It\u0026rsquo;s very risky, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 12:54\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very risky because it means every time you push a new update, you risk\nblowing up your entire cluster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 13:00\nI think Marius has got a point here, but after Marius goes, then I\u0026rsquo;ve got a\npoint back to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 13:04\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s where you mentioned kind of I think if you discussing\nKubernetes deployments, obviously it comes down to cost, but you need to\nget to the point where you can ultimately run a proper chaos shop, where\nyou can inject faults continuously to evaluate where the problems occur.\nSo being proactivity then, instead of reactive, and then you can plan,\nbecause obviously you foresee particular growth, whether it\u0026rsquo;s traffic,\ncustomer acquisition and things like that, where you can potentially get\nahead of the curve where the problems might occur. And that will feed into\nyour design questions, essentially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 13:47\nYep. And I think you\u0026rsquo;re hitting exactly what I was going to hit Marius, and\napologies, I\u0026rsquo;m a little under the weather today, but I completely agree with\nyou. This is security and resilience by design. You can\u0026rsquo;t just pretend that\nit\u0026rsquo;s going to be OK because you\u0026rsquo;re using Kubernetes and building your\napplication so that it is aware of both the infrastructure that it\u0026rsquo;s on and\nfrankly, the limits of the infrastructure that it\u0026rsquo;s on. And if it realizes that,\nyou know what, I really can\u0026rsquo;t get to this machine over here, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s\ntime to spin up another alternative because I\u0026rsquo;m not working right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 14:21\nI think the bit I like to expand more in terms of security is I always find\nthat the less moving parts, the better, right? So if you take that to an\nextreme and this is where I feel there\u0026rsquo;s a potential that we haven\u0026rsquo;t fully\nfulfilled here, which is that we should be absolutely brutal, for example,\nwith the size of images, absolutely brutal with what\u0026rsquo;s inside the\ncontainers, even what\u0026rsquo;s inside Kubernetes. It\u0026rsquo;s not because the normal\nKubernetes deployment has these features that you wanted. It\u0026rsquo;s almost\nlike, what is the minimal viable deployment that you can do? But here\u0026rsquo;s\nthe problem. This is the thing that I don\u0026rsquo;t think you experience until you\nreally experience kubernetes as a disposable unit is that if you can spin up\nkubernetes clusters super easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 15:08\nAnd by the way, at the moment, last time I checked, AWS clusters or azure\nclusters still take, like, minutes, and I\u0026rsquo;m like, what the hell are they doing\nplaying chess, right? A cluster should start, right? So if your cluster\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t just start super quickly, you can\u0026rsquo;t experiment, right? Think about\nit, every experiment takes ten minutes, 2 hours, whatever, and you can\u0026rsquo;t do\nthat so you can\u0026rsquo;t lock things down because you need the interactivity of\nthe experimentation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 15:36\nLet\u0026rsquo;s be honest, I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s expensive to experiment that way sometimes.\nJust in full disclosure, I have four clusters in my house right now, so it is\nwhat it is, and it\u0026rsquo;s just what I\u0026rsquo;m running here at home, and that\u0026rsquo;s fun and\nI\u0026rsquo;m enjoying it. There\u0026rsquo;s no real reason for me to run Kubernetes in the\nhouse. I mean, come on, that\u0026rsquo;s just silly, but at the same time, it adds\nvalue, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 15:58\nYou can experiment, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 16:02\nBut back to your point, and to the point that in general, I think there\u0026rsquo;s\nsome point at which we\u0026rsquo;re going to have to start looking at what is the\nminimum viable container that we can actually run. So it\u0026rsquo;s become more\nand more concerning to me as we\u0026rsquo;ve talked about different software\nsupply chain attacks and seen different reality as we look at network\nsecurity, that\u0026rsquo;s fine. But the reality is, if my implementation, if my image is\nso bloated with, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a full installation of Take Your Pick of OS, and\nthen I\u0026rsquo;m running my little app inside of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 16:34\nI really like those light images. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 16:37\nWell, the hardened images, yeah, I think we need get to the point where we\njust automatically run a script at the end of it and it looks at it and goes,\noh, I see you\u0026rsquo;re just using these three things and rips out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 16:45\nSo here I\u0026rsquo;m going to bring the good old these days, gen AI, right? And\nLLMs, that\u0026rsquo;s another area where I think it can add crazy value. Imagine a\nworld where we take an image, we feed it to a Gen Tweaked, an agent\nthat\u0026rsquo;s been tweaked for understanding that, and we say, Start removing\nthings, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 17:05\nI don\u0026rsquo;t even know if we need Gen AI to do it. I mean, can\u0026rsquo;t we just do it\nwith a basic process, call and figure out what\u0026rsquo;s running because you need\ncontact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 17:11\nOkay, I think you could do it like that, but that\u0026rsquo;s very complex, very fast\nbecause I think you need a level of reasoning, you need a level of logic that\nis very hard to code. And I could see how having an LLM that has a series\nof prompts and maybe not one, maybe two, three, four or five LLMs\nworking together, I could see how that\u0026rsquo;s much more usable and practical\nthan trying to code. Because to be honest, I think people have tried to do\nit. The problem is you need a degree of context, you need a degree of\nunderstanding and even what\u0026rsquo;s the objective that is very hard to code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 17:50\nYeah, I think you can leverage Geni in a few things because as we\ndiscussed in the beginning, things like mapping of the traffic between the\nspecific containers. So Genai potentially could help you build a map. Who\nneeds to talk with what? But I think, as Nathan mentioned, I think we\nneed to take up a notch because the one thing that is always missed yes,\nwe do in agile sort of deployment and agile code changes and all of that,\nbut drift Analysis, it\u0026rsquo;s one sort of area that\u0026rsquo;s always neglected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 18:31\nWhat do you mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 18:32\nLeveraging something like Open Policy Agent where we can define how\nour production clusters should look like to make sure that we are alerted\nfrom people a making mistakes and B just going berserk on some new\ninnovation that they decided, oh, just deploy and see what happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 18:54\nEven if it\u0026rsquo;s just a basic like I\u0026rsquo;m using this open source library and today it\nchanged from A to 8.1 and all of a sudden it\u0026rsquo;s pulling in a bunch of other\nstuff. I mean, just the drift associated with that alone is significant. And\nnot looking at the packages, not really understanding what the packages\ndo or not understanding some of the impact of those subs is going to be an\nissue. And it\u0026rsquo;s great to say I\u0026rsquo;ve got my S bomb and yay, but if you\u0026rsquo;re not\nactually running it while if you\u0026rsquo;re not getting an S bomb that actually\nincludes all of these other things, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure it really matters much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 19:28\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not even that. I think what you just mentioned, it\u0026rsquo;s a very important\narea to address. I think loads of developers do not understand even how to\nbuild a secure image. What\u0026rsquo;s the best practice in terms of building as\nminimal image as possible, making sure that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t run unnecessary\nupdates and just pulls the correct packages that it only needs to run.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s another area where supply chain is a massive task at hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 20:00\nIt\u0026rsquo;s true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 20:03\nAnd that is an area that I think the new generation or the next generation\nof bots can make a massive difference. Right, because understanding that\ncontext is really hard and I feel that being able to explain the intent, like\nyou just said, imagine Nathan, take that simple case. You want to be able\nto describe. This is a mission critical system. It has his properties. I expect\nthis, I expect his blast radius. I expect that is something that we can now\nstart to describe, to try to codify that will be crazy difficult. We can\ndescribe that behavior. And then we say, by the way, here\u0026rsquo;s a Kubernetes\nconfig file. By the way, here\u0026rsquo;s a helm chart. Is that helm chart going to\nbreak this particular situation? Look, I\u0026rsquo;ve fed TCP dumps, even git\ncommit. Have you fed a git commit to Jtpt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 20:57\nNo, actually I haven\u0026rsquo;t ever tried that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 20:58\nDude, it\u0026rsquo;s freaking awesome. Look. So we\u0026rsquo;re now using it to create\nchange requests, right? And then to describe pull requests. So imagine a\nflow. You know what I found really interesting is as a developer, I actually\nenjoy reading that because I found that it described nicely what I was\nbetter than developer. And sometimes I go, oh, shit, yeah, I missed that\none. Actually, I did change that in the code. But also, even when you make\na little mistake, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. You tweak it, right? So it\u0026rsquo;s still your text,\nit\u0026rsquo;s still your pull request, it\u0026rsquo;s still your commit, but the quality and you\ncan also say, give me a business analysis. Give me a technical analysis.\nGive me in fact, can you say, give me a security analysis of that? So\nimagine that world where imagine that for a helm chart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 21:46\nImagine having a helm chart that describes that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 21:49\nNow timeout before we tell everybody that\u0026rsquo;s ever going to watch this\nvideo to go out and find yourself an LLM and ask it to look at your git\ncommit and your code. Please make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve talked to your CISO,\nlooked at your internal governance policies, and made sure that you\u0026rsquo;re\nallowed to do this so that information doesn\u0026rsquo;t accidentally fall into the\nwrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 22:07\nProperty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:08\nHave Pet open source project that you can do that solves that problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 22:12\nSorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:13\nNo, that was good. Exactly. Yes. Don\u0026rsquo;t go and face their confidential\ndisclaimer into Chat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 22:20\nWell, actually, I feel like I need to say this now. Sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:23\nWell, but to be honest, I think we can already say that these days you\nreally should have private models. Right? Look, Azura has pushed\nbedrock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 22:29\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a great thing to say, but man, the private models aren\u0026rsquo;t nearly as\ngood as the public ones. And it\u0026rsquo;s always going to be that type of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:37\nYeah, well, Azure OpenAI is not that bad. I think it\u0026rsquo;s treadling really close.\nYes. Chat GPT. By the way, have you tried the model one where you can\nupload an image?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 22:50\nNo, I have not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:52\nSimon Worley was like that\u0026rsquo;s the game changer. I think it was really a\ngame changer before that. But I agree that\u0026rsquo;s a game changer. Dude, you\ncan now do an architecture diagram, go to Chatty bikini and says, give me\nan idea, transcribe this, give me a flowchart, give me this in plan to ML,\ngive me this in thing, right? It is pretty freaking cool, right? It\u0026rsquo;s a big game\nchanger, right? But I think the point were just talking, which is how do\nyou create a small possible Kubernetes cluster, for example, or a small\npossible image? I think in the past that was really difficult to do because\nyou couldn\u0026rsquo;t explain intent. And I think we\u0026rsquo;re going to be able to start\ndescribing intent, right? And in fact, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to start describing even\nan image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 23:39\nImagine being able to build an image where you say I want this image to\nbe unusable apart from port 80 and apart from Nodes or Python or Go or\nthis binary. And that\u0026rsquo;s it. That\u0026rsquo;s all you should have. You should have what\nis the minimum viable Linux environment that is required? Start deleting\neverything else, right? In fact, experiment, do chaos on top of it, run it, run\nyour tests and then start deleting stuff that you don\u0026rsquo;t think could be\nusable, right? But imagine doing that in a way that we can describe it,\nright? And imagine that the next generation of an Llam that actually\nunderstands the Linux kernel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 24:18\nWell, yeah, I was going to say, I mean, go so far as to say that I\u0026rsquo;ve done my\nGit push and we\u0026rsquo;ve gone through the whole thing at this point. And instead\nof the build that we would normally do, it actually goes over to the LLM.\nThe LLM builds out the image that would be appropriate to what you just\nasked for. And it\u0026rsquo;s only those things as opposed to everything else and\nthere\u0026rsquo;s really no interaction whatsoever. I mean, none of this stuff is\nrocket science as such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 24:42\nThe only thing I would say there the caveat, I would add, and I think this is\nwhere I think some people I think are flipping. So I don\u0026rsquo;t think the LLM\nbuilds it. I think the LLM analyze creates the pull request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 24:56\nI was going to say propose a.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 24:57\nModification and then there\u0026rsquo;s a build pipeline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 25:01\nThat was I would go so far as to the hardening scripts, almost, and I\nwould agree with you where you\u0026rsquo;re just looking at the hardening scripts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 25:06\nAnd then the other variable here, I think discussion sometimes is that like,\nfor example, even in this workflow, if you think about it, I\u0026rsquo;m not saying\nthat you let an LLM loose it does his magic and then come back tomorrow\nand go, hey, here\u0026rsquo;s your build. What I\u0026rsquo;m saying is that the LLM is going to\nhave a conversation of commits, pull requests, changes, et cetera, that is\ncompletely logged, is completely justified, that we can then go back and\nanalyze. And Mario, this is where I\u0026rsquo;m tying up almost all the sessions. This\nis where when you then look at our situation awareness and instance\nresponse, we should be able to go back and I missed this bit. Oh, this\nshould not supposed to be there. And the big paradigm shift for me, let me\nshow you this image, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 25:50\nBecause I did a presentation on what\u0026rsquo;s it called, on why everything should\nbe a cyber expert. But there\u0026rsquo;s one picture that I showed in there that for\nme was the big game changer, which is this. Can you see my screen? So\nthat one why everyone needs to be an AI expert. So I presented this. But\nthe screen I really want to show is this one here. Have you seen this\nimage?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 26:21\nNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 26:21\nHave you seen this one? Okay. This was the one, ironically, was a visual,\nbut was the one that made me really understand the power of generative is\nthat the square in the middle is the original painting. The rest was created\nby Gen AI. The same way that, for example, here, you got the Mona Lisa\nand then you got the expansion, you got Nirvana and you got expansion,\nyou got, for fun, metallica on a cake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 26:54\nI think the point is what we\u0026rsquo;re talking about and what you mentioned is\nhaving all of the deployment and all of the builds and all of it in LLM.\nBecause what we discussed, I think, and the main topic today is we don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave enough context normally to make right decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 27:14\nWell, and roll back to the Metallica image, to Marius\u0026rsquo;s point here. Roll\nback to the Metallica image. Yeah. Neither does Marius\u0026rsquo;s Point. Metallica\nis not right. That is not a cake. If the LLM gets the wrong idea here,\nMarius, that\u0026rsquo;s going to look bad, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 27:33\nNo, it will. But you know what the power of this is that let\u0026rsquo;s say even this\nhappened, right? Okay, so let\u0026rsquo;s take the analogy, right? This happens.\nSomebody builds a cake, right, with the Metallica logo, right? In the past,\nthe cost of creating that in a different scenario will be massive, right? In\nfact, will be as big, if not more than creating the cake. And that visual,\nright? The power of the way the generative works is that cake is one of\nbillions that you could have done based on the input that we provide. So\nwhen we come around and maybe on an incident we discovered, oh, it\u0026rsquo;s a\ncake, it should not be a cake. You can go back and you can now modify\nthe prompt and say, actually it\u0026rsquo;s like this. Like this. Like this. Like this,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 28:21\nSo that for me is the big paradigm shift. The big paradigm shift is that\nwhat the generative bit does. It means the creation is now cheap or the\nmodification based on the prompt that we can then test and we can\nvalidate and we can diff. We can do all that stuff that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 28:39\nAssumes a human catches it, though. I mean, that\u0026rsquo;s the issue, right? Like\nto Marius\u0026rsquo;s point, and I apologize, marius, I feel like I cut you off there\npretty hard. Is that where you were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 28:50\nWas. Yeah, exactly. Because the point is, as you say, yes, it\u0026rsquo;s cheap to\nexperiment, but if you push the cake into production, what\u0026rsquo;s the outcome?\nMy point is that, yes, we can use LLM, but as long as we said enough\ncontext and we used it in the background while we did a number of\ncommits, number of builds and then they build a context. Of what we need\nfrom security, what developers need, what\u0026rsquo;s the business goals, and then\nwe only start slowly saying, oh, it has enough data, it has enough context\nto know where it should be driving towards. Because if you just ask to\nbuild, say, today, I just plug it in and say, build me a secure image, it\u0026rsquo;s\ngoing to build you a cape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 29:37\nBut see, here\u0026rsquo;s where I would draw the line today. See, I would argue\ntoday you don\u0026rsquo;t want the LLM to create the cape. Right? You don\u0026rsquo;t want\nthe LLM to create the output that ends up being in production. You want\nto use the LLM to aid the human, to augment the visibility, to augment the\nunderstanding of what\u0026rsquo;s there. And that\u0026rsquo;s a very different proposition. And\nthat\u0026rsquo;s where hallucinations become less of a problem because there\u0026rsquo;s\nenough checks and balances in the system. So if I ask an LLM to say,\nhere\u0026rsquo;s a bit of code and analyze this for me, whoever wrote that or\nwhoever\u0026rsquo;s in this loop can say that\u0026rsquo;s right? That\u0026rsquo;s wrong. Right? And then\neven if you do analysis on top of it, eventually you\u0026rsquo;re going to figure out,\nwell, that analysis was wrong. So you can modify it if you\u0026rsquo;ve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 30:25\nGot checks and balances in place. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s the point. What we discussed\nearlier, you said you don\u0026rsquo;t want the LLM to build, you want the pipeline to\nbuild. But if it just goes automatically by the pipeline build into the\nproduction, then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 30:37\nObviously we have yeah, but we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t allow that. By the way, that\u0026rsquo;s\nalready happening today anyway. How much commit today happens on\nyour pipelines that nobody really checked properly? Right? If you have dev\nteam shipping 2030 5000 times a day, how many of those commits have\nbeen looked at from the security team? Yeah. Even if you have static\nanalysis and dynamic analysis, right. The percentage, even if you have is\nstill that is already happening today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 31:04\nRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 31:04\nWe\u0026rsquo;re already shipping to production code. But I\u0026rsquo;m not saying we should\nallow the LLMs to do that, even with automation. I\u0026rsquo;m saying we should be\nusing them is in the steps in the middle to allow us to understand context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 31:18\nI think as we go there and we push back to the original topic that were\nsupposed to be talking about, which is networking in Kubernetes, if we can\nlook at these things that actually build out the build scripts for us, if you\nwill, that will allow us to build out the cluster that we\u0026rsquo;re going to get in\nthe end and deploy the application. It would be really great if we could\nthen go ahead and comma. And could you give me a network security\nmapping or detection system that would allow me to see things that are\nnot supposed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 31:45\nCan you write the rules for me? Can you give me the error rules?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 31:47\nCan you give me the for example, it\u0026rsquo;s basically Iptables. Why is this a hard\nthing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 31:53\nBecause it\u0026rsquo;s because until you have an LLM, the cost of engineering was\ngreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 31:59\nI understand that. What I\u0026rsquo;m saying is, as you talk to the LLM, this is just\nIP tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:05\nIt is, but the level of complexity is too high. If I go to you and say, can you\ntake your helm charts, your live processes, your execution logs, your IP\ntables, your flow data or your analysis of it? Can you mash it up and give\nme a view and inconsistencies you turn around and going, Great. Give me\ntwo to $5 million of development and I build it for you. And even what you\nbuild might be highly freaking locked in and customized. That. Question\nwith an LLM, you can now look at that problem very differently. You can\nlook at creating abstraction layers at every point and then connecting the\ndots and connecting the intents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:44\nAnd I think there\u0026rsquo;s going to be a huge amount of innovation there because\nwe now can ask these questions in ways I think we can now start to ask\nquestions, say, can you start to output data in ways that are easy to\nunderstand? Can you start to output intent from your information? Which\nwe\u0026rsquo;re going to have other vulnerabilities and we\u0026rsquo;re going to have to deal\nwith it, et cetera, but at least that can be checked. At least we can start to\nlearn to trust or not to trust some of these analysis. And, you know, at that\nmoment in time, the smaller the LLM, the less scope he has, the better it\nwill be. I want an LLM that only understands IP tables. That\u0026rsquo;s it all he\ndoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:23\nI want an LLM that only understands network diagrams, blah, blah, has a\nvery small subset, doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to write poetry, doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to know about\nNIST, doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to know all that shit. Just needs to have enough context\nthat we can then prove with behavior, with analysis, with battle hardened,\nand with idea, with evidence eventually that it does that really well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 33:47\nTotally agree with the thought. Please, go ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 33:49\nQuestion nathan, I wanted to pick your brains a bit. So we discussed\nabout correct image builds. Some things like app armor, open policy agent\nand things like that. How we build secure clusters from the get go. What\u0026rsquo;s\nyour vision about? People might miss or might not know how to do these\nthings, so instead they say, oh, let\u0026rsquo;s plug in runtime protection. Something\nlike Sysdig or whatever datadog or any other sort of company that uses\nruntime protection and just see how they can help secure us. Kubernetes\nfrom the other angle, what\u0026rsquo;s your view between the two thoughts of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 34:36\nSo, a long time ago, in a galaxy far away, I worked at AWS, and we\nreleased some really interesting stuff in Lambda. And a company that no\nlonger exists. I believe it got acquired. And a friend over in England\nactually wrote a script that would strip everything out of the lambda\ncontainer that you didn\u0026rsquo;t need. And it would just automatically, like, you\nwould push your script, it would run, it would strip everything out of the\nlambda container that you didn\u0026rsquo;t need, and it would remove all of the AWS\npermissions that it didn\u0026rsquo;t need to have. And it was cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 35:13\nThat\u0026rsquo;s cool. Where\u0026rsquo;s that feature? Where\u0026rsquo;s that feature? In AWS. I want it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 35:20\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know. I stopped working at AWS a while ago. I apologize. But it\nwas one of the coolest things that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen Dave do in a long time, and it\nwas really legitimately helpful. And I Think What I\u0026rsquo;d Like To See, to\nAnswer The Question in Sort Of A Roundabout Way, marius Is More This\nConcept Of and Kind Of Going All The Way Back To in Days Of Yor And\nYonder when we used to have to build out a sand and plan out what the\nbackplane was going to do and understand all of the implications for all of\nthe different drive speeds and how the fiber channel was going to interact\nwith all of these things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 35:56\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s something to be said for it would be really nice if we could\nget Kubernetes to just load up and go, hey, you\u0026rsquo;re using this and you don\u0026rsquo;t\nneed that, and automatically strip it out. I don\u0026rsquo;t care who it is. Honestly,\nit\u0026rsquo;d be really nice if we could just accept the fact that realistically, we don\u0026rsquo;t\nneed 90% of the container we just uploaded. And even if I can just run a\nfunction that spends a day running it through a significant number of\ndifferent interactions on the API layer and then gives me a list of, hey,\nthese are the things you actually need, versus These are the things you\nactually have, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t strike me like it\u0026rsquo;s that much of a walk to do it. I\nthink Netflix had something called Goat for a while, didn\u0026rsquo;t they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 36:38\nThat did a very similar sort of a thing. And it\u0026rsquo;s one of those things where,\nfrom a security geek point of view, it would be really nice to be able to\nbuild out my hardening scripts that way, as opposed to having to hand jam\nthe whole thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 36:50\nDennis, you ready to build a company? We just got an idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:55\nYeah, I feel it starts to be doable now. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 37:02\nI think we\u0026rsquo;re on the edge. Yeah, I think we\u0026rsquo;re right at the precipice of you\ncould do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:06\nSo he\u0026rsquo;s an interesting question. That\u0026rsquo;s why one of the slides I have on that\npresentation is that everybody should either be panicked, be very excited\nor a lot of people are ignoring it. Right. But what I think is interesting in\nthe next couple of years is going to be which industry is going to innovate\nmore? Is it the security industry or, for example, the developer industry?\nBecause, for example, what you describe could be done by a dev tool or by\na security tool. We don\u0026rsquo;t care. We just want one of them to do it. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 37:31\nI disagree. I completely and utterly disagree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:34\nWhat do you mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 37:36\nI think security is smoke. I think as a security geek, I kid you not. I think\nsecurity is just development that we\u0026rsquo;ve tried to make special and different.\nAnd the reality is development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:48\nWe live on the outskirts of inefficiency of industries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 37:51\nI really think that we should just embrace the fact that security is\ndevelopment and it should be a development tool, and that\u0026rsquo;s just good\ndevelopment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:58\nI agree with that. No, I\u0026rsquo;m saying that which side is going to innovate? Are\nyou going to do this from a security angle?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 38:05\nI would hope that we do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:06\nFrom a development or you do it from a development angle? Where that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 38:09\nI would hope we do it from a development angle and we grow towards\nsecurity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:12\nI agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 38:14\nAngle. It\u0026rsquo;s more chances to succeed. Because if we\u0026rsquo;ll be done from security\nangle, the marketing will be, oh, we make your Kubernetes 100% secure.\nWe 100% protect from breaches and all DA DA. And it will become a\nsnake oil, and nobody\u0026rsquo;s going to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:30\nYeah, but what we should be doing in security is saying, we make your\nproduct faster. Resilient. A read only container is super resilient. Right.\nLike the ability to diff the containers, the ability to, like I said, measure\nthat delta. The thing about security is that we do have a bit of a different\nperspective. In fact, when I was a CTO, I argued that my understanding of\nwhat was possible is very different. Like the Kubernetes model that I\ndescribed to you guys. I arrived there from both I was CISO and CTO. I\narrived there from two hats. I wanted a small possible container from a\nsecurity point of view. Small possible development. I want to lock it down\neasily, and I want the small possible piece from engineering point of view.\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:14\nI had to argue with Kubernetes experts because they said that\u0026rsquo;s not how\nKubernetes supposed to work. Literally. They just didn\u0026rsquo;t have the mental\nbandwidth to take a little step back and going, okay, maybe that\u0026rsquo;s what I\nwas designed. Yes, you master and slave are not in the same box, but\nmaybe that\u0026rsquo;s not a bad thing. Right. But it was funny. Cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 39:34\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I go back to the discussion about, like, forever ago, when we\nused to have to think about all those little pieces. You were going to build\nout a data center and you had to know, where do all those go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:44\nNow? It should be disposable right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 39:46\nIt\u0026rsquo;s all this big, and the data center is literally yeah, but our Clusters are\nmassive. The intel nuck in my basement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:52\nYeah, but our clusters are massive at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 39:54\nThey are? Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:56\nSo are they a pets? They should not, but they are. When was last time they\ngot rebuilt? When was last time? Can you go and delete it all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 40:06\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see. Last time they got rebuilt from scratch. From scratch? Let me\ncheck. Hang on. They\u0026rsquo;ve been up for one day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 40:15\nGood. What about your production in your company? The production?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 40:19\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a different question. That\u0026rsquo;s none of my business. I don\u0026rsquo;t ask those\nquestions right now. It\u0026rsquo;s all good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 40:27\nCool. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good session. I think any final remarks, comments on\nthis?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 40:35\nI would say that Kubernetes security is becoming more and more\nprominent question that needs addressing. And I think what we just\ndiscussed in terms of we need more fresh ideas, looking at different angles\nand stepping away from what is needed. I think sometimes we do security\nand development through not necessarily of security, but we make it more\ncomplicated than it has to be. And it becomes sort of a barrier to entry\nwhere we border ourselves and saying, oh, we do this very complicated\nthings that nobody could understand. Therefore we lack innovation and\nperspective from different angles. I think that\u0026rsquo;s where we need to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 41:16\nAnd we get into diversity there too. Not that we don\u0026rsquo;t have three white\nguys talking on this, but at the same point, diversity of thought and\ndiversity in general in doing this type of thing is desperately important.\nBecause if you don\u0026rsquo;t do that, the only thing you come up with is the exact\nsame idea over and over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 41:36\nAnd I think there\u0026rsquo;s a couple of startups we already described on this\npresentation. Right. I do feel that the Gen AI is the game changer here. It\nbrings capabilities that before were just too complex to do, but not to\nmake the cake to analyze on the way to the output. Cool. Brilliant guys.\nThank you.

My name is Francesco Sipolone. I\u0026rsquo;m the CEO and founder\nof Phoenix Security and today I want to bring you on a date with me and\non a journey on vulnerability. I\u0026rsquo;ve been in vulnerability management across\napplication security, cloud security and traditional infrastructure for most\nof my life and I have one thing to share with all of you I never actually fix\na critical vulnerability or a vulnerability at all for what it concerns. I only\nfocus on risk and I want to bring you on a journey to actually explain why\nrisk is really the king of decision making from an engineering perspective,\nbut also from a business perspective.\n00:45\nBusiness tend to say we need to act securely but what that practically\nmeans is ephemera and it tend to convert into lip service of yes, we are a\nsecure business but what that actually mean in terms from an engineering\nperspective is always fuzzy. And I want to take you today on a story and\non a journey on how to make that message and that risk profile really\nactionable. And we can only do that with automation, with data and with\nrisk. Security is heavy enough and in order to make it lighter we need to\nuse meme. And that\u0026rsquo;s the benefit of being in security, I guess. So I hope\nyou tolerate memes because this presentation makes quite a use of it.\n01:40\nAnd security, as I said, is heavy enough that if we approach it with a laugh\nand with a joke then the message goes through in a bit easier way. So as I\nmentioned, every presentation need to have the speaker slide me, big face\nand smiling. So you can see it here, you can see it there. But I\u0026rsquo;ve been in\nthe industry for the past 1520 years working across cloud security,\napplication security and vulnerability management. I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about\nthis field, as you can feel and see. I\u0026rsquo;ve been speaking about how to\napproach vulnerability in a better approach and avoiding burnout of\nsecurity professionals. One of the challenge that I always had is everybody\nseems to have an opinion around vulnerability and risk. But it\u0026rsquo;s really hard\nwhen you have data that backs you up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e02:34\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really hard to argue with data and when you are approached on I\nthink this is exploitable versus there is an exploit available. This machine is\nactually externally facing the likelihood of exploitation is x. It\u0026rsquo;s really hard\nto argue with that information unless you\u0026rsquo;re a data scientist. And we have\nthe session coming up next where we can discuss and debate around data\nscience and which data set do you choose as a reference to use? So on\ntoday\u0026rsquo;s presentation, I want to walk you through the scenario, the current\nlandscape and the data that sits behind the current landscape and the\ncurrent approach that is usually based on SLA and how do we take that\napproach into the next generation, into the next level? And that is using\nrisk.\n03:27\nAnd I say the risk is the great unifier, because unify a lot of this data\nelement and help us driving a data driven approach on vulnerability and\nrisk. And to do so, I\u0026rsquo;m going to explore all the data sets that sits behind\nour research as Phoenix between criticality of vulnerability and the\ntraditional data set that we have from MVD. The popularity of Unexploit,\nthe new addition of Ransomware and CVE use in the Ransomware, EPSs\nand Edge cases where some of this data might not work. So caveats and\ngotcha where some of these data don\u0026rsquo;t work. And as I mentioned, I\u0026rsquo;ve\nbeen in this journey, I feel your pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e04:11\nAnd every organization that starts in the vulnerability management space\nacross cloud security or application security or container security is\nusually presented with a panel of red and critical alert and sometimes\nfalse positive that is difficult to explore. And usually we tend to believe the\nscanner data as the scanner has spoken, the oracle has spoken. And\nwhatever the scanner says, it tend to be taken seriously. But the more we\ndig into the data, the more we find that some of this information is\nactually not properly relevant for us, or actually might not be applicable\nor might be a false positive, or might be less critical than what an scanner\nsay. If we take the example of log four J, a scanner has a specific limited\nview of what a critical is critical. And the other aspect is a security\nprofessional.\n05:10\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t have the empathy with how engineering works and we tend to\nflood all this problem into the engineering backlog that have a lot of other\npiece of work to actually continue working because that\u0026rsquo;s their day job.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not fixing vulnerability day in and day out, despite the fact a security\nprofessional that we hope that will be their job, or we have a dedicated\nperson to actually do so. And usually that\u0026rsquo;s the challenge with security\nchampion, but we\u0026rsquo;re going touch on that later. The challenge is of security.\nWe think security is a business problem, but business doesn\u0026rsquo;t recognize\nsecurity as a business problem or as a product problem. And we as a\nsecurity professional don\u0026rsquo;t recognize our element as part of the workflow\nand the lifecycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e05:54\nSo we end up in this situation where here there\u0026rsquo;s a vulnerability report or\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a pen test report, you\u0026rsquo;re going to fix all of it right, you\u0026rsquo;re going to\nat least focus on all, at least the critical. And that\u0026rsquo;s what usually happened\nis business tends to wave off risk, tends to wave off criticality tend to\naccept the risk in a blindfolded way because they don\u0026rsquo;t have a way to\nunderstand what is the impact for them in their own world. And then that\nleads into GRC and into vulnerability table that are completely\ndisconnected and risk acceptance table that are completely disconnected\nwith the reality.\n06:34\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;re going to have a meeting with a talk next week with the head of\nGRC and Star program from Netflix exactly on these topics to actually\ndive deeper on the connection between risk management, GRC and\nengineering and how we can make this alive and based on data. There\u0026rsquo;s a\nvery new approach for this, but ultimately our goal as security\nprofessional and as an engineers and as engineers inside a piece of work\nor inside an organization is identifying what to fix first. That is probably\nnot very easy and is actually not very easy as a job. And the bigger the\norganization grows, the more challenging this becomes.\n07:18\nBecause when you have an organization like an SME with 1000\nemployees, 100 developers that work throughout and two security\nprofessionals that probably need to balance a lot of things, but at least\nthose security professionals have a lot of time or have an X amount of time\nto actually deal with security engineers everybody knows with each other.\nSo you have that personal relationship. It still takes a lot of time to\nactually analyze a vulnerability, but you can coordinate that approach in a\nbit easier way. Now when you get to a mid size or a large enterprise, the\ndisconnection between security business and engineering becomes wider\nand the time you have to actually look at the vulnerability become less and\nless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e08:04\nAnd what I like to focus on is, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to see the data on it, we\nhave tons of vulnerability but only 10% are actually, the vulnerabilities are\nreally exploitable, it\u0026rsquo;s actually less and 5% of the total number of the\nvulnerability are actually reachable and 1% are, the vulnerabilities have\nbeen targeted now. So let\u0026rsquo;s see some of these data. And this is part of a\nGhana research that was looking at out of a sample set of vulnerability\nthat we consider, how many of them, how many of the 20,000 are actually\nexploitable. And this is just one of the factor that we can consider and we\nwill consider in this presentation. Just one of these factor will reduce\ndrastically the amount of vulnerability that you have to look at, up to 1%\nalmost or 10% of that number.\n08:57\nThe challenge is even with that percentage is a lot of vulnerability. And if\nwe look at how we approach vulnerability right now across application\nsecurity and vulnerability management in the cloud and on premises, we\ntend to focus on SLA. And SLA is inherently a bad number because it\u0026rsquo;s flat\nand it doesn\u0026rsquo;t consider the risk level of a specific organization or a risk\nlevel of a specific team or application. So what that result is that SLA get\nmissed all the time because they\u0026rsquo;re flat across the board. So even if you\nfocus on the top critical vulnerability, you will not be able to focus on the\nmedium vulnerability and the low vulnerability and the ticket time start\nticking as soon as the vulnerability get discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e09:44\nThere are other and specific piece of work that we\u0026rsquo;ve done around SLAs\ntime to resolve and when SLA time has started ticking. So we\u0026rsquo;re not going\nto go in this right now. But there are other considerations around SLA and\nwhy SLA in itself is an inherently bad information. Now let\u0026rsquo;s dive deeper\non why are we in this situation and why there is a lot of alert fatigue and\nalert panning. So if you look at the raw vulnerability data from NVD, we\ncan see a bias of the vulnerability database that critical and high.\nVulnerability almost form the 55% and above 58% of the total number of\nvulnerability available in the NVD and then the medium are actually a\nhuge number. There\u0026rsquo;s always just 1% of vulnerability.\n10:34\nSo there is very high chance that if we take in consideration critical and\nhigh, we consider almost half if not more of the 270,000 vulnerabilities\nthat are right now available in the NBD. Now, if we explore a little bit\nmore on the typology of the vulnerability or the effect of a vulnerability,\nwe can start seeing patterns of things that are exploited at scale. Like\nremote code execution is just a 30% of the vulnerability, but those are the\none most dangerous. And then if we pair this one up with the vulnerability\nthat are actually reachable from a network perspective and external, that\nis another way to cut the vulnerability data sources and focusing just on a\npercentage basic of those vulnerability that are effective. And this doesn\u0026rsquo;t\nrequire any additional technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:22\nThis is just analysis on a classifier that you can use to actually classify the\nvulnerability by typology of effect or typology of attack. Like buffer\noverflow memory corruption, SQL injection and cross site scripting tend\nto be more dangerous in the back end application, while cross site\nscripting SSRF and openredirect input validation. While input validation\nmight be more widespread, the others tend to be more on a front end. So\nyou can also see which typology of vulnerability are there. And we\u0026rsquo;ve seen\nover the years that the vulnerability have changed and have evolved\ncertain type of vulnerability, we stopped seeing them altogether. Certain\nother are increasing like cross site scripting because of the web and API\nusage and widespread usage.\n12:15\nThose vulnerabilities have stayed there while memory corruption if you\ncan see, has a deep dive because of the adoption of new and modern\nframework that we have. But in general the web based vulnerability like\ncross site Request Forgery and SSRF or CSRF, those are the two request\nForgery. Those are still very high, still today because those are\nvulnerability that are exploited at scale and on the website. So because of\nour interconnected word, those are still applicable and very modern. Now\nlet\u0026rsquo;s look at a funnel and I\u0026rsquo;ve been talking about the 10% of vulnerability\nmatter, the 1% I\u0026rsquo;m going to show you and I\u0026rsquo;m going to prove you with\ndata on how you can reduce your vulnerability to the 0.1% of the total\nnumber of vulnerability database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e13:10\nNow at this point in time we actually push in 207,000 vulnerability in the\nNVD and more being recorded. So far we\u0026rsquo;ve done an enormous amount of\nresearch to actually cross reference all the vulnerabilities that are\navailable in GitHub and all this information are available on our website\nto further review and cross reference some of these data sets. But just this\nand the Bug bunty Hot vulnerability, we already reduced that 204,000\nvulnerability in 9000 vulnerability, 70,000 for the one active in the Bug\nbunty platform and 9000 just in the one that are potentially exploitable.\nSo GitHub exploit available, proven exploit available. Now, if you narrow\ndown on the actual Verified Exploit and you can take CISA Care, for\nexample, or the Non Exploited Vulnerabilities, a manually curated\ndatabase of vulnerability from CISA, part of the US government\nsponsorship or GitHub.\n14:18\nVerified Exploited is data set that we analyze cross referencing where a\nvulnerability is actually used in the wild and has a module in meta, exploit\nand other exploit databases. Those vulnerability are reduced to zero point\n41% to 1000 roughly vulnerability from the original 204,000 vulnerability.\nSo we already are targeting zero point 41% of the total landscape of\nvulnerability. Now if we further narrow down and we take into\nconsideration things like exploit prediction scoring system or EPSs that is\nbasically looking at the probability of exploitation right now and in the\nnext 30 days of specific vulnerability coming from a series of honeynet\ndata. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to discuss later on with one of the creator of EPSs\nfrom Cntia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e15:09\nWe are already going down to zero point 19% and then if we cross\nreference the active exploit or the verified exploit in GitHub that have a\nhigh percentage of EPSs or EPSs above 0.7. We are already a 0.1 or 0.2%\nfrom the original 240,000 vulnerability. We narrow down the scope and\nthe focus to 400 vulnerability and then if we take it further on and say\nokay, which one of these 400 vulnerability are actually exploited or\nactually present externally or which one are these on critical asset? If you\ntake even these two elements into consideration we are going to be on\n.0.1% or 0.1% of those original data set. This to say that we don\u0026rsquo;t need to\nsubmit to the vulnerability overload and to the scanner overload and be\nflooded with all this alert fatigue and without this information.\n16:18\nThe challenge is as a business we hear Lock for J or we hear critical\nvulnerability or a zero day and the knee jerk reaction is panic. Do I have\nthat problem? Am I going to get hacked? As a business owner those are\nthe information that cause panic and the knee jerk reaction is talking to\nmy security professional and saying are we going to get hacked, let\u0026rsquo;s fix\nall this problem altogether. And we\u0026rsquo;ve seen this year that we had one of\nthese high critical alert on a weekly basis or recently we had curl and Lib\ncurl that was vociferated as critical vulnerability, it was actually reduced\nto much less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e17:00\nLock for J, spring for Shell again last year were causing massive panic on\nUpdating library directly and indirectly and without this data we can\u0026rsquo;t\nactually sort out or we can figure out between those vulnerability and\nother critical vulnerability which one are going to get us hurt. And without\ndata we\u0026rsquo;re never going to be able to have that judgment or fight back or\ndiscuss back with the business on saying these are our external asset, these\nare the one vulnerabilities that are actually likely to be exploited because\nthey have an exploit available and highly likely to be exploited in the wild.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s focus on the external surface first and then the second line of\nexternal surface and then all the way down to the internal in a sequenced\napproach. No business person will ever fight back.\n17:48\nThat kind of reasoning because it\u0026rsquo;s logical and it\u0026rsquo;s based on data. So\nbusiness and how do we communicate with the business with all of this\nvery technical information and how we can convert this into a business\ntalk? What is love or what is risk, baby doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt me. And as I said, we\nneed to joke a little bit on these terms because if we only talk about data,\nit becomes a little bit heavier. So I want to go with you on a journey on\nwhy I really like risk as a way to communicate with the business on these\nkind of terms of likelihood of exploitation and the ability to discern on\nwhat is more risky. What is less risky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18:37\nThe challenge is when you talk to an executive or anybody on the C suite\nand you start talking about vulnerability, the reaction is I don\u0026rsquo;t understand\nthis report, I don\u0026rsquo;t understand these tons of information on this executive.\nI had tons of critical, which one do we focus? Are we going to get hacked?\nThose are the information knee jerk reaction that we\u0026rsquo;re going to get from\na business person. And if we present that on a weekly basis, we\u0026rsquo;re going to\nget kind of a rejection by default because if we scream continuously that\nwe have critical, critical problem, the reaction is maybe those critical\nproblem are not that critical. On the other point, if we talk about risk to\nthe engineering community, they talk about number of sprint stories or\nnumber of action points that needs to be done on the next sprint.\n19:33\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re working in Scrum or Agile, those kind of terms don\u0026rsquo;t\ncommunicate and don\u0026rsquo;t tell them anything that is relevant in their context.\nSo we need to be able to speak with the business in term of risk because\nthat\u0026rsquo;s in their context. They can express I want to operate at this risk level\nor I want to operate at this other risk level and that doesn\u0026rsquo;t even tell\nengineers what critical vulnerability they need to solve. But we can\ntranslate that information from an engineering perspective on which are\nthe critical vulnerability or the non critical vulnerability that\u0026rsquo;s going to\nhave the biggest impact to achieve that risk level from a business\nperspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e20:07\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s the way to connect a risk objective that is a context of business\ninto engineering community, into number of action that needs to be\nresolved or execute to actually meet those expectations and in order to do\nso it\u0026rsquo;s not rocket science, it\u0026rsquo;s not ephemeral science and this is our\ninterpretation of risk. So we take the base severity of the vulnerability and\nwe use base severity for a very specific reason. We use base severity\nbecause it\u0026rsquo;s a common language across all the vulnerability that we have\navailable right now and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t tamper with any other information.\nThen we take the probability of exploitation that is derived by in an\nautomated fashion and in an automated way by the likelihood of\nexploitation.\n20:53\nIf there is threat intelligence that tell us that information on that\nvulnerability is exploited in the wild if there is a fix available or not, or\nwhere that particular asset located externally facing or internally facing is\nand all of those information give us a good sense of what is the likelihood\nof exploitation, of a specific vulnerability, then the last but not least\nimportant element of risk is what is the business impact? How much this\nparticular set of risk is going to impact me as a business or how many user\nor how much importance has this particular application. Now I want to\nsay and I want to put a caveat that I\u0026rsquo;m not going to go in detail around\nseveral aspects but it is important to consider in further research on three\nterms that is reachability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21:49\nSo if a particular vulnerability is actually reachable from a network\nperspective or non network perspective or a particular line of code is\nactually reachable from a library perspective, those concepts we\u0026rsquo;re going\nto go around those concepts we can actually build a whole presentation\naround it and we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking in the past around this. But exploitability\nis another concept that we really talk into and through and we\u0026rsquo;re going to\nsee a little bit more because it\u0026rsquo;s relevant to this particular presentation\nversus context that we already discussed and there is business context as\nwell as system context. So where that particular vulnerability manifest\nfrom a network perspective, from a location perspective, is it external, is it\ninternal the system where that particular vulnerability manifest? So let\u0026rsquo;s\nsee the magic behind risk and risk calculation.\n22:43\nNow I tend to use and attend to love the use of a matrix that is easy to\nharder in term of automation and in term of data accessibility. Now we\nhave the level one where we can take all the vulnerability in bulk and\nautomate using and achieving, as we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in the funnel before, a very\nfinite and a very short number of vulnerability or finite number. Of\nvulnerability looking if there is an exploit available or if people are\ntargeting that particular vulnerability that\u0026rsquo;s what we call popularity with\nbug banti or if in the CVSS vector this particular vulnerability is\nattackable by a network perspective. And this particular vulnerability has\na remote code execution attribute that will tell us that it\u0026rsquo;s easy or to a\nspecific percentage to deploy a piece of code remotely to the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e23:38\nNow reachability from a code perspective and partially from a network\nperspective becomes much harder to understand and calculate, where the\nother factor that we explored are easier to calculate because there is data\navailability already at scale on those information. And the scale between\nharder and easy on this scale, on the vertical scale is a risk, reward\nopportunity that I see. So the harder it is, the harder and more time and\neffort we need to invest in terms of calculating this information and the\nless we receive in terms of benefit from this calculation. So we like to\nbalance and take an approach that takes a lot of this information and\nenough information that enable us to make a decision because that\u0026rsquo;s the\nultimate goal we want from a triaging perspective and from a\nvulnerability management perspective.\n24:33\nSo from a location perspective we can see if something is exploitable\nremotely where it is from a location perspective is it externally facing? Is it\ninternally facing and more harder to calculate? Is there a particular\nattack chain path that this particular vulnerability or a set of\nvulnerabilities can be chained together? Again from easier I mentioned the\ndata point from the easier point to the harder point and those needs to be\nconsidered from a risk perspective. And lastly but not least is business\ncriticality. So is this particular application business critical for me? And\nhence I need to focus a bit more or less. And hence we have two system\nthat is a business impact assessment or fair analysis that is a bit more\ncomplex and deliver a more granular perspective on risk and business\nimpact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e25:25\nBut also it\u0026rsquo;s much harder to implement at least the area that we can\u0026rsquo;t\nreally automate. That is the manual triage. So this is the last stage where\nwe can determine if it\u0026rsquo;s a false positive. It\u0026rsquo;s something that\u0026rsquo;s been raised\nby the scanner that is actually not exploitable but there is an element that\nwe\u0026rsquo;re doing right now that is we put false positive and manual triage at\nthe beginning of the flow, not at the end of the flow. Hence at the end of\nthis flow the number of vulnerability that we end up dealing with is 0.1%.\nIf we put the manual triage at the beginning of the flow the number of\nvulnerability that we have to deal is 270,000.\n26:07\nSo there is a scale difference in here and the likelihood and the chance in\nterm of risk reward perspective that something going to go amiss is very\nhigh while in this chance in this particular environment is very low. Now if\nwe take the concept of exploitability we have different level of\nexploitability. We have how likely is vulnerability to be exploited in the wild\nby popularity? So how many people are looking at it, how many link in\nGitHub are available or in packets form or how many people are targeting\nthat particular vulnerability. From a bug bunting perspective, from an\nexploitability perspective, we have also the element of zero day where\nthere is no patch available. So usually those are not it\u0026rsquo;s rare that we hear\na zero day, that we usually hear a zero day when it\u0026rsquo;s too late and when it\u0026rsquo;s\nexploiting the wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e27:06\nSo for this there are Mitigating control and mitigation element, there is a\nGoogle zero day project and Trend Micro zero day project that have some\nof this information available and few other less more obscure sources of\ninformation about zero day. As I mentioned before, there is an element of\nautomation of an exploit and hence executability by automation. That is\nthere a vector or a particular element in the vector that tells us that\nexploit is remotely executable or requires zero authentication? Those are\nthe two parameters we tend to focus a lot in the vulnerability exploit or if\nthat particular vulnerability is a remote code execution, hence the exploit\nand the payload of a vulnerability can be deployed remotely. And the other\ndata aspect that is really key to actually prioritize vulnerability is this\nparticular exploited at scale and is actively used at scale.\n28:09\nNow, there are caveats where the threat intelligence come into place,\nwhere certain cases shows us from a broad cyber threat intelligence that\nthis vulnerability is exploited in the wild at broad scale. And then there is\ntargeted CTI that tells us there are specific threat actors that are targeting\nthis set of vulnerability at scale because of ransomware, because of your\nindustry, because of you. And there is an element of risk reward against in\nthis prospective where if your loss or the consequence of an exploit are\nactually super high, you should consider targeted CTI or expensive CTI,\nbecause it tends to be not. Cheap to implement good CTI because it\u0026rsquo;s\nusually manually analyzed data that needs to be put in there. But that has\nan extreme value if you can identify and exploit before you get hit again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e29:07\nRisk Reward Perspective the broad CTI like EPSs enabled you to jump on\na vulnerability or to reduce the noise of a vulnerability. Now, as part of the\ndata analysis, we did an overview of the top ten vulnerability that is either\nmore exploited, more critical or more exploited at scale. Now, the\npopularity concept, again we can see some pattern around. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting\nto see that the top critical vulnerability are actually Oracle, Apache,\nDebian while the more exploited vulnerability from EPSs perspective and\nin terms of number of exploit available at scale is actually Microsoft. So if\nyou already take criticality as an element to actually decide if a\nvulnerability is exploitable or not, you\u0026rsquo;re really too late and you\u0026rsquo;re already\ndoing something wrong because you\u0026rsquo;re focusing on the wrong\nvulnerability that people are not looking at versus you missing the\nvulnerability that people are looking at.\n30:09\nOracle and Log four J is popular and kind of across the board available\nthroughout Apache threads, debian vulnerability. These all come from the\namount of installation and we\u0026rsquo;re going to see this number actually\nreconfirmed from who is targeting this vulnerability at scale from a\nransomware perspective. And I have one of my favorite sentences not all\nthe critical are critical and not all the source are actually good source of\ninformation. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to see and compare here in the next section\nsource of vulnerability information. I\u0026rsquo;m going to go a little bit faster. So\non the left we\u0026rsquo;re going to see the analysis from GitHub NVD database and\non the right we\u0026rsquo;re going to see the Caesar cave and EPSs and compared it\nto data set. If we see the first data set that is just criticality again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e31:05\nOracle, Apache, Debian, Microsoft, those are performing well while in\nCisco kev in terms number of vulnerabilities that are actually actively that\nhave an active exploit at scale, we can see Microsoft jumping very high up\nin the score Adobe apple. So there is a big discrepancy between choosing\njust the critical vulnerability or looking at the vulnerabilities that are\nactually being confirmed to have an exploit. And all of this link will be\navailable in the PDF and in the website. So you can actually play with this\ndata set and see and dig a little bit more into these data sets. Now the\npopularity of an exploitation, we can see the numbers of link available\nthroughout several platforms.\n31:53\nMicrosoft, Oracle with Log four J, Debian, Apache, Red Hats, the top\nexploited operating system are actually the one that have the majority of\nvulnerability at scale across various data sets. And then if we take high\nPSS and the previous data sets we can see that out of all the GitHub\nexploits available, just a fraction of them are actually available and\nactually exploited in the world. And if we take the same information\naround EPSs and CISA Kev, we can see again a fractional, a very finite\nnumber of those are available. The reason why we take EPSs above 0.6 or\n0.7 is because those are the factors that we consider to have the\nvulnerability more exploited at scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e32:49\nAnd then we have a certain division above, basically the 0.7 where the\nmajority of EPSs are at, but is even a further refinement of all the\nvulnerability available. And if you can see a lot of the vulnerability, up to\n94% are scoring a value that is 0.11% or 0.1% of likelihood of exploitation\nin the wild. So this enable us to really focus on the vulnerabilities that\nactually really matters. Now, Sisakev also has published a top routinely\nexploited vulnerability. I\u0026rsquo;m going to go a little bit faster on this element\nwhere we can. See the top twelve vulnerability exploited in the wild at\nscale. And you can see again these data sets available. Recently Sisa Kev\nhas also crossed two projects together that is basically number of\nvulnerability exploited between the sysercave entry and used by\nRansomware.\n34:00\nAnd again in here we don\u0026rsquo;t see a lot of surprises. So Microsoft is the one\nthat has the biggest attack surface overall, hence why they\u0026rsquo;re being\ntargeted by the exploit. Now I want to rephrase and I want to refresh the\nconcept that a lot of this information can be automated and can become\nthe probability of exploitation together with location that enables you to\nfocus on the 0.1% or even less if you consider business location. Business\ncontext and location. That leads you to a 0.1% of the total number of\nvulnerability that you have to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e34:37\nSo to wrap it up, the data set to consider are EPSs for the probability of\nexploitation, CTI against a bit more refined CTI to actually look at the\nlikelihood of exploitation, elements that are used in ransomware from the\nCISA cave database, location of an asset for the likelihood of exploitation\nand the reachability from network, as well as the type of vulnerability.\nNow, how easy is to deploy an exploit? The element you should consider is\nthe popularity of an exploit. So how widespread is that exploit? How\nlikely? And how many times is this exploit used at scale? If it\u0026rsquo;s widely\navailable, if it\u0026rsquo;s been verified, or if there is a module that actually for this\nparticular exploit to be deployed, and again, exploit being using the wild\nleveraging EPSs or your CTI data, and you can see the various module.\n35:37\nWe did also analysis on the top twelve and the methodology of attack from\nthe top vulnerability exploited last year. And as you can see, remote code\nexecution is the one that is most used because logically those vulnerability\nare easier to implement and easy to weaponize at scale, either if you use\nransomware or if you do a specific targeted attack. Now, I want to cover\nin the last five minutes a couple of edge cases where some of this\ninformation might or might not be useful. So EPSs tend to have a 16 to 30\ndays synchronization effect with new vulnerability at scale. So if we take\nOpenSSL vulnerability that was mentioned at the beginning of this year,\ntemporary had a 4.5, ended up being very high for a specific amount of\nperiod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e36:32\nBut EPSs code was super low for a long time, while the CTI interest for\ntargeted and refined CTI information was really high because of the\ndistribution across number of systems available. So it was something that\nattacker really looked into. Another vulnerability that later on got really\nattention and got really exploited at scale was VMware or QNAP systems\nbecause those vulnerability got a lot of attention from Ransomware\nperspective. Original CBS 8.8 a lot of high interest from CTI. Again EPSs\nvery low and it ended up catching up later stage. So those are cases and\ncaveat when using CTI versus EPSs that there is a little bit of a delay\nbetween when a vulnerability get published and when a vulnerability get\nexploited at scale. So to wrap it up, you can get information around\nlikelihood of exploitation in comparison with EPSs.\n37:46\nWhen EPSs is low, always double check if the vulnerability widespread. If\nthere are a number of systems, for example in Shodan or Gray Noise that\nare highly exploited or highly available, or shadow servers is another good\ndata source of information as well as hacker one data and other bug\nbounty data to see fundamentally if that vulnerability is exploited in the\nwild. We have a lot of this information under exploitability and probability\nof exploitation and the popularity in Phoenix Security to actually enable\nyou to do this at scale and the least, but not last. You can see the\nmethodology of attack like CWE Capex. This becomes a little bit more\ncomplex to dig into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e38:35\nSo I want to conclude that vulnerability at scale tend to be a tunnel and\nvery hard and very heavy to explore and dig into, but there is a light at the\nend of the tunnel. To summarize manual triage is not practical, it\u0026rsquo;s not\neffective. EPSs is a great source for prioritization context, location and\nother factors can help further down refining the vulnerability exploitation\nand the one you should focus on and risk enable us to talk with the\nbusiness in a better way. And if we identify the single thread of risk to\nvulnerability, we can enable the business to communicate and to connect\nwith the majority of people. Now, I want to leave with a last comment,\nthat is this is what we do at scale with Phoenix Security.\n39:34\nWe are a data driven company that use a lot of detail set to actually\ncontextualize, prioritize and deliver high quality feed to engineer at scale.\nYou can find us on Phoenix Security and a lot of these data sets are\navailable. We love the community. So we made available a version of\nPhoenix Security with OWASP and you can get access to the Phoenix\nSecurity edition from Oasp using this QR code that you have available in\nhere. A lot of these data sets and a lot of this information are actually also\navailable on some of the write up and the publication that we did around\nvulnerability management at scale and Application Security program at\nscale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e40:19\nYou can find them using the QR code as well as the new tool publication\nthat we did around the use of SLA and how to move away from SLA and\ninto a more data driven and risk approach. Again, the QR code will lead\nyou to the specific page or building a resilient application security and\ncloud security program using this QR code. We also discuss around this\nparticular topic on the podcast CSCP or Cybersecurity and Cloud podcast\nwith a lot of thought leadership around the world. So I\u0026rsquo;d like to thank\neveryone for your time and effort. And I want to thank all our defender for\nactually defending and helping our business to get up to date and safe\nevery day. It\u0026rsquo;s not an easy job, and we\u0026rsquo;re here to help you all to get less\nburnout and more focus. Thank you very much.\n41:19\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to open the floor to the question.

Hi. Welcome to this open security summit session in October 2023.\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;re joined by Simon Wardley and Marius Poskus. You know, has to\nbe one of my favorite topics, especially, I have to say, the thing I\u0026rsquo;ve learned\nthe most in the last 510 years that changed my perception. I have to add\nGen AI to that now. I have to say, Simon, but, you know, I still feel that it\u0026rsquo;s\none of those unexplored areas that has so much that we need to do to\nfigure out how to really use it. And it\u0026rsquo;s not perfect, but it\u0026rsquo;s way better than\na lot of the things that we use. So big fan on worldly maps. So, Simon, I\nknow you got some things you want to present to us. Why don\u0026rsquo;t we start\nthere and then we start the Q A out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 00:49\nWe can do perfectly. Happy to. I put some slides together because we\u0026rsquo;re\ntalking about weak cycles. But before you\u0026rsquo;ve already dropped the Gen AI\nbomb in here, I\u0026rsquo;ve got to say, the difference between Chat GPT Four and\nthe multimodal version of Chat GTP, the more visual version, is night and\nday. It\u0026rsquo;s enormous. It\u0026rsquo;s astronomical. Because part of the problem is this\ngoes back to the concepts of NICUs negropants and architecture by\nyourself. So the process of design is conversation going on between two\ndesigners, or possibly within the mind of one designer, two identities. But\nit\u0026rsquo;s a conversation. But that conversation in text form was very much\nlimited by rules and syntax and styles. And of course, this goes all the way\nback to Jonah Friedman\u0026rsquo;s work on graphical conversation theory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 01:53\nGetting into that graphical form, it\u0026rsquo;s now much more about objects and\nrelationships and context. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit like when you\u0026rsquo;re coding how we often\nhave whiteboards behind us to actually explain the problem on the\nwhiteboard that we then code. Well, we\u0026rsquo;ve been trapped in that world of\ncode, the world of storytelling and text and all the rest of it. But the new\nversion of Chat sheet, it is totally. This is what I\u0026rsquo;ve been waiting for. I\nwrote a post on this back in May last, earlier this year, which was\nfollowing one from previously. The fuss about conversational\nprogramming, the medium is so important. So it\u0026rsquo;s enormous. If you\nhaven\u0026rsquo;t played with the multimodal form, I can throw maps in there, get it\nto interpret the map. I can have a discussion with it, build a bet. It\u0026rsquo;s just\nincredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 02:44\nSo I would argue that\u0026rsquo;s another pivotal point. But for me, the bit that it\nwas already doing, which was the big game changer, was a understanding\ncontext. So I can have a dialogue with it, but more importantly is the\nability to translate that into a context that I give it. So, for example, the\nbiggest problem I had in the past was how do I tell that story in a way that\nmakes sense to that individual, for that culture, for that experience in a\nway to even at the point of the journey, that individual is that could never\nscale. Now we can now we can tell the story and make sure the story is\ncoherent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 03:19\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to disagree with you here. Good on a panel is that beforehand\nwere talking about styles and rules and syntax and basically giving orders.\nSo it was like, I need to improve this code, et cetera. And were still\ntrapped in that world of text. I think what we\u0026rsquo;ve got with the multimodal\nforms enable us to ask questions in a completely different way and it is a\nhuge transit. So everything before they release the multimodal version, I\nthink will be forgotten to history. I mean, it was sort of exciting. This is\nwhere it\u0026rsquo;s actually game on. This is where it really is a fundamental\nchange and it\u0026rsquo;s the medium by which we can have the conversation. But\nanyway, I\u0026rsquo;ve got some slight and weak signals. Well, on mapping, because\nI have to talk about mapping, of course, intelligence and.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 04:14\nConnecting the dots, right, and providing context, right. For example, just\nmaybe so we can tide a lot of this on mapping, threat intelligence and that\nsituation awareness. My challenge a lot in the past was how do I translate\nthe situation awareness that we have here to that target audience? And\neven with the map, right, even when I got a map, I was able to create\nanalysis. So I was always being very frustrated because I could use maps, I\ncould visualize in maps, I could think in maps. I always struggle to\ncommunicate those stories and to provided that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 04:50\nAnd now I can see how I can do that in a way that leads the individual\nalmost to they\u0026rsquo;ll be consuming the worldly maps, and then as they ask the\nquestions, you can zoom in and go, oh, let me show you what actually\nhappens behind the scenes. Where in the past, there was too much of a\nchasm there on that part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 05:10\nOkay, I\u0026rsquo;m going to agree and I\u0026rsquo;m going to explain why I agree as well. But\nwe\u0026rsquo;ll get there. I\u0026rsquo;m going to share some slides. I\u0026rsquo;ve always got a current\nresearch project while I\u0026rsquo;ve got one going on in video gaming. Coming up.\nDid sustainability. I did cybersecurity. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll spend a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 05:30\nTaking yes, my ass before, because you\u0026rsquo;ve done a lot of great work and I\njoined a couple, but I know if you finish it off, it\u0026rsquo;d be great to see the\noutcome of that research project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 05:38\nOh, it\u0026rsquo;s not written up yet. The time between when the research project\nfinishes me right up is quite some time because I\u0026rsquo;ve got but I will show\nyou. I will show you. All right, let\u0026rsquo;s get started. Anyway. Too much chatting\nfor me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 05:54\nCan you see that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 05:55\nOkay, yes, we can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 05:56\nRight? So let me go view full screen mode. Okay. So very quickly, I\u0026rsquo;m\ngoing to talk about origin, how I got into maps, and that\u0026rsquo;s going to be\nsuper quick. And then I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about patterns, and then I\u0026rsquo;m going\nto talk about the problems with weak signals. Okay? So for me, this all\nstarted running a company, didn\u0026rsquo;t know what I was doing, completely\nclueless. Ended up reading Sun Tzu\u0026rsquo;s The Art of War. So Sun Tzu taught\nabout five factors mattering, competition, have a purpose and moral\nimperative. Understand your landscape, the environment you\u0026rsquo;re competing\nin. Understand the climatic patterns, so how the landscape is changing.\nUnderstand doctrine. So the principles of organization. Then you\u0026rsquo;re into\ngameplay. And this overlaps very nicely with John Boyd\u0026rsquo;s UDA loop. You\u0026rsquo;ve\ngot the game. You observe the environment. That\u0026rsquo;s what landscaping\nclimatic patterns are about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 06:50\nThen you orientate yourself around this space and then you\u0026rsquo;re into sort of\naction, or decision action. This is where you\u0026rsquo;re into the whole sort of\nleadership part. And this got me really into landscape. What do we mean\nby landscape? So that got me into maps. And I read loads on military\nhistory and all the rest of it, things like this. And I got really excited by\nmaps. And so I asked my company, everybody who was working for me,\ngive me your maps. And they gave me loads of maps, customer journey\nmaps, my maps, systems maps, loads of them, business process maps. And\nI took one systems map. Here it is. A number of components connected by\nconnections. Took one component, CRM, moved it and asked, how has the\nmap changed? And the answer is, it hasn\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 07:40\nWhich is unusual because if I took a geographic map and I take a map of\nthe world and move, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, Australia, put it next to the UK.\nObviously that has changed. It hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed here because it\u0026rsquo;s not a map,\nit\u0026rsquo;s a graph. And so the thing that every single map I had in common was\nnone of them were actually maps, they were all graphs. And just to explain\nthe difference there very quickly, the three images at the top, they\u0026rsquo;re all\ngraphs. Three places nottingham, London, Dover, connected by two roads,\nm one, M two. Roughly, they\u0026rsquo;re all identical. The three images underneath\nit are all maps, and they are completely different. And the reason why they\nare completely different is because of a compass, because that gives a\nproperty, and that property is it gives space meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 08:31\nSo the difference between a graph and a map is in a map, the space has\nmeaning. So you can\u0026rsquo;t just simply move a component and it remains the\nsame just because the connections are the same. So that\u0026rsquo;s the distinction\nbetween a graph and a map, and space only has meaning. Well, obviously,\nwhen you\u0026rsquo;re mapping against some form of landscape. Now, in order to do\nthis, you need three basic components. Anchor, such as magnetic north,\nposition of pieces. This is north, southeast or west of that, and consistency\nof movement. So if I go north. If I go south. And so that\u0026rsquo;s where I started.\nAnd the example I always do is a tea shop. If you\u0026rsquo;re mapping a tea shop,\nyou start what\u0026rsquo;s the anchor? The public consuming tea, the business who\nwants to sell cups of tea, right? Well, that\u0026rsquo;s anchors that\u0026rsquo;s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 09:18\nNot enough cup of tea has needs. It needs tea. Cup needs hot water, Ketle,\npower. So you\u0026rsquo;ve got a chain of needs that describes position through a\nconcept of visibility. And then of course, all of these components are\nevolving. And so that gives you movement and evolution. And so this is\nwhat you end up with is a map. And in this map, if you move a piece, it\nfundamentally changes the meaning of a map of the map, because it\u0026rsquo;s a\nmap. There we are. That\u0026rsquo;s super simple. All right? Patterns. Turns out\nwhen you start mapping out spaces, you learn lots of patterns. There are\nclimactic patterns. There\u0026rsquo;s doctrine, which is about organizational\npatterns. There\u0026rsquo;s leadership patterns. There\u0026rsquo;s about 30 Climactic patterns,\n40 doctrine, about 100 different forms of gameplay. All right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 10:07\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about Climactic patterns and then bring in weak\nsignals into this. So the climactic patterns here\u0026rsquo;s the horrible list that I\u0026rsquo;m\ngoing to talk about is everything evolves through supply and demand.\nCompetition components can coevolve. Higher order systems create new\nsources of value. Efficiency enables innovation. Success breeds inertia\nvery simple patterns that come out of mapping, which you can apply to a\nmap. So an example, this is compute roughly in 2004 using these\napplication. Best coding practice on a runtime on operating system or best\narchitectural practice on compute. That was 2004. The first pattern you\nlearn is everything evolved. So we knew that it would eventually become a\nutility. Sure enough. AWS Et Two 2006 the next pattern you learn is past.\nSuccess breeds inertia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 10:59\nSo all of those with big data centers and lots of practices in that space had\ninertia to the change. Perfectly normal. The next pattern you learn is that\nas underlying components evolve, you get a change of practice. So we go\nfrom high meantime to recovery, to low meantime to recovery. So we go\nfrom scale up to scale out. We go from disaster recovery to chaos engines.\nSo we\u0026rsquo;re distributing systems now. We\u0026rsquo;re using chaos engines. We\u0026rsquo;re no\nlonger doing things like capacity planning. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to do that\nanymore. We\u0026rsquo;re not having to do N plus one anymore, all those sorts of\nthings. Okay, the next pattern you learn oh, and those new practices, we\ngave a word we called DevOps eventually. Efficiency enables innovation.\nStandard pattern commodogation. So as things become a commodity, you\nget the appearance of new things like Netflix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 11:57\nHigher order systems create new sources of value or worth basic standard\npatterns useful for investment. So when I look at a map, I can basically\nsee what\u0026rsquo;s changing. I can go where we should invest and also where we\nshould not invest. So existing practices and servers in the data center and\nit\u0026rsquo;s simply by using this map more complicated version. This is how at\nUbuntu we attacked the market. We were like 3% the operating system\nagainst Red Hat, Microsoft, they had all the money, all the people and\neverything else. Took us 18 months. We took 70% of all cloud. Not\nbecause we\u0026rsquo;re genius, we just knew where to attack. Really simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 12:36\nAll right, so when it comes to weak signals, there are a whole bunch of\nthings you\u0026rsquo;re looking for when it comes to this particular set of patterns or\nthis sort of change, evolutionary change, past success, breeding inertia,\nlots of people complain, dismissing the future system, high levels of\nefficiency of the future system. A new set of changing practices should be\nemerging which are associated with speed. You should see rapid\ninnovation with people built on top and those new systems creating value.\nAnd those are things that you can look for if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a change\nin the marketplace caused by climactic patterns. And a classic example of\nthis we saw in 2014. So by 2010, the emerging practice got new name\nDevOps. By 2014, the runtime further up the stack started become more\nof a utility and it had exactly those patterns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 13:31\nWhich is why in 2014, you should note, should have known AWS Lambda\nwas going to become huge. This is where we need to go much more into\nthe serverless space. Which is why your strategy should have changed\nbecause everything underneath it eventually is now heading towards the\nnew legacy. Your strategy in 2016 is completely different from what it was\nin 2008. Your focus should have been on serverless, the emerging practice,\net cetera. And that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re seeing grow today. All perfectly standard.\nI just want to reiterate that your strategy in 2016 is totally different from\nwhat it is in 2008. And the guide to it should have been those signals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 14:13\nYou should have seen the efficiency, you should have seen people building\nthings rapidly on top, lots of inertia, lots of people resisting this change,\nthose practices associated with speed, rapid development of new things,\nwith new sources of value, et cetera, they\u0026rsquo;re all the sort of signals that you\nlook for. So you can read more about that in a wonderful book called The\nFly will Affect by Dave Anderson. And then you get to another set patterns,\nleadership. So let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at those. There\u0026rsquo;s a whole bunch of them\nwhich we\u0026rsquo;re not going to go through except for one. Sensing engine is a\nparticular model called ILC. It\u0026rsquo;s a very simple model. You take something,\nyou turn it into a commodity, you expose it as an API so other people can\nbuild on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 15:00\nYou mine the metadata because they\u0026rsquo;re building on top of your API, so you\nhave to bill them. So you mine the billing data, see what is becoming\npopular. So you identify new components in that industrialized new\ncomponent services. The people you\u0026rsquo;ve just chewed up scream, oh, they\u0026rsquo;ve\neaten our business model. Everybody else cheers because they can more\nrapidly build new things. On top of that, it\u0026rsquo;s a very simple model. You get\neverybody else to innovate for you. You mine metadata to spot future\npatterns, you commoditize to component services. And the reason why you\nuse this model, it\u0026rsquo;s written back in I wrote it back in 2005, is now your\nrate of innovation, customer focus, efficiency, all increase with the size of\nthe ecosystem people building on top. You use it to climb up the stack on\nthe right hand side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 15:51\nSo you compute machine learning, engines, platforms, whatever it\nhappens to be, you\u0026rsquo;re building up on the right hand side of the stack. Now,\nyou\u0026rsquo;ll read about this in a book called Reaching Cloud Philosophy. AWS\u0026rsquo;s,\nsecond ever book. It\u0026rsquo;s got about 17 pages of mapping in there. It\u0026rsquo;s got the\nIRC model in there. Basically, it describes how they chew up industry after\nindustry. It\u0026rsquo;s very simple to spot. You look for certain patterns. So known\nfor providing components focused on enabling others to build harvesting\nof ecosystem, obsession with efficiency, obsession with customer focus,\nconsidered highly innovative, despite the fact they\u0026rsquo;re not doing any of it.\nRapid growth up the stack. So if you spot those particular signals, you\nknow somebody\u0026rsquo;s playing that game against you. Now, that\u0026rsquo;s one bunch of\nclimatic patterns and a bunch of signals associated that\u0026rsquo;s one specific\nleadership pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 16:46\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of signals associated with that. Of course, there\u0026rsquo;s a\nmassive amount to this field, but you can reapply this in other areas. So if\nI look at something, this is the automotive industry. This was done in 2015\nat DVLA, looking at how it was changing. So this was where it was going\nin 2025. Many, many things becoming much more commodity like\nincreasing use of intelligent agents, et cetera. You simply overlap China\u0026rsquo;s?\nGameplay? We see them doing exactly the same sort of game. Heavier\nfocus in terms of climbing up the stack, efficiency one side, they\u0026rsquo;re\nencouraging joint ventures and of course, accused of harvesting the\necosystem. It\u0026rsquo;s all the same thing. It\u0026rsquo;s basically a classic ALC model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 17:33\nAnd if you know that the bigger their ecosystem gets, the same with\nAmazon, the more innovative, efficient, customer focused they are, the\nmore impossible they are to play. There are ways of countering that, but at\nleast you know the game they\u0026rsquo;re playing, right? So now here\u0026rsquo;s the\nproblem. That\u0026rsquo;s all wonderful stuff, and there\u0026rsquo;s a wonderful book come\nout called Leading by Week Signals, which has loads of maps in there. It\u0026rsquo;s\nby Peter Gomez and Mark Lampert. So I\u0026rsquo;ve been having a look through\nthat. It\u0026rsquo;s got lots of forms of maps in there, but the problem with the book\nis it\u0026rsquo;s probably only got an audience of about a thousand people. The\nreason people is most people don\u0026rsquo;t understand their landscape. We\ncompete in multiple landscapes, not just territorial, but obviously\ntechnological, economic, social and political landscapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 18:22\nAnd if we just have a look at the economic and technological landscapes,\nwe have very poor understanding of the environment. We\u0026rsquo;ve seen this from\nall the problems we\u0026rsquo;ve had with supply chains in the economic space. So\nour first problem is we\u0026rsquo;ve got very poor awareness of the landscapes we\nare competing in. That\u0026rsquo;s assuming that we realize that we are actually\ncompeting in landscapes. But there\u0026rsquo;s a second problem, and for that, I\u0026rsquo;m\ngoing to share something else. Can you see a mirror board?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 18:58\nYes, I can. And that\u0026rsquo;s leading by week signals by Peter Gomez. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 19:04\nYes, it is. And Mark Lambert. So what I did is I took about 60, OD people\nwho are all so I run these groups where we look at an industry like\ndefense, like healthcare, like finance, education, and we try and map out\nthe space and understand what\u0026rsquo;s important, where to invest. And so we\ndid one on cybersecurity. So I took about 60, 70 people, all from different\nparts of cybersecurity. And the first thing we do is ask them what matters.\nAnd so they came up with a load of things that matters phishing attacks,\nsecurity target attacks, detection, disk, trust loads. All of this stuff\nmatters. All right, that\u0026rsquo;s great. How do we work out what of all of this\nstuff actually matters? Well, the first thing I ask them to do is group it into\nthemes, or what we call perspectives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 19:58\nAnd so they group this into things like risk management, security\nawareness, procurement, infrastructure, threat, identity, data, people, a\nbunch of different themes. And then what we do is we ask them self\norganizing to group map out the most of those themes. In fact, they\nchoose a number of them, I think it was about six. And they chose to map\nout people, technology advancements, risk management, security\nawareness, data and threat. Now, this is all done over a period of 10\nhours. And so what they do is they go and map out each of these areas.\nNow, why would you do that? You do that because I want you to imagine,\nyou want to find out what are the most important landmarks in, say, Paris.\nBut no one\u0026rsquo;s ever been to Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 20:47\nSo you send one group out there to map Paris, and they come back with a\nmap. They\u0026rsquo;ve obviously mapped it from a perspective how do you know\nthe map\u0026rsquo;s right? It\u0026rsquo;s wrong. They might have mapped it from the\nperspective of the nicest places to buy pizza. And so they will say the\nnumber one place is Pierre\u0026rsquo;s Pizza Parlor. Okay, fine. So what you do is\nyou send multiple groups out to map it from different perspectives, and\nthen you can ask the question, what are the most important landmarks\nacross multiple maps? And then you can aggregate that together. So this is\nwhat they did they went through as a group, they map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 21:22\nOut their particular overall and now he\u0026rsquo;s going through the sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 21:29\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all right. Does that make sense, by the way?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 21:31\nYeah, no, it\u0026rsquo;s really good. No, exactly. I was just seeing your praises here,\nbut keep going. I unclick the mute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 21:40\nHey, no problem at all. So they map out things like cybersecurity from the\nperspective of people. So they\u0026rsquo;ve added a whole bunch of components in\nhere and they\u0026rsquo;re looking at things like risk management, total\nstakeholders, assets, situational awareness, protection, et cetera. And then\nthey do it from all of these. So they\u0026rsquo;re broken into different groups. We\nrun this all in parallel. So you\u0026rsquo;ve got one group down here who was\nmapping it from the point of view of awareness, and one group who are\nmapping over here from the point of view of risk management. Now, you\ncan see they circle around this area because that\u0026rsquo;s when we ask the\nquestion. Once they\u0026rsquo;ve got a map and they\u0026rsquo;ve got embedded in their\nperspective of the landscape, we ask them the question, what matters?\nOkay, where should we invest?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 22:27\nAnd get them to highlight the most important area. So, from the\nperspective of cybersecurity risk management, they highlighted things like\nbetter risk analysis skills, LLM data. Now, that\u0026rsquo;s not that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:40\nSorry, can you just zoom in? Because I think that one for me has one of\nthe best examples of why LLM is going to completely make a massive\nchange in our industry. So let\u0026rsquo;s zoom out a little bit. Sorry. So you can see\nwhat we\u0026rsquo;ve done here, if you look at it, is that you basically have multiple\nelements of the cybersecurity industry, right. From a risk point of view.\nRight. And then the interesting argument was you see that LLMs in the\nbottom right? Kind of they\u0026rsquo;re allowed the LLMs that it\u0026rsquo;s allowed on the\nbottom right. Yeah. Your mouse. The argument were talking about was\nthat before Shi GPT, that was all the way to the left, right? So for me, it\u0026rsquo;s\na great example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 23:25\nI\u0026rsquo;ve used it several times to explain why sometimes things change\novernight or change very quickly, is because that LLMs before track GPT.\nAnd you probably can argue, maybe even now with the visual element, the\nmultimodal was kind of to the left. Now that it\u0026rsquo;s there, it means that all\nthose security LLMs, which are pretty primitive, are going to go very fast.\nIn the past, I almost sometimes view this as gravity, right? In the past, the\nsecurity LLMs struggle to move to the right because they were anchored\nby the LLMs Foundation. That was, in a way, on Genesis. Now that the\nLLMs are getting close to commodity or very productized, they\u0026rsquo;re going to\npull, right? The gravity is going to pull all the security LLMs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 24:08\nAnd if you\u0026rsquo;re one of those guys at the top, in a way, you either embrace\nthat and then your strategy should be changing because you\u0026rsquo;d know the\nsecurity alms are going to move all the way to the right very quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 24:21\nSo one way to test whether that is true is going all the way back to the\nweak signals in here. And here we have our pattern, things industrialized.\nSo are you seeing lots of signs of inertia because of past success in\nprevious ways of doing it? Are you seeing this as an evolutionary change\nassociated with efficiency? So is that going on? Are you seeing a change of\npractice associated with speed? Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s got new terms like prompt\nengineering or whatever. Are you seeing rapid innovation built on top with\nnew sources of value being created? Because if you are, then you know\nthis is the stage that you\u0026rsquo;re actually at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 25:00\nYeah, well, I guess the answer to every one of those is check. Right? And I\nthink the thing that I found most fascinating is the inertia. I have to say\nthat I see so many people, even companies or individuals, that I could\ntotally see the inertia because I could see that they look for the flaws and\ngoing, oh, that\u0026rsquo;s not why it\u0026rsquo;s relevant. And I\u0026rsquo;m like I have this analogy of\ntalking to somebody, saying it\u0026rsquo;s like Jarvis, right? You know, iron man\njarvis. That we have Jarvis. And people now say he\u0026rsquo;s not good enough.\nBecause when we asked Jarvis to sing, he didn\u0026rsquo;t do a good job. Or we ask\nhim to do hallucinates. Jarvis hallucinates. Yeah, but what do we think\ninnovation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 25:39\nIs other than a hallucination? I mean, hallucination is not a bug, it\u0026rsquo;s a\nfeature. But anyway exactly. Now, anyway, we do this across all of these\ndifferent maps and then what you do is you\u0026rsquo;ve now got multiple\nperspectives. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got in total, here we are, nice little summary\ndiagram. We got six different perspectives. Data organization,\ncybersecurity in the perspective of awareness from risk management. And\non each of these maps now, the group have highlighted what\u0026rsquo;s important.\nSo with people regenerative culture, regenerative supply chain, these are\nthe words that they use. Risk management skills, better risk analysis,\nsecurity awareness, et cetera. They\u0026rsquo;ve highlighted the most important\nareas. And then what we do is we aggregate across the lot. Okay? So it\u0026rsquo;s a\nsimple task and bring it all together, aggregation. And then by finding\nthemes which are most common, you create a priority list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 26:43\nAnd it turns out that your priority list in cybersecurity is about building a\nresilient culture. That the top four things seem to be about building a\nresilient culture. Rapid growth of AI, cyber immunity, I. E. Organizations\nconstantly attacking themselves and getting used to being attacked in\norder to harden themselves up and learning. So you end up with these sort\nof core themes, which then what we do is we go and do an examination of\nwhat\u0026rsquo;s going on in the wider space. This is by comparing analysts against\nwhat the actual group comes up with and what we discover is that the\nanalysts are mostly focused on process automation, continuous\nmonitoring, digital sovereignty, nation state, god knows why. They get\nexcited by that sort of stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 27:34\nWhereas the group itself was more about resilient culture, cyber immunity,\nrapid growth of AI, and actually awareness of the supply chain\nmanagement. You got to learn about that sort of stuff. So this is where\nSpons and all the rest of it come into play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 27:48\nCould you just explain me better, Mark, how to read this? So what does\nthe colors it will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 27:56\nBe when I write it up. So the yellow dots is I aggregate a whole bunch of\nanalyst reports and run them through the same process so I can see what\nthey think is high priority, what they think is low priority. The purple dots\nare where the group was. And then what I do is also I take the entire list\nand I send it through Chat, GPT and Bard because they\u0026rsquo;re trained on\nlarge sets of data, so they give me a sort of background signal of what the\ngeneral market feels. So I ask Chat, GPT and Bard to order them as well.\nAnd so that\u0026rsquo;s the red and the blue. So the ones you concentrate really on\nare the yellow and the purple. And you can see there\u0026rsquo;s quite a big\ndistinction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 28:36\nSo the only area that the group agreed with the analysts on was the rapid\ngrowth of AI. That was the only space. Otherwise there\u0026rsquo;s quite a big\ndistinction between what they thought was important. Now, the reason\nwhy I mentioned this is because you think about resilient culture, cyber\nimmunity. So it\u0026rsquo;s about making your organization capable of coping with\nshocks and being constantly under attack. So improving its hardness to\nthose sorts of shocks. I mean, those are obvious sort of things, but that\u0026rsquo;s\nnot what was being mentioned in the analyst report. And I think it was the\nnext day, I think, Denise, it was either yourself or with another group. This\nwhole conversation, this ridiculous idea there was a CISO quite proudly\nshowing off a board of shame that they were using in their organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 29:27\nSo they would do phishing attacks and everybody failed, went on the\nboard of shame, which is almost the reverse. This is not how you build a\nresilient culture or build up cyber immunity. This is actually how you\ndismantle any form of culture that you have within that organization. You\ncreate a system of fear and it\u0026rsquo;s almost the reverse of what you want to do.\nSo this leads me to the second problem, because the first problem is that\nwe don\u0026rsquo;t understand our landscapes anyway. So the weak signal stuff is\nreally exciting. I\u0026rsquo;d love it, but for most people it\u0026rsquo;s fairly irrelevant because\nwe don\u0026rsquo;t actually understand our landscapes. And the second problem we\nhave is the utter idiocy that we do in places, even basic things like how we\nbuild resilient cultures, which obviously should be a focus, I\u0026rsquo;m afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 30:18\nIn some places, we\u0026rsquo;re not even doing that at that point, I\u0026rsquo;ll go quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 30:25\nSo how do you measure that? Because I have to say, one of the\nfrustrations that I feel we still have this is a good one to bring Mario\u0026rsquo;s on\nthis is that I still feel that a lot of security, it\u0026rsquo;s still a marketing exercise.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ll give you an example. Imagine three organizations. One has that\nCISO, one has maybe the other extreme super more enlightened. And I\ncompletely agree that\u0026rsquo;s what not to do. By the way, one has great\npractices responding quite well, and then one in the middle. At the\nmoment, we don\u0026rsquo;t have a good way to let the market promote and reward\nthe good player.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 31:12\nYeah, I think you\u0026rsquo;re very right. I think it all stems from what Simon\nmentioned about the culture. I think loads of organizations are still\ncarrying that legacy view of security, saying no security being stick instead\nof a carrot. So I\u0026rsquo;m always the kind of person that always thinks about\nhow we can communicate and collaborate with people to actually help\nthem understand how the security work. Like phishing simulations. It\u0026rsquo;s\nnever a blame culture. It\u0026rsquo;s always about how you encourage people to\nreport bad behavior because you build a two way collaboration. You\nalways encourage instead of noticing someone who failed you\u0026rsquo;re, noticing\npeople who might detect the emails and praising people for their good\nwork. That\u0026rsquo;s how you breed. I think the culture sort of spin. We never say\nno. And that\u0026rsquo;s one other thing. We actually talked within my team last\nweek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 32:25\nWhen did the last time we said no to someone in security? And we couldn\u0026rsquo;t\nremember. We never say no. We always say yes. But let\u0026rsquo;s look at from\nsecurity perspective, what do we need to be able to say? Yo, yes. For\nexample, what are requirements of security to be able to say yes? And\nthat\u0026rsquo;s how we always we\u0026rsquo;re always playing around availability and\nsecurity. Because I think sometimes people forget there\u0026rsquo;s loads of\norganizations that add security for the sake of security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 32:55\nCan I just say I love that? Absolutely love that. Thank you. Back in the\n1990s, I used to run security for an organization called Harrods, which\nobviously as in the It security. And one of the things I would do is attack\nthe organization. Of course, when we found weaknesses, rather than go\nround them, because unfortunately, there was a big culture of fear in that\norganization. Rather than go around, beat people up, we\u0026rsquo;d involve them in\nthe group to do the next round of attacks. Because you\u0026rsquo;d learn from the\nprocess. So it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a case of go and hit somebody with a stick, put them\non a wall of god, I can\u0026rsquo;t believe in 2023 somebody puts up a wall of\nshame. I mean, that\u0026rsquo;s just anyway, I love hearing the words that you were\nsaying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 33:46\nYeah, it\u0026rsquo;s always either involvement or another thing that really helps. I\nthink for us is make it personable. Whenever we have examples of safe\nphishing, we always trying to relate examples of various banking scams,\nSMS scams that we find in the wild and how it relates to people\u0026rsquo;s, external\nfamilies, external sort of known people circle, and how we can relate. That\nhow you\u0026rsquo;re enhancing your security knowledge, not only for the job you\ndo, but your personal life, how you protect your personal bank details,\nyour personal money and personal details, as in what can be used for\nnefarious purposes. So I think when you connect those two dots, it always\nsort of a big light bulb goes up in sort of people\u0026rsquo;s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 34:33\nBut we need a way to share this information. And I think a really good\nsign is a sign that the insurance industry is really raising the bar because\nthey got burned quite spectacularly by distributing insurance as confetti\nfor a while and then got burned right. Because they were not evaluating\ncorrectly the security posture. And now they\u0026rsquo;re starting to put pressure.\nAnd even if you look at that simple example, which I would argue, it\u0026rsquo;s\nalmost like if they don\u0026rsquo;t have the awareness to understand why that\u0026rsquo;s a\nproblem, we can bet that there\u0026rsquo;s going to be another 40 things they\u0026rsquo;re\ngoing to be doing wrong. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like the canary on the coal mine. But\nwe need a way to expose that. We need a way for the market to become\nmore efficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 35:15\nIn fact, we need a way for the senior management to understand that\u0026rsquo;s\nwhat\u0026rsquo;s happening and the need. Right? And maybe the senior management\nloves it. Great. And maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a cultural problem within the organization.\nOkay? Right. There\u0026rsquo;s a moment where you draw the line a bad company is\ngoing to be a bad company. Right. But it might not be that their customers\nare that happy with it\u0026rsquo;s. Kind of like pollution. Right? So in a weird way,\nwe now have very little acceptance for companies that claim all sorts of\nthings and behind the scenes they polluting like mad and they\u0026rsquo;re\ndestroying environments and they have really bad ethical practices. I think\nwe need a way and I think Maps is part of the solution. I think Maps is one\nof the ways this can work quite effectively and also translating it to\nparticular audiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 35:59\nSo you reward the teams that are doing a good job, the teams that build a\ngood culture. If anything, Mares is giving us better arguments when we\njustify why we do certain things. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 36:10\nYeah, I think I\u0026rsquo;m a big proponent as well. Sometimes people forget that\nsecurity is part of the business. We need to align security to business. How\ncomes some of the security professionals, when you talk, when you ask for\na security professional, how does your security program help your\nbusiness? Bottom line, they always get mind boggled. Oh, bottom line is\nnot our concern. But that\u0026rsquo;s the thing. How do we build accountability?\nHow do we make people understand what security is all about. That\u0026rsquo;s one\nthing that is always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:45\nI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 36:46\nGuess it\u0026rsquo;s not portrayed very well because sometimes people hide behind\naccountability and that\u0026rsquo;s what needs to change, I guess, as our industry\nmatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:58\nBut then we are the problem, right? The security professional is the\nproblem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 37:02\nSome of them, yes, some of them are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:06\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s maps. What I like about, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep throwing\nthe other lens into this. I think we can scale that now in ways that before\nwhereas it\u0026rsquo;s not possible I think it\u0026rsquo;s now possible to take a map, a\nvisualization of practices that a company is doing, and provide narratives\nthat are anchored in a way I bias throws a particular way that we can\nthen get some good data on the back of it and going, that\u0026rsquo;s okay. That\u0026rsquo;s\nnot okay. I\u0026rsquo;m telling you, I have that problem. I have freaking suppliers\ncoming out of every bed of the organization and it\u0026rsquo;s going to go even more\nbecause we\u0026rsquo;re going to get a marketplace, right? So I really want to make\nsure that I can push security down and understand the metrics in my, for\nexample, third party supply environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:58\nSo how can we scale that, Simon? How can I get I will put a policy that\nsays I want every team to give me a worldly map of security, of how you\noperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 38:10\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not just an organization in terms of a company problem. This is a\nmassive problem from a.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:15\nNation state, but let\u0026rsquo;s solve an organization problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 38:21\nBut a classic example of this, one of the best I\u0026rsquo;ve seen, it\u0026rsquo;s not a map, it\u0026rsquo;s a\ngraph is the work which was done by the Complexity Group in Vienna for\nHungary. So what they did is they took VAT transaction. You know,\nwhenever you transact with someone else, there\u0026rsquo;s value added tax and\nHungary collects them at transaction level. So they were able to graph out\nthe entire economy, which is amazing. And what they found is there were\n90,000 old companies, and I think it was about 100 companies\nrepresented about 70% of the systemic risk of the entire economy. And it\nwas something like about 30 companies were about 25% or something. So\nany one of those 30 having a problem, you lose 25% of your GDP. But\nmost companies have that terrifying thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:12\nMost companies are like that. In fact, I would argue that most internal\nsystems are like that. The challenge is, in fact, I had this exact\nconversation with my team a couple of weeks ago where we had a big\nincident and we\u0026rsquo;re now mapping, for example, which parts of the\norganization that we going to leave to burn, which parts well, in a nice\nway, but which parts we\u0026rsquo;re going to run straight away. Because those are\nthe 20% that keep the stores open, right? They are the 20% that if they are\nalive, we can deal with the rest. Okay? But if they have a freaking heart\nattack, then we have a problem. No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 39:49\nGo ahead, Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 39:49\nWell, I was going to say if you think about the Hungary example, other\nnations can\u0026rsquo;t do that. The UK, we don\u0026rsquo;t collect transaction level VAT\nrecords. France won\u0026rsquo;t do so until 2030. So they\u0026rsquo;re operating in spaces\nwhere they do not understand their landscape. So you cannot see the\npattern. So we get hit by shops all the time and yes, absolutely, it\u0026rsquo;s true\nwith organization. This is why things like Spom software bill and\nmaterials, okay, it only gets you to the point of graphing and there\u0026rsquo;s a\nworld of difference between when something\u0026rsquo;s a commodity and when it\u0026rsquo;s\ncustom built. So ideally we want to get to math, but we\u0026rsquo;re lacking the\nbasic information. This is why the Typhoon this was about weak signals.\nWeak signals. It\u0026rsquo;s like Irobot, we\u0026rsquo;re like hacker, bloke blah. That\u0026rsquo;s great,\nbut it\u0026rsquo;s fantasy for most people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 40:37\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s fantasy because they don\u0026rsquo;t even have the basic understanding of\nthe landscape. And even more terrifying, they\u0026rsquo;re not even doing the basic\nsimple things of building resilient cultures within what they\u0026rsquo;ve got already.\nSo there\u0026rsquo;s an awful lot of groundwork which is almost why Weak Signals\nis I love the topic, I love books like this. I think this book is great and\nthere\u0026rsquo;s some really good stuff and I can see but it\u0026rsquo;s a bit like how the\nanalysts always want to talk about nation state security. What\u0026rsquo;s the point\nif you don\u0026rsquo;t actually understand the landscape?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 41:09\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the thing, I don\u0026rsquo;t know why, but for some reason nowadays we keep\ntalking about tools, about innovation and about this new shiny blinker\n3000 that\u0026rsquo;s going to solve all our problems. But people keep forgetting\nwhy would you start talking about nation states if a script kitty can breach\nyour defenses? Because maybe you don\u0026rsquo;t have ten visibility in your assets.\nMaybe you don\u0026rsquo;t even started doing the basics. Like you don\u0026rsquo;t have your\ndata flow mapped and you don\u0026rsquo;t know where the data is going and where\nit\u0026rsquo;s stored, how some of your assets are managed from hardening\nperspective. That\u0026rsquo;s why I think in a way it sort of underlines the problem\nbecause what we spoke within when I was in Sansis or Network event\n2010s was all about reducing the likelihood of risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 41:57\nAnd I believe that 2020s are shaping now in saying we can\u0026rsquo;t reduce\nlikelihood anymore because it\u0026rsquo;s inevitable that something\u0026rsquo;s going to\nhappen. So let\u0026rsquo;s work on resilience how we can maintain business\noperations and reduce the impact of that cyber attack and let\u0026rsquo;s not focus\nabout likelihood anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 42:15\nLook, I argue that my job as a CISO is to allow the business to take risk.\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s my job. My job is to make sure the business takes the right\namount of risk with the right amount of understanding, with the right\namount of mitigations in a way that incidents don\u0026rsquo;t become crisis because\nthe business needs to operate at a level of risk. It happens all the time. We\nhave stores open, right? You can walk into a store, right? We don\u0026rsquo;t have\nmilitary guys at our stores. When you go and buy your vitamins, by the\nway, we have great new products, poland America. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 42:49\nBecause there\u0026rsquo;s a thing like if you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 42:50\nLook at the latest, very healthy, but a dude with the machine gun and a lot\nof security guards at the entrance is not going to really work very well.\nAlthough it might make it more secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 43:00\nIf you look at the latest Greg\u0026rsquo;s von de Gras book, he\u0026rsquo;s poised a very\nimportant question. Every year the cybersecurity budgets are getting\nbigger, but we\u0026rsquo;re not getting less breaches. We\u0026rsquo;re getting more breaches\nevery year while we\u0026rsquo;re spending more on cybersecurity. So there is a\nfundamental yeah, but.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 43:21\nWe also have a lot more interconnectivity, right? Like, come on. If you look\nat the side effects of a cyber breach in 2023 versus 2020 or 2010, right?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s kind of like it\u0026rsquo;s very different, right? And there\u0026rsquo;s a lot I think hang on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 43:37\nYes, but remember, we also have very little understanding of the landscape\nitself. Most organized, very poor understanding of the space. And I think\nMarius is hitting on a really important point because from what came\nfrom that cybersecurity group was the critical things of the four things\nwas awareness, CPA, landscape supply chain, software bill and material\nsupply chain management was in that group of four. And rapid growth of\nAI. So that\u0026rsquo;s the technology thing. But the real two big ones were resilient\nculture and cyber immunity. And they\u0026rsquo;re about people, not about\ntechnology. So that\u0026rsquo;s about how you build a culture which copes with\nshocks and manages those shocks, and how you toughen up that culture\nso that people become sensitive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 44:23\nAnd this is why that whole sort of wall of shame thing is such a daft or\ncreating cultures of fear are so incredibly daft things to do. So,\nunfortunately, when I look at sort of the analyst reports, it\u0026rsquo;s a continuous\nmonitoring, it\u0026rsquo;s more analytics, more big data process, automation, big\none. Big one that\u0026rsquo;s all about technology. So I think there\u0026rsquo;s some\nfundamentals here in terms of we\u0026rsquo;ve got to focus on the people and\nbuilding a resilient culture and building that concept of cyber immunity\nwithin an organization. I think then, on top of that, we\u0026rsquo;ve got to improve\nour awareness. Then we can start talking about these wonderful new\nthings. I think the real danger is people say, oh, well, AI will magically\nsolve this. I\u0026rsquo;ve got to say, I\u0026rsquo;m gray. Maris on here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 45:08\nSort of the magical sort of like it is piece of data will magically do it.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve got to get back to fundamentals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 45:14\nAnd I think on the back of that simon I think the great point is the big\ntalent shortage is another bull because we all know to me personally as\nwell, yes, you need some of the skills in specific niches. But when you\nhiring security teams, most of the two of the most important skills for\nmyself is aptitude and attitude. You can teach the rest of them, but if\nsomeone has the right attitude and aptitude to learn, it will be very easy to\nget them and learn. The tech sometimes job descriptions and people hiring\nteams saying, oh, we don\u0026rsquo;t have specific talent shortage, I love that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 45:56\nAnd the reason why I love that, thank you so much for saying that, is\nbecause it\u0026rsquo;s often we\u0026rsquo;ve got a talent problem. It\u0026rsquo;s always the people are\nthe problem. No, the people are the solution. They\u0026rsquo;re your positive things,\nthey\u0026rsquo;re not the problem. They are where the answer actually is, we\u0026rsquo;ve got\nto change this sort of aspect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:19\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to do this quite a bit, right. And actually, Sam, I would\nlike your views on this. So I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of first of all, I completely agree.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t have a skills shortage. I think we have a skills transfer problem.\nRight. What we need to get into cybersecurity is a lot more people from\nother fields, because what they have is an attitude and a motivation and\nan understanding and a maturity that we don\u0026rsquo;t have right now. Right. The\nway I think about this is I can hire somebody, let\u0026rsquo;s say bands one to five,\nright? Five is top, one is lower. I can hire a cybersecurity analyst at band\nthree, which is actually quite expensive if you think about it. Right. And I\nwould argue today there\u0026rsquo;s a premium that we\u0026rsquo;re paying because of the\nskill shortage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:01\nWhat I want to do is I want to hire a specialist at Band Four from another\nindustry, a doctor, an engineer, a poet, a restaurant manager, an individual\nthat really has a lot of great knowledge. And I want to bring them to\ncybersecurity because they have that experience. The problem in the past,\nand I\u0026rsquo;ve done a couple of cases, they\u0026rsquo;ve been successful. My challenge was\nhow to infuse that person with cybersecurity knowledge once they\u0026rsquo;re ready\nand once they want to drink it. And I have to say, I know that not a tool, is\nnot suit for everything but the gen AI ability that we will have not yet to\ncreate customized learning paths, to create agents, bots training\nenvironments that allow an individual to learn a much faster pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:46\nI feel that can be a piece of the puzzle that allow us to bring a lot more\npeople into our industry in a much more effective way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 47:53\nYou do, but obviously I mapped out the education system with a whole\nbunch of professors of education. We thought the education system was all\nabout maximizing opportunity and critical thinking, and it\u0026rsquo;s not. It\u0026rsquo;s about\nproducing social cohesion and useful economic units.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:10\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to start at the more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 48:11\nInvolved bots and tools can have the dupe be used in a way that does what\nyou say, but it can also be used to create new balls of shame. So I would\nbe careful. You got to think about those. So we\u0026rsquo;ve got some questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:29\nOne of them is Jim, do you want to jump in? Because I think you can ask\nyour question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 48:33\nSo yeah, cheers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 48:34\nSo Simon, I came to your session at the Center Park years ago and asked\nyou about risk and you pointed me this book which you can\u0026rsquo;t see. It\u0026rsquo;s\ncalled The Search for Value and it relates ask you a question about risk\nand you pointed to that book which has got lots of equations in it. But I\nthink the most useful thing it does is it shows that risk is in some ways a\nreciprocal of business value, of stock value. It\u0026rsquo;s a direct relation. So I\nknow that you\u0026rsquo;re a risk guy and thanks so much for sharing the research. I\nsaw that risk analysis was an area of focus. I just want on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 49:14\nWell, so the risk analysis in terms of this group, it was what are the major\nareas? The ones that were right at the very top were very much about\npeople type stuff. So very much culture and cyber immunity and lower\ndown there was the concept of risk analysis. Now, from my point of view,\nwhen we start talking about risk analysis, I\u0026rsquo;m talking about value, I\u0026rsquo;m\ntalking about things like capital flow. I\u0026rsquo;m using maps because I\u0026rsquo;m actually\nusing the interconnections between the different components because\nevery line in a map is a bi directional exchange of value or I give money\nfor a cup of tea or whatever and risk itself is just another form of asset\nthat flows in these sorts of maps. But in order to assess that, I\u0026rsquo;ve got to\nactually understand the landscape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 50:00\nAnd so I\u0026rsquo;ve got a fundamental problem, is that I generally don\u0026rsquo;t\nunderstand the landscape. So without this sort of stuff, it\u0026rsquo;s the same with\nthe economic system, it\u0026rsquo;s mostly sticking fingers in the air and having a\ngood guess. It\u0026rsquo;s exactly the same with sustainability scope three. It\u0026rsquo;s all\nestimation because again, we don\u0026rsquo;t understand the components and the\nconnections between them. So I do like the risk management stuff, the risk\nanalysis. I\u0026rsquo;m going to say from my point of view, we\u0026rsquo;ve still got huge\nweaknesses in actually understanding the environments that we\u0026rsquo;re actually\noperating. And until we do start to understand those, we\u0026rsquo;re still going to\nbe in the world of guessing. Does that make sense?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 50:43\nYeah, it does. I suppose I was hoping that you\u0026rsquo;d talk about some technical\nframework or decision making framework or ways of gathering\ninformation. What do you think about the large language models? Do you\nthink they can help with risk analysis?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 50:57\nSo, as I said in the beginning, I think there\u0026rsquo;s a huge change between Chat\nGPT four and the multimodal form of Chat GPT because now we can\nactually start having a conversation with them. It\u0026rsquo;s huge, it\u0026rsquo;s night and\nday. It\u0026rsquo;s that sort of scale and so I think there are I\u0026rsquo;m already using them\nto help create maps and so forth off the space and starting to have\nconversations. I think we\u0026rsquo;re still very early days. I think there\u0026rsquo;s some real\npotential there once we get a handle on the landscapes because we\ncompete across multiple landscapes, territorial, technological, economic,\npolitical and cultural landscapes. Only one of them, the territorial, do we\nhave a handle on, do we have maps and radars and all the rest of it and\nthat sort of stuff? The other four, it\u0026rsquo;s often people talk about digital\nsovereignty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 51:51\nWell, where are your borders? Where are you going to compete? Or\nconflict with others, I should say, where are you going to cooperate?\nCollaborate. You can\u0026rsquo;t answer those questions without actually\nunderstanding the landscape. We can do that in territorial. So we\u0026rsquo;re\nlacking those basic things. So your question, can it help? I think we\u0026rsquo;re\ngetting there. We\u0026rsquo;re starting to be actually able to have conversations\noutside of the world of text. And so I think that\u0026rsquo;s a massive improvement.\nDoes that answer your question, Jim? Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 52:20\nThanks so much and thanks for sharing the research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 52:22\nReally interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 52:23\nPleasure. Pleasure. Absolute delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 52:25\nSo Jim, the way I connect that and I feel again, I think we have a golden\nopportunity now to really make sense is to connect risk with other parts,\nto have that situation awareness where in the past risk at top level was a\nbunch of spreadsheets. Then you have a gap, then you had reality, then\nyou might have maps. I think we now can start to be able to graph them\nout, connect them, create narratives and then use the maps to drive\nbehaviors, right, and to drive situation awareness. But it\u0026rsquo;s the connectivity\nthat is super important. Like for example, do people understand the risks\nof what the decisions they\u0026rsquo;re making? A project, doing a project, does he\nincrease, does he decrease? Does he maintain your risk? I think that was\nthe thing that was always missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 53:05\nWhen the exec make a decision, do they understand the ramifications of\nthe decisions they\u0026rsquo;re making? Right. And I think that in the past was\nimpossible. It was air gaps, right? It was spreadsheets or even system A\nand system B, like Simon daddy\u0026rsquo;s great picture of a company has 25 risk\nsystems, or 100 systems or 1000 systems. But I think we now have an\nopportunity to connect them. There\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of technologies and\nprocesses and thinking that are converging, but I feel the LLMs provide\nthe connection dot between them that allows us to do translations in a\nway that in the past was impossible or requires so much engineering cost\nthat nobody could do it. So watch this space. I think it\u0026rsquo;s really cool. So,\nfinal thoughts on last couple of minutes. You got another question from\nTristan. Yes, you\u0026rsquo;re right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 53:57\nIf you can unmute yourself, you should be able to. But I can ask is what\u0026rsquo;s\nthe threat intelligence equivalent of the hungarian VAT Records graph,\nthat graph that we can do on threat intelligence that gave us that visibility\nand find those 50 or 20 mission critical spots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 54:19\nI think you\u0026rsquo;re starting to see the requirement for the US government, the\nExecutive Order, the spombs, that\u0026rsquo;s fashioning positive mean within the\nMozilla Group, they\u0026rsquo;ve got a particular system which is all about funding\nopen source projects which is coming out and it has some incredible\ngraphing capability because of how it redistributes funds within that\nsystem. So there are ways of doing this sort of stuff. We\u0026rsquo;re not there yet\nthough, to be blunt. We\u0026rsquo;re not even talking maps here. We\u0026rsquo;re talking\ngraphs of the connections between things. To be blunt, the only places that\nI\u0026rsquo;ve actually seen where the market was able to create a deep\nunderstanding of the supply chains is the International Material Database\nSystem, which is in the automotive. And that\u0026rsquo;s because the European\nCommission came out with some pretty hefty legislation forcing to do so.\nAnd pretty much that\u0026rsquo;s about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 55:36\nI mean, Spom is government action. I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to require\ngovernment action. I think we\u0026rsquo;re not going to get it until actually we have\na government department of the supply chain or equivalent across\nmultiple. I hear a lot of talk, people say we\u0026rsquo;ll come together again, magic\ntechnology, it will be sorted on the blockchain. I\u0026rsquo;m sure they say just throw\na bit of AI on there and magic will happen. But people like to keep their\ninformation in silos, even though it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a great deal of sense,\neven though the value is amplified by sharing it, they don\u0026rsquo;t want to. So to\nsolve these problems, I think eventually you\u0026rsquo;re going to need government\nlegislation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 56:26\nI would add a couple of things. I think one thing is we\u0026rsquo;re currently severely\nlacking is collaboration. So as you guys probably are aware, not that long\nago, only US government signed an Executive Cybersecurity order for\ngoverning departments to collaborate on various cybersecurity issues,\nwhich is just recent. We have a breakdown between government, private\nindustry and then vendors. I\u0026rsquo;ve been sharing my ideas about various\nvendors and I think there are some vendors who are really changing the\nlandscape. I\u0026rsquo;ve been to a few calls where there\u0026rsquo;s nothing talked about\nsales pitches. It\u0026rsquo;s a collaboration culture where people are allowed to\ndiscuss various subjects under Chatham House rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 57:24\nSo I think vendors, private sector and government collaborating and\nsharing knowledge, in some ways it\u0026rsquo;s a way forward because it\u0026rsquo;s us\nagainst the bad guys and the more we can work together, the more we\u0026rsquo;re\ngoing to achieve. So how about some of the vendors? They\u0026rsquo;re potentially\nworking with hundreds or thousands of companies, so they have a lot of\nintelligence that could benefit the industry. So how we can collaborate and\nshare and knowledge and advance our collaboration, that\u0026rsquo;s the way\nforward, I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 58:00\nWell, the Open Security assignment on that final note, right, is trying to do\nis bid for collaboration right. I think we do a lot of collaboration here get\na lot of people together, share a lot of information. Everything is posted\non videos is out there. Right. But I agree we need a lot more and we need\nto get some of us physically together but yeah, absolutely. All right on top\nof the hour on this simon, thanks again. Always brilliant I love that you\ngave actually what you created was a really lovely which I need to\npackage and publish in the summit side on I always need people tell\nvolume maps take one thing for I just tell you, and I go read that. See\nthat? The first 15 minutes. Nice and easy again, Marius. Thanks for\ncollaborations, and I see you guys next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus - 58:43\nThank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon Wardley - 58:44\nAbsolute pleasure.

You know, has to\nbe one of my favorite topics, especially, I have to say, the thing I\u0026rsquo;ve learned\nthe most in the last 510 years that changed my perception. I have to add\nGen AI to that now. I have to say, Simon, but, you know, I still feel that it\u0026rsquo;s\none of those unexplored areas that has so much that we need to do to\nfigure out how to really use it. And it\u0026rsquo;s not perfect, but it\u0026rsquo;s way better than\na lot of the things that we use. So big fan on worldly maps. So, Simon, I\nknow you got some things you want to present to us.

And by\nthe way, I love that. Isolate your app. Spot on. And we might get some\nlanguage models too, here. So looking forward to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 00:30\nGreat. Well, thanks a lot, Denis. Yeah. Again. My name is Clint. Clint\nObloblock. I work for a company that sponsors an open source project\ncalled Openzd. And as everybody knows, every good open source project\nmust have a mascot. And so down in the lower right hand corner here,\nyou\u0026rsquo;ll see Ziggy. And Ziggy is our mascot. He is a piece of ZD for zero\ntrust. All right. So anyway, let\u0026rsquo;s get into it. Usually in the last few years,\nwhenever I tell people that I work for an open source project, that is a\nZero Trust overlay Network, this is usually the response I\u0026rsquo;ll get, right? A\nbig deep eye roll. Because in the last few years, particularly, the term zero\ntrust has kind of been turned into a marketing buzword. So hopefully\nyou\u0026rsquo;ve seen this presentation. You said, is it real?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 01:26\nIs it legit, or is it not? And by the end of this presentation, I\u0026rsquo;m going to\nturn you from a deep eye roll into Shaq here and that kitty cat with a little\nshimmy shake shake, right? Like, give me that. Zero trust. That\u0026rsquo;s my goal.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re watching this live, or if you\u0026rsquo;re watching it on a recording and you\nhave Go, I invite you to participate in the demo. That\u0026rsquo;s going to happen\ntowards the end of the presentation here. So if you\u0026rsquo;re watching it on\nrecording, pause the video, go install Go, and you\u0026rsquo;ll get to enjoy the\nappetizer for our Zero Trust overlay Network. Here\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re going to\ntalk about, and you\u0026rsquo;ll forgive me if you have seen this sort of stuff before.\nMaybe you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with Openzd already. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;ve seen me give a\nsimilar presentation to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 02:14\nBut this is the current overview. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to assume anybody knows\nwhat Zero Trust is. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to start at the basics, and we\u0026rsquo;re going\nto go from there. So let\u0026rsquo;s first start by talking about what the current\nnetwork security setup usually looks like, right? And here\u0026rsquo;s what it will\nusually look like. It\u0026rsquo;ll be a castle and a moat motif. So this is what you\nhear a lot of that castle and the moat kind of idea. And so that\u0026rsquo;s what\nmost people think of when they think of current network security. So here\nwe have just a regular basic network, right? And what is a regular basic\nnetwork? Well, it\u0026rsquo;s just a bunch of castles and it\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of moats. And\nwe have individual little networks and individual little locations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 02:54\nAnd our job is to allow network to allow devices to send traffic to one\nanother, right? So once you get behind the walls, once you get over the\nmoat, all these devices can send traffic to wherever they want. And that\u0026rsquo;s\nwhat normal network security is all about. Once you\u0026rsquo;re on the network,\nyou\u0026rsquo;re considered trusted. Obviously that\u0026rsquo;s not a great idea. And this was\nsuch a bad idea way back in the day that we said, hey, http FTP, that\u0026rsquo;s\nmaybe not the greatest idea. Let\u0026rsquo;s make our network a little bit more\nsecure and let\u0026rsquo;s put TLS or transport layer security everywhere. And so\nthat\u0026rsquo;s what we did. We went out and we got a little lock icon and we put it\non our little individual devices, and now everybody has TLS. So instead of\nFTP, now we\u0026rsquo;re using SSH and SCP. Instead of Http.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 03:45\nWe\u0026rsquo;re using Https. Then people said, well, you know, that\u0026rsquo;s great, Https,\nbut it\u0026rsquo;s kind of hard to get that certificate. So poof out. Popped this thing\ncalled https everywhere. HTPs Everywhere is a project by the Electronic\nFrontier Foundation, and it was so successful that they\u0026rsquo;re actually phasing\nit out. But what it would do is it would take your Http URL that you typed\nin Google.com and upgrade you automatically to Https. So it would check\nto see if your browser had access to an actual secure URL. If it did, it\nwould automatically upgrade you. And that was great. Less encrypt was\nstarted because everybody was like, hey, this Https is everywhere now,\nright? How do I get some Https for me? Turns out back in the Dark Ages\nbefore let\u0026rsquo;s encrypt and SSL. Zero, I think is what it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 04:39\nThere\u0026rsquo;s another one that\u0026rsquo;s similar to let\u0026rsquo;s encrypt now. You would have to\npay for a certificate. So most people on their trusted network were like,\nit\u0026rsquo;s trusted, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to bother with this HTPs stuff. Of course, that\u0026rsquo;s\nobviously a bad idea. We should not trust our local network. And that\u0026rsquo;s a\ncentral tenet of the term zero trust, right? Trusting that network, you\u0026rsquo;re\nsafe, you\u0026rsquo;re secure if you\u0026rsquo;re on that local network. So why is it a bad\nthing? Well, obviously if an attacker in this case, represented by our little\nfella down here in the lower left in red, because he\u0026rsquo;s dangerous, if they\nattach to your network even though you have TLS, well, what are they\ngoing to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 05:18\nThey\u0026rsquo;re going to start sending packets, they\u0026rsquo;re going to start probing your\nnetwork, and then if they find an O day or a zero day, or some sort of\nvulnerability, they\u0026rsquo;re going to compromise your laptop and poof. Now\nyou\u0026rsquo;re having a bad time. So horizontally moving across a network\nsomething that we really need to control. And if you didn\u0026rsquo;t know it, this is\nwhat VPNs are, right? When you attach to a VPN, you\u0026rsquo;re basically turning\nthose three little castles into one giant castle that lets you get to anything,\nanywhere. Most of the time, now you might have an advanced VPN that\ndoes a little bit of segmentation, then fantastic, good for you, but lots of\npeople don\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 05:54\nAnd so if you are attaching to a VPN, oftentimes you\u0026rsquo;re able to get to all\nof those corporate resources without any worry other than having to be on\nthe VPN. So again, I mentioned the word segmentation. We started to do\nthis idea of segmenting things where maybe now we\u0026rsquo;ll take our little Ziggy\nand we\u0026rsquo;ll put him in a little policeman\u0026rsquo;s outfit and he\u0026rsquo;s going to police our\ntraffic. So now when that nasty offender gets on our network and wants\nto send those packets, we have old Ziggy there taking care of business,\nstopping those. Cool, cool. Right. Everything\u0026rsquo;s good? Are we done? Call it\na day? Of course not. We can\u0026rsquo;t call it a day. It\u0026rsquo;s never going to be good\nenough. So what happens?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 06:32\nThese attackers, they are ever vigilant, they are always out there and once\nthey have a foothold, they\u0026rsquo;re not going to give up. So they\u0026rsquo;re going to keep\ntrying. They\u0026rsquo;re going to compromise a laptop that does have access to the\ntarget that they\u0026rsquo;re looking for and then use that target as a stepping stone\nto the next network where they\u0026rsquo;re going to just compromise that target of\nopportunity. All right, so how do we combat some of this? Enter the idea\nof zero trust. Again, we\u0026rsquo;re back at our basic network and I\u0026rsquo;m going to get\nrid of the castles and the moats now and we\u0026rsquo;re going to just look at this\ndiagram. But what if our network had this idea of a device identity? So\nthis is one of the core pillars of Zero Trust, this device identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 07:15\nAnd what it means is every device on your network has a strong identity\nthat the network can use to verify the authenticity of the identity\nconnecting to that network. So if the identity is permitted to connect to\nthe network, then great, it\u0026rsquo;ll connect to the network and it can send\ntraffic. And if it\u0026rsquo;s not, then it won\u0026rsquo;t be able to. And that\u0026rsquo;s called device\nidentity. This is how Openzd bootstraps device identity. It\u0026rsquo;s a little\ncomplicated. If there\u0026rsquo;s any questions, hit us up on discourse, since you\u0026rsquo;ll be\nwatching this in a replay, but hit us up in discourse and ask about how\nOpenzd actually accomplishes secure enrollment. And this is just one\nflavor of getting your authentication to the overlay network and we\u0026rsquo;ll see\nmore about what enrolling means in a bit. And then there\u0026rsquo;s device identity\nwith our attacker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 08:05\nSo if that firewall sorry, if that network has all these little firewalls, that\nunderstand device identity. Even if the attacker is to get on your network\nand be able to start trying to send packets, well, the network is smart\nenough to not permit that attacker to send these malicious packets, right?\nThe network knows the device identity and doesn\u0026rsquo;t even let you on\noftentimes. That\u0026rsquo;s called an overlay network. So what are they going to\ndo? Well, they\u0026rsquo;re going to just go out and they\u0026rsquo;re going to find themselves\nan identity in a laptop that does have access. Because once they have a\nlaptop that has access, well, guess what? Game\u0026rsquo;s over. They\u0026rsquo;re able to\nconnect to that machine again and Zero trust been defeated, right? Call it\na day. Of course not. There\u0026rsquo;s even more we can do. So what do we do\nnext?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 08:51\nNext we take that idea of segmentation and we lower it even more. We\nkeep narrowing the segment. So instead of having a great big VPN,\ninstead of having a little network, instead of having one device, we keep\ngoing further and further down to its logical end, which will be\napplications. And we\u0026rsquo;ll see that in a bit too. So this concept of least\nprivilege says every identity on the overlay network is authorized to\nconnect to other identities or other services on that overlay network. If it\u0026rsquo;s\nnot authorized, you can\u0026rsquo;t connect. So here we have that same attacker.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re trying to send data over to our target of opportunity, but ha, they\ncan\u0026rsquo;t. Because of least privilege, the network knows what services this\ndevice can attach to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 09:36\nAnd that laptop in the lower right that it\u0026rsquo;s been trying to compromise all\nalong is not able to connect to that laptop. So of course we\u0026rsquo;re done, right?\nCall it good. But as is always, if that identity is compromised and that\nidentity has access to the target of opportunity and to the service in\nquestion, then you\u0026rsquo;re still going to be able to be attacked. But does that\nmean this is not a good approach? Of course not. We have made this\nalready. Just imagine how many hoops, how many extra hoops this\nattacker has had to jump through just to find a machine that can even\nconnect to the target of opportunity. It\u0026rsquo;s all about layers and layers of\nsecurity. And the more layers you add, obviously the better it is. The\nsmaller your attack surface, the better it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 10:22\nSo least privilege giving the identities only the ability to contact the things\nthat they\u0026rsquo;re supposed to contact, narrowing that focus. Another core pillar\nof zero trust is continuous authorization or posture checking. So this\nwould be things like am I connecting to the service from Windows? I can\nonly get here from Windows or from Mac or from Linux or is my patch\nlevel of the operating system up to date? Things along those lines. So if a\nnew patch comes out, you can update a posture check and then suddenly\nthat laptop is no longer able to even attach to the network, no longer able\nto send traffic. All right, and that\u0026rsquo;s a little bit about zero trust. So now\nwe\u0026rsquo;re going to get into application embedded zero trust. You heard\nmention the term overlay network prior. So what exactly is an overlay\nnetwork?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 11:17\nYou might have already kind of figured it out, but here we\u0026rsquo;re going to take\nthe Internet, right? Generally speaking, it\u0026rsquo;s really convenient if the\nInternet can just be your overlay network. So can we turn our Internet, the\nInternet, into our overlay network with Opencd? Yeah, you can. So what\ndoes that look like? We\u0026rsquo;ll deploy a controller somewhere out in the\nInternet, and this controller\u0026rsquo;s job in life is to manage authorization and\nauthentication. So when a device comes online, it talks to the controller.\nThe controller says, yes, you are who you say you are, and you are now\nauthorized to connect to the network. Sorry, authenticated to connect to\nthe network. And you can actually connect. Authorization is the green\nlight, if you will, giving the identity the ability to actually connect to the\nservicing question. So we have a controller now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 12:11\nWe have these things we call routers, and there are different kinds of\nrouters, some of which can service links between other routers and some\nservice edge connections. These things come online and they form\nconnections to everything else. So Openzd is an overlay network that\u0026rsquo;s\nalso a mesh network, which does differentiate it from other overlay\ntechnologies, like normal VPNs, where you have one concentrator and one\ninput, one output kind of place. With Opencd overlay, you can have\nmultiple inputs and multiple outputs, and those things all go together and\nthey form secure Mutual TLS connections. And that\u0026rsquo;s important. And this\ndiagram gets really busy when I add all these locks on here. But that\u0026rsquo;s\nimportant because every single edge router to edge router connection or\nrouter to controller, that\u0026rsquo;s all Mutual TLS, meaning the device attaching,\nmust provide a certificate to the server it\u0026rsquo;s attaching to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 13:04\nAnd the authenticity of the certificate that is being presented is verified by\nboth the client and the server that uses public key infrastructure. If you\nhaven\u0026rsquo;t looked that up, fun topic, deep topic, but that\u0026rsquo;s what Mutual TLS\nis all about. I\u0026rsquo;m going to take those lock icons away because it makes it\nbusy. And then the edge routers also are there, as I said before, to service\nconnections between edge devices or edge SDKs, and the edge router. And\nthat\u0026rsquo;s all done for the express purpose of one thing, and that\u0026rsquo;s sending\ndata back and forth. Obviously, the whole idea of a network is to send and\nshare data. Ideally, it\u0026rsquo;s with identities which are only authenticated and\nonly authorized to send that data, like on an opencd overlay network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 13:52\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the three basic forms of zero trust as we define zero trust, and we\u0026rsquo;ll\ngo into each one here in a moment. Zero trust, network access. This is\nwhat most vendors will tell you is zero trust. You trust your local network.\nWink. Not a good idea, right? You trust your local network, you trust your\nremote network, and then everything in between, we will make zero trust.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s pretty darn good. It\u0026rsquo;s actually not bad, right? It\u0026rsquo;s pretty good.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not terrible, but we can do better. So what if we take an agent and\nput the agent on their computer. Like for example, on my Windows\ncomputer, I\u0026rsquo;m running the Windows desktop edge for Windows, which\nlooks like this. And so I have a little agent on my computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 14:38\nAnd that little agent\u0026rsquo;s job in life is to make sure that traffic is only trusted\non the device. And that\u0026rsquo;s pretty darn good. Openzd works like this. Other\ncool technologies like WireGuard works like this as well. Or your VPN,\neven if you want to consider the VPN right, there\u0026rsquo;s a little agent that runs\nand its job is to intercept all of this traffic and then shuttle it safely over to\nthe other side. If it\u0026rsquo;s a server, if it\u0026rsquo;s a client, wherever it\u0026rsquo;s going to. But\neverything in between is safe. So even if you\u0026rsquo;re using Http and Insecure\nprotocol in your device, you can successfully and safely tunnel Http to the\nserver. And we\u0026rsquo;ll see that happen here in a minute. And then finally,\nobviously, the end all be all application access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 15:22\nKeep reducing the attack surface all the way down as far as you can into\nthe application itself. No longer do I trust my host\u0026rsquo;s OS stack. Let\u0026rsquo;s go\nback a moment. If we look at the network access, not application. Come\non, where\u0026rsquo;s my build? Right there. That\u0026rsquo;s host access. If we look at this,\nanything on my local machine that sends Http is able to go into this\ntunnel. So if I curl there, or if I have malware, or if I have the actual app\nthat I\u0026rsquo;m trying to use, all of which can go into this tunnel and safely\ntunnel, that is what application embedded zero trust can solve. You no\nlonger have a listening port here, intercepting traffic. You don\u0026rsquo;t have\nanything that does that sort of interception. The application simply writes\ninto the zero trust stream by itself. That\u0026rsquo;s a huge benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 16:14\nAnd you can even go one step further. With Openzd, you can use a\nhardware route of trust, which is really cool because then you don\u0026rsquo;t even\nhave to trust that the file is safe on your operating system. Always there\u0026rsquo;s\nsome root of trust somewhere here. It would be a little green dongle that\nyou plug into your computer. All right, so all that\u0026rsquo;s what our application\nembedded zero trust is all about. Let\u0026rsquo;s focus now and we\u0026rsquo;ll just take a look\nat the attacker and the client that it\u0026rsquo;s trying to attach to. So what are we\ngoing to do? We\u0026rsquo;re going to take an SDK, we\u0026rsquo;re going to stuff it into our\napplication, and then magically lock icon shows up and we have a secure\napplication. And that\u0026rsquo;s basically what end to end embedded zero trust is\nall about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 16:56\nApplication embedded zero trust cool is no firewalls are needed. We have\napplication embedded zero trust already. We\u0026rsquo;re good to go. What does that\nlook like when the attacker gets there? Well, that attacker compromises\nthe laptop. You have an application embedded zero trust SCP program,\nSQL program, and FTP program, right? Secure protocol. SQL. You never\nknow if it\u0026rsquo;s secure or not. Depends on how you\u0026rsquo;ve done it. FTP? Definitely\nnot. So if the SCP application wants to send traffic to SCP, it\u0026rsquo;s permitted\nto. If the SQL Server wants to, it\u0026rsquo;s permitted to. If the FTP wants to, it\u0026rsquo;s\npermitted to. Obviously. So now what happens if the SCP application tries\nto send traffic to that FTP application? The SCP application has no idea\nhow to send traffic to FTP. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t even know how to get there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 17:45\nAs they say, you can\u0026rsquo;t get there from here, so it\u0026rsquo;s denied. Same would be\ntrue for SQL traffic going to FTP or for the SQL Server program to try to\nsend SCP. It literally cannot be done because it must go over the overlay,\nand the overlay won\u0026rsquo;t even permit it to. So why that\u0026rsquo;s? Super powerful.\nNow you have effective immunity to malware, showing up on your local\ncomputer, compromising, one of those bad applications, super cool stuff.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s where Openzd comes into the picture. Now, you might be\nsaying to yourself, this sounds like a lot of work and it is a lot of work,\nand it was a lot of work. And this slide is one of my favorites. It represents\nthe duration or the longest path a human can walk across the earth, right?\nAnd this is basically the path to Zero Trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 18:37\nWe realize everybody\u0026rsquo;s not going to go straight from Brownfield\napplication to application embedded Zero Trust Greenfield application. If\nyou can, then great. You get to start in Siberia or maybe in Africa,\ndepending on where your start and end is. But otherwise you\u0026rsquo;re going to\nhave to go the whole entire path. And so we realize that it is a journey.\nOpen Zero Trust is a journey, and people aren\u0026rsquo;t going to jump right into\nZero Trust and application embedded Zero Trust immediately. So maybe\nyou\u0026rsquo;ll start somewhere in the middle of Asia, maybe you\u0026rsquo;ll start somewhere\nin the middle of Africa, and your journey might be different. But this is the\nlongest path a human can walk and it represents the fact that it is quite\nthe journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 19:20\nBut Openzd has you covered because we have those things I remember I\nreferred to before as those tunneler apps. So if you have Linux or if you\nhave iOS or Android or Windows like me, or whatever, your particular\noperating system target is of choice, you can use one of those tunnelers to\nbridge the gap between application. Embedded Zero Trust and brownfield\ndeployments tunnelers do have a really cool property that is worth noting\nbecause if you have an Open ZD overlay network, you will have these\ntunnelers available to you. And so suddenly you can start doing cool things\nwith all your brownfield apps too. So for example, one of the superpowers\nfrom Openzd that tunnelers provide is true private DNS. You can create\nfictitious DNS names that your users can then connect to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 20:12\nLike my ZD which is not a valid top level domain or Linux Foundation one\nsummit. Like I made this slide for Bodibic boat face, right? Fluffernutter.\nThese are all DNS entries that you can create and would be private to\nyour bespoke overlay network. So that\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool. But not only is it\nprivate DNS super cool, but it\u0026rsquo;s authenticated DNS. It\u0026rsquo;s truly private.\nRight? If you deny the user and the identity, I should say access to your\noverlay network poof that DNS entry goes away. And so those are some\nreally powerful superpowers of a tunneler, and we could get into tunnelers\nsomeday. That sounds interesting, but what are we here for? We\u0026rsquo;re here to\ntalk about the superpowers of application embedded zero trust. So let\u0026rsquo;s\nblow it up and let\u0026rsquo;s get going. So what do we have here? We have two\npictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 21:06\nPerhaps you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with the picture on the top. That is called the\nBeast. The Beast is a limousine that the United States presidents drive\naround in. It is bulletproof. It is blast proof. Right? It\u0026rsquo;s got all this security\nbuilt into it, not bolted on top like the Mad Max approach. Right? With the\nMad Max approach, you\u0026rsquo;re like, oh, there\u0026rsquo;s a chink in the armor right\nthere. Oh, I can shoot through here. Oh, it has regular tires, right? The\nBeast. Sleek, sexy. Security built inside. Secure from day one, secure by\ndesign. Mad Max. We\u0026rsquo;ll do our best we can. Day two, security. It happens,\nright? We\u0026rsquo;ll just keep bolting stuff on until we make it secure because we\u0026rsquo;ll\nget there, I\u0026rsquo;m sure, right? So that\u0026rsquo;s a key difference of application\nembedded zero trust is it\u0026rsquo;s built secure by default.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 21:59\nYou have zero trust security built into it right out of the gate. That\u0026rsquo;s a\nsuperpower. Another one. From a developer\u0026rsquo;s point of view, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if\nyou\u0026rsquo;ve ever had a service that\u0026rsquo;s behind a load balancer, but all too often\nwhen you\u0026rsquo;re behind a load balancer, you as a developer, you don\u0026rsquo;t even\nknow where this thing is going. So you\u0026rsquo;re told to connect to my\napplication server, and then that gets turned into an IP address. And then\nif you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, the load balancer will forward source IP. And so you as a\ndeveloper could have a shot at understanding who is connecting to your\nservice before they actually connect to your service. But that\u0026rsquo;s not the case\nwith an overlay network. Like Openzd. With Openzd, you know, Clint is\ntrying to connect to Prometheus. There\u0026rsquo;s no question about it. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 22:46\nYou know the exact identity connecting, you know the exact identity that\u0026rsquo;s\nbeing connected to that is also a superpower. On top of that superpower is\nit\u0026rsquo;s not just for the clients. It\u0026rsquo;s also for the server side. Right. Usually we\nthink about zero trust. We think about security. You think about the cloud.\nThe cloud is safe, right? Nobody\u0026rsquo;s going to get into my cloud. My VPC is\nsecure. I\u0026rsquo;ve only got 85 holes open to my VPC. That\u0026rsquo;s only 85 holes. Not a\nworry. Well, with a zero trust overlay like Openzed, you can have zero\nopen holes to your firewall. So your VPC can be truly firewalled off from\nthe world. No open listening ports at all on top of that, so that\u0026rsquo;s the\nfirewall. On top of that, the server has no listening ports either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 23:33\nWe already talked a little bit before about side channel attacks being\nimpervious to side channel attacks and the local computer, that goes for\nthe server too. So if that FTP server is listening out in VPC land, or virtual\nnetwork land, or Cloud land, wherever Kubernetes land, it\u0026rsquo;ll have no\nlistening ports, it is not attackable by IP and port, literally not attackable.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re going to see in our demo in a bit. Oh yeah, I guess\nthis is just more no inbound Firewall polls. Same exact point. I should\nhave looked ahead of my slides, but you get the point, right? No listening\nports, no inbound firewall rules. That is just super cool stuff. I don\u0026rsquo;t know\nif you are familiar, but a couple of years ago there was a CVE, a critical\nvulnerability and exploit around Java and Spring called Spring Boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 24:26\nAnd it was kind of a big deal, right? If you got a hole in that firewall, then\nanybody on the open Internet can do what? Oh, they can just attach right\nthrough that hole in the firewall, hit that Spring Boot server, and\ncompromise whatever they want to compromise, because that\nvulnerability was of astronomical proportions. That\u0026rsquo;s a good zero day.\nGuess what you can\u0026rsquo;t do when you have a zero trust network like Open\nZD. You can\u0026rsquo;t even connect to that, what\u0026rsquo;s the word? Attackable target. I\ncan\u0026rsquo;t come up with the right word, so you can\u0026rsquo;t even connect to it. So the\nonly people who could connect to it are people who have that strong\nidentity. Now of course, if one of them gets compromised, then your bets\nare off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 25:08\nBut you have reduced your attack vector from something that\u0026rsquo;s on the\nOpen Internet to, if you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, whitelisting of IP addresses. But you\ndon\u0026rsquo;t even have to worry about that because Openzd you can just bypass\nall that and secure your application directly, have no listening ports, that\nattacker has no chance to get to that Spring Boot application. And so that\nwas also another issue that the Spring framework had, and I don\u0026rsquo;t\nremember exactly what CVE oh, what\u0026rsquo;s this CVE? Also a 9.8. So a 9.8. If\nyou haven\u0026rsquo;t seen the CVSS scoring, I do recommend you go check it out.\nThe critical Vulnerability scoring system, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty neat. It has like six to\neight parameters, I don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly, but the two that I focus one of\nwhich is attack vector is Network. Permissions required none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 25:58\nIf you have an attack vector of network with a permissions required of\nnone, you\u0026rsquo;re already in a bad place, right? That means anybody on the\nnetwork is able to potentially attack that vulnerable target. So if it\u0026rsquo;s on\nthe Open Internet, I don\u0026rsquo;t even know how many billion devices there are\nout on the Open Internet nowadays that are available to attack that\ntarget. With Openzd, you can close all that down. And again, before I told\nyou, another superpower is contacting the client from the server. Usually,\nif you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, you know what a server side event is, or you know what a\nWebSocket is, and you can open a WebSocket to your server and you can\nget events that way, or you have some sort of IoT type of implementation\nthat allows you to do this sort of stuff too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 26:44\nOpenzd\u0026rsquo;s overlay network already allows you to do that. So if you were to\nembed Zero Trust into your server, into your client, it\u0026rsquo;s just another client\non the network, your server is just another client and your client is just\nanother client. And it\u0026rsquo;s possible for your client to declare that it binds or\naccepts connections from other clients on the network. So let\u0026rsquo;s think of\nlike SSH would be one of those ones where you would define an identity as\nable to SSH or RDP for example. But with Zero Trust enabled by Openzd,\nyou can use application embedded Zero Trust and talk from your server\nstraight to your client. So if you want to notify them all, not a problem.\nYou can just do that. You can just connect to them. But you must be\nauthorized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 27:29\nThe server must be authorized to send a message or dial, and the client\nmust be authorized to accept a message. And then soon Openzd is going to\nallow the clients to turn off that ability of listening, even so that the device\nyou with your tunneler could turn off the ability to listen. So you are in the\ncontrol there too. That\u0026rsquo;s super cool. And we use that with Amazon\nLambda. So because it\u0026rsquo;s application embedded, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter where\nyou deploy it, right? This is not Kubernetes only, this is not VPCs and\nAmazon only. It is literally anywhere it\u0026rsquo;s application embedded. You can\nrun this on your local laptop, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to run my client on my local\nlaptop here in a minute and when I stop blathering and get to the actual\ndemo, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 28:15\nSo another killer feature, Openzd, gives you end to end encryption out of\nthe gate. So by adopting Zero Trust into your application and your server,\nyou have true end to end encryption. If you remember, before I talked\nabout Mutual TLS, I talked about the router and the client connecting and\nforming a Mutual TLS connection. And that\u0026rsquo;s great between links, but that\nmeans when you\u0026rsquo;re on the router or at the endpoint, you can see whatever\nthe traffic is. With end to end encryption, even if you were sending traffic\nthrough that router has no ability to be able to read that traffic. On top of\nthat, even if you had. If you use a secure protocol like SSH on your other\nside, on both sides, the SSH application protocol is also another layer of\nencryption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 29:08\nBeing able to obtain secrets and defeat the security of that connection is\ngoing to be incredibly difficult. Attackers are going to have such a hard\ntime. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not going to be worth it. Because of course, if it\u0026rsquo;s\nworth it, maybe people will find a way to get through it. But it\u0026rsquo;ll take\nnation state actors in order to go through the amount of effort it\u0026rsquo;ll take to\nbypass those three layers of encryption. So don\u0026rsquo;t forget application layer\nend to end encryption. Mutual TLS makes it basically unhackable, and I\u0026rsquo;ll\nsay basically because everybody who is sufficiently motivated, perhaps\nthey\u0026rsquo;ll find a way. But as we know, of course, there\u0026rsquo;s not right now. And\nthat uses Libsodium, which is built for small devices. So you\u0026rsquo;ll see, Openzd\noftentimes is targeting IoT type devices because we have a Csdk and the\nCsdk is tiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 29:58\nAnd Chacha 20 poly 13 Five was built for tiny devices. So even if you have\na Raspberry pi or something teeny tiny, zero trust is not out of reach. Take\nan SDK, stuff it in your application. Now you have zero trust available to\nyou. Another just amazing superpower, in my opinion, port inference. If\nyou go out to any network and you scan that network, you\u0026rsquo;re going to find\nout, oh, Clint\u0026rsquo;s using MySQL clinch using VNC, right? It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter.\nWhen you send all of your traffic through the secure zero trust overlay\nevery port becomes 443. So good luck figuring out what services\nsomebody is using just by scanning ports. You\u0026rsquo;re never going to do it. It\u0026rsquo;ll\njust be all 443 or whatever you choose. 443 is just a common one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 30:50\nSo all your traffic pardon me 1 second, all your traffic gets synthesized\nover a single connection through the Openzd overlay, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t\nimpact performance. So don\u0026rsquo;t think of it like that. It\u0026rsquo;s a big pipe. It\u0026rsquo;s as\nbig as your network speed is. So all of your protocols travel over that pipe.\nAnd so they all look like port 443, whether it\u0026rsquo;s FTP, SQL or SSH or\nwhatever I mentioned before. Continuous authorization. You get that for\nfree with Openzd as well. Domain checking, Mac address checking,\nprocess checking. Also, ZD supports two factor authentication out of the\nbox. So that\u0026rsquo;s all cool stuff you get. You get a self healing mesh network,\nwhich is also really important. So this way, if your device is sending traffic\nand one of those routers goes down, no problem. Openzd will just route\nthe traffic from one place to the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 31:39\nThat\u0026rsquo;s super cool. And then this is what it looks like. This is an example of\ntaking an actual Java application which creates a client and then sends\ntraffic over that client from the before to the after. Key things to pay\nattention here, let me make it a little bit easier for you to see it. Let me\nmake it even easier for you to see it, right? So you have no need to know\nthe IP address anymore. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to know its local host or whatever\nthe IP is. You don\u0026rsquo;t have any need as the developer to know what port it is.\nYou just know you have some super secure service, and your identity is\nauthorized to, in this case, bind to bind that identity. So this is acting as a\nserver. Bind means I accept traffic. Dial means I\u0026rsquo;ll send traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 32:29\nAnd so as a developer, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to know where things are defined or\nwhere they\u0026rsquo;re hosted, et cetera. One of my favorites, maybe my favorite\nembedded superpower is this thing I refer to as Implicit multifactor\nauthentication. So if you have a strong identity, you can\u0026rsquo;t even get onto\nthe network. You can\u0026rsquo;t even send traffic to your API. Now, presumably\nyour API will have some sort of authorization that\u0026rsquo;s baked into it. So this\nSDK on the left will talk to this API on the right, and the API will verify the\ntraffic in some way. The network also verifies that identity by having that\nimplicit identity baked into it. So, realistically, you have two factors of\nauthentication already. By just using a zero trust overlay network, you\nhave your strong identity from openzd, and you have your authentication\nfrom your API service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 33:25\nAnd so those are the selling points about application embedded zero trust.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ve blathered long enough. Maybe you just skipped right ahead to the\ndemo. Maybe they put nice little chapter marks in here for you, and you\njust skipped into the good stuff. So that\u0026rsquo;s cool. So here\u0026rsquo;s where we\nactually see all of this in action. We\u0026rsquo;re going to put our money where our\nmouth is. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at what our demo is going to look like. So I\u0026rsquo;ve\nalready deployed. In fact, I won\u0026rsquo;t say I did, because I didn\u0026rsquo;t deploy this\nnetwork. The Net Foundry console deployed this network on my behalf.\nWe call it the Appetizer Network to get you to want some openzd. And\nwhat we have is we have a network deployed, we have a controller, we\nhave some routers in the mix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 34:03\nAnd on the left, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the Reflect client. That\u0026rsquo;s my client running on\nmy local computer. And then on the right, you\u0026rsquo;ll see Reflect server, HTP\nserver. And that\u0026rsquo;s deployed in Amazon, Fargate. So I made an application,\nI bundled it into a docker container, and then my good friend Mike\nGuthrie deployed it out onto Fargate. And now we have the appetizer out\nthere running. This is all open source. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I even mentioned this.\nAll of this is free and open source, right? You can go get all of this for free.\nHost your own openzd network today. Go get it. And if you want to look at\nthe demo, you\u0026rsquo;ll go to the Openzd test kitchen. ZD zero trust. ZT. ZD.\nItalian pasta. So our little logo here, this little piece of ZD. So here\u0026rsquo;s\nZiggy back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 34:52\nHe\u0026rsquo;s got a chef hat on this time and he\u0026rsquo;s in our Openzd test kitchen where\nwe basically test things out before we put them into the main repository,\nwhich is just Openzd GitHub.com slash Openzd. All right, out there is an\nappetizer repository and aptly named. We have an appetizer Openzd IO\npause right now because you can go there right now. And presumably we\nhaven\u0026rsquo;t taken it down whenever you watch this video, who knows? But if\nyou\u0026rsquo;re doing it right now, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably have this available to you and\nyou can see I\u0026rsquo;ve gone there appetizer Openc IO. If you enter your email\naddress, which is what I\u0026rsquo;d ask you to do because that\u0026rsquo;s a good, nice,\nunique name, then fantastic. We\u0026rsquo;ll get your email.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 35:34\nHopefully we won\u0026rsquo;t solicit you, but maybe we but you can add yourself to\nmy Openzd overlay network and if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be bothered with it,\nyou can just click the don\u0026rsquo;t bother with me, don\u0026rsquo;t bother me right now. But\nif you want to let us know that you care about Openzd, you can go ahead\nand put an email in there. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve done that and click the button,\nyou\u0026rsquo;re going to see, it brings you to a page that looks like this. And then\nyou\u0026rsquo;ll see run some of the sample programs. You\u0026rsquo;ll see the git clone, you\u0026rsquo;ll\nsee where the repository is and then it\u0026rsquo;ll give you the little kind of overview\nthat I just showed you and tell you some samples to run. Fantastic. That\u0026rsquo;s\nwhat we\u0026rsquo;re going to see because I\u0026rsquo;m actually going to just go and do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 36:11\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s just go and do it, shall we? First thing I need to do is I need to\nbring up Microsoft Edge, a browser which I literally never use and with a\nbunch of junk on it. So let\u0026rsquo;s go to Appetizer Openzd IO and you\u0026rsquo;ll see I get\nthe same thing that I showed you before. I\u0026rsquo;m going to enter my I\u0026rsquo;m not\ngonna put my email address, but it\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"mailto:Clint@openzed.org\"\u003eClint@openzed.org\u003c/a\u003e. If you want to\nemail me, you can. But I\u0026rsquo;m not going to type it in here because who knows\nwho\u0026rsquo;s going to look at it. So we\u0026rsquo;ll just use Clint and let\u0026rsquo;s do Open SEC\nSummit. Let\u0026rsquo;s do that. That sounds great. That\u0026rsquo;s probably pretty unique.\nAnd add me to openzd. All right, so now once I\u0026rsquo;ve added myself to no, I\ncan\u0026rsquo;t click on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 36:58\nApparently once I\u0026rsquo;ve added myself to Openzd, then I can go and I can\nclone the repository. Now I\u0026rsquo;ve already cloned the repository, but you can\njust go ahead and copy that if you want to. And then I need to download\nmy token. So remember I talked about enrolling an identity. The identity\nenrollment starts with a signed document, which in this case is a JWT, and\nso it says, where would I like to save it? I\u0026rsquo;m going to save this thing into\nmy appetizer. GitHub openzdest kitchen. Where is it? It\u0026rsquo;s in here\nsomewhere. Work GitHub openzd. Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s go back up and find it.\nWhere is my test kitchen? That oh, it\u0026rsquo;s because it\u0026rsquo;s on Linux. That\u0026rsquo;s right. I\nam running this inside of Linux, which is why I don\u0026rsquo;t remember where it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 37:58\nAnd let\u0026rsquo;s see, my username is going to be in home and CD and Git, where\nis Git? In here, and here\u0026rsquo;s GitHub. And here\u0026rsquo;s opencd test kitchen. And\nhere\u0026rsquo;s the appetizer. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to save this there. Now when I saved it\nthere, I can then just go run the application and I\u0026rsquo;ve already CD into that\nlocation. So if I bring up my terminal and I PWD, you\u0026rsquo;ll see I\u0026rsquo;m in the\nappetizer repository, I can go ahead and just run that command that I\ncopied and pasted. Now when I do this, what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen? What\u0026rsquo;s\ngoing to happen is the application is going to enroll that token, which you\ncan see it happened and that\u0026rsquo;s going to connect to a server. I\u0026rsquo;m going to\nbring up the diagram. Actually, I want to bring up the prettier diagram if I\ncan find it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 38:50\nLet me find it real quick, this one. So it\u0026rsquo;s going to contact a service that\nhas no listening ports that I stood up that will do one thing and it will\nreflect back to me or echo whatever I type. So if I say hi, then it\u0026rsquo;ll say hi\nand it\u0026rsquo;ll say you sent me hi. Now, what also happens that you\u0026rsquo;re not seeing\nthis is normal stuff. I challenge you to find this service on the open\nInternet. You won\u0026rsquo;t find it at appetizer openZ IO because it\u0026rsquo;s all\napplication embedded. So this has no listening ports anywhere. But you\ncan try to find it, you won\u0026rsquo;t. But what happened here is I\u0026rsquo;ve sent a\nmessage up into the cloud, in this case an Amazon Fargate where this\nthing is running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 39:41\nAnd I have a server that\u0026rsquo;s running up there accepting connections on the\noverlay network, not on the IP based underlay network. And it\u0026rsquo;s returned\nback to me, this text. And so that\u0026rsquo;s what it\u0026rsquo;s done. Also what it\u0026rsquo;s done is\nit\u0026rsquo;s looked at my input and decided if the input was profanity. So I added a\nGo library to check for profanity. And then we did something even cooler.\nWe have another service that can deploy it out there. In fact, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\nwas sharing my screen, so I\u0026rsquo;m sorry about that. We have another service\nthat Ken deployed and that service is doing language model work. It\u0026rsquo;s a\ntext classifier. So AI being all the rage, right? Everybody needs an AI\nservice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 40:27\nWe have a service that looks at my input and classifies it as to whether it\u0026rsquo;s\noffensive, I don\u0026rsquo;t know where Ken deployed his service. Think about\nmicroservices, right? Thinking about the what you do all day long. You got\nTeam A that does one thing. Team B, that does another thing. You need\nteam A to send traffic to team B. Team A has to say well, how do I\nwhitelist my IP? Here\u0026rsquo;s my IP. Blah. Right. None of that with openzd. Ken\nstood up a service, told me the name of the service and told me go dial it\nand that\u0026rsquo;s all I had to do. And so that language model is running out there\nsomewhere and I don\u0026rsquo;t know where Ken put it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 41:02\nSo if I do something like say I hate babies, then you\u0026rsquo;re going to see, hey,\nyour message seems to be offensive and we are not going to relay it. Also,\nif you will notice in our oh, Clint is a dingleberry. Somebody is being a\nfunny dude right now. That\u0026rsquo;s really interesting. Who hates babies? I\nwouldn\u0026rsquo;t have expected that to kit through our language classifier. But\nyou can see somebody else is actually using this right now. I don\u0026rsquo;t know\nwho. This honestly wasn\u0026rsquo;t the plant. Hopefully it\u0026rsquo;s somebody on the chat, I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t know. So if I then say I like babies, you can see what I didn\u0026rsquo;t show\nyou before is that the service also reflects the message back into your\nscreen right here. And if you wanted to have somebody else play along,\nyou could just send them to messages. Messages. M-E-S-S-A-G-E-S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 42:00\nHTML spell it wrong. Too many s\u0026rsquo;s, maybe too many S\u0026rsquo;s, I think. And they\ncan also get the messages too. Like example. So that is application\nembedded zero trust working. We have sent message from my computer\nhere in western New York up into the cloud to a server that has no\nlistening ports. That server sent traffic to another server that was doing\nlanguage model identification using Python. Oh, I should mention, I wrote\nit in go. Ken wrote it in Python. You can find that also on the test kitchen\nGitHub account too. And then it returned a response and I printed it out\nhere and you can see the latency that incurs. Here is an example. If I hit\nenter, you can see basically instantaneous pops up back on my screen. So\ncommon question is what kind of latency can you expect?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 42:54\nHumans never notice it. Now, I also did one more thing using application\nembedded zero trust. I actually created a little bot in my application and\nevery time a message is sent to our demo application here, it actually pops\nup here in mattermost and it tells me I hate babies. If were to go look at\nthis one, if we look at them both at the same time and see which one gets\nthe message and which one doesn\u0026rsquo;t get the message, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that the\nmessage that\u0026rsquo;s reflected publicly doesn\u0026rsquo;t come through. But the message\nthat might be offensive is put in our chat message here. And so I can then\ndecide is this actually offensive? Is it not offensive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 43:39\nAnd maybe we could doesn\u0026rsquo;t do this right yet because I just made this\ndemo literally today, but maybe someday that yes button will train our\nlanguage model so it can learn that this is offensive or that\u0026rsquo;s not offensive,\nand that\u0026rsquo;s all entirely secure. I don\u0026rsquo;t know where Ken deployed it, so just\nthink about multi cloud solutions now, right? If he deployed it in Azure, I\nwould have no clue that I deployed it in Azure while mine runs in Amazon.\nAnd I think that\u0026rsquo;s kind of mind blowing. So hopefully you think that\u0026rsquo;s mind\nblowing, too. Now, that\u0026rsquo;s my demo. I hope you enjoyed it. You can go out\nto the test kitchen. Like I said, let\u0026rsquo;s skip past all of this. That was my\ndemo. Opencd has all kinds of other Zdefied, as we call it, apps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 44:20\nWe have ZSS, which is neat because you can SSH here to a place without\nhaving a port open, right? You can deny all the firewall rules like Ken did\nwhen Ken deployed that service. Ken used Openzd to basically be the\nbastion, if you would, the entry point to that server. He can only access his\nserver via Openzd. We use SCP as part of the ZSS package. Some\nexamples we have mattermost. You saw me doing mattermost. That\nmattermost server that I just it\u0026rsquo;s a chat app, which is equivalent to Slack\nor Discord or something like that. But self hostable. That Mattermost\nserver that you just saw me accessing that I was messaging, can only be\nmessaged via Openzd because it\u0026rsquo;s protected by Openzd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 45:11\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s a good example of the tunneler based approach and an\nEmbedding not Embedding joining an application embedded zero trust\napproach with a Brownfield existing app. We send messages from GitHub\nall the time to my Mattermost. So when I get a notification oh, there\u0026rsquo;s Ken\nright there. When I get a notification that a commit has happened or that\nClint approved a message, I\u0026rsquo;ll get a notification from GitHub in my\nMattermost. But the only way to hit that Mattermost service is via\nOpenzd. So there\u0026rsquo;s a Zdefied webhook for that. Zdbc. Actually, Marcos\nhas talked at a security summit in the past about me. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t seen\nthat one, go check it out. Really good one. Great. Marcos, great job\npresenting works with all your databases out there because it\u0026rsquo;s not\nbespoke per database. So it works with Postgres, Oracle, you name it,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 46:10\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just about poking the JDBC driver in the right way. Have good blog\nposts about it. Cubezetle helm. I\u0026rsquo;m going to just skip all through these\nbecause you can go out there and check them out on your own.\nPrometheus actually one of my favorites here. I have a complicated\nPrometheus example where we have a Prometheus server that\u0026rsquo;s scraping\nKubernetes over the Openzd overlay, where the Kubernetes control plane is\nentirely off the overlay before it had to be on the Open Internet. And you\nhave a Kubernetes ingress after you have kubernetes API. Totally hidden,\ntotally private kubernetes. And yet Prometheus can still scrape it from\nanywhere. Cool blog post. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested, let us know. Zdefi is also\nneat. Very important. Every country, I believe, not just the United States, is\nnow issuing executive orders that secure infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 47:03\nInfrastructure must be secured by a Zero Trust mechanism of some flavor,\nobviously why it\u0026rsquo;s relevant in today\u0026rsquo;s world. It\u0026rsquo;s mentioned eleven times in\nthat document. Here are the Pillars of Zero. Trust. And you\u0026rsquo;re thinking to\nyourself, clint, what a great job. What a great demo. Blew my mind. Put\nthis in a cart. Let me bring it home. How do I go get it? Well, like I said\nbefore, we are out on GitHub. You can go to oh my goodness. Shame on\nme. Openzd GitHub. IO is no longer the URL. It is currently openzd. IO is\nthe URL. So I\u0026rsquo;ll have to go and fix that. That\u0026rsquo;s where you\u0026rsquo;ll find our\ndocumentation and GitHub. We\u0026rsquo;re on GitHub at Slash Openzd so you can\nfind us on all our socials here. You can follow me and Ken weekly. We\u0026rsquo;ll do\na ZDTV out on YouTube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 47:53\nWe have a Twitter handle while Twitter is still around. And look at that.\nSlide is so old. Still got the old bird. Who wants to go to X, right? Nobody\nwants to go to X. We have a discourse group where you can hit us up in\ndiscourse, where you can ask questions and whatnot. And if I can ask one\nthing of you, it\u0026rsquo;s to go to our GitHub repository openzd, and give us that\nstar. That star does mean a lot to us. It helps other people know that ZD is\na cool project and people should check it out. If you look at our star\nprogression here, you can see we\u0026rsquo;re picking up some steam. So hopefully\nyou all who watch this can bump this up way higher. Let\u0026rsquo;s see another big\nspike. And yeah, give us that star. And that\u0026rsquo;s the whole thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClint Dovholuk - 48:35\nThat\u0026rsquo;s application embedded. Zero Trust. I hope you\u0026rsquo;ve enjoyed it. Hope\nthe presentation was exciting. And if you have any questions, hit us up on\nthose socials. All right?

that does the security testing of your applications and APIs can be deployed anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKim will briefly discuss the four year journey that has brought PurpleTeam from a

a Build User (DevSecOps practitioner) to customise their Test Runs without having to write any tests by simply configuring a Job file.\nAllowing multiple options to deal with false/true

that PurpleTeam solves, such as training the Build User with advice and tips on security defects as you fix the defects that PurpleTeam highlights.\nAs well as the huge cost savings of finding and fixing your application and infrastructure security defects early (as you\u0026rsquo;re introducing them) as opposed to late (weeks or months later with external penetration testing) or not at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"ok-i-want-it-how-do-wei-set-it-up\"\u003eOK, I want it, how do we/I set it up?\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKim will walk you through all of the components and how to

I can say a few words to start just but anybody\nelse can. Yeah, not pushing free. I think the topic is overlapping with the\ntopic of how does cybersecurity talk to management or how does a CISO\ntalk to the executive team. Here is a bit more specific because based on\nthe headline we\u0026rsquo;re talking about the risk professionals, but in principle\ntalking to executive I would imagine is the executive team or could even be\nthe board, depending on the situation because the board has typically risk\nresponsibility. So it probably is a two level thing. One is the executive side\nand the other one is the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 01:18\nAnd to launch a bit as a discussion and to make it a bit kind of black and\nwhite where we can paint the gray levels later is what I noticed in my\nconsulting practice is that many CISOs or many senior guys or even risk\nprofessionals are typically even the CISOs are very technical in many ways\nand because most of the problems they have to solve are very technical\nsometimes they are part of it, sometimes they\u0026rsquo;re separate from it.\nSometimes they report to the CFO or to someone. They are maybe one\nlayer or two layer away from the executive management team. And they\nare very often, most of them, very technical. And so one of the big\nchallenges is to talk the same language between these two sites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 02:24\nOne, the executive management does not understand the technical things,\nthe technical guys doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand the management things. So we have\nto find a way to talk the same language. And I think generally speaking,\nthe first step is for the cybersecurity or the risk professionals to acquire a\nbit of management know how. I think especially security costs a lot more\nthese days. We have to behave like any other department in a company\nhaving management know how, talking the same language, understanding\nthe way the company is managed independently of technical area is one\nvery big thing. The other thing is clearly education of the executive, maybe\na topic by itself. What is practical, what is acceptable on that height\ndepends a bit on the style of the companies, the small company, medium\nsized company, MNC, what does it mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 03:32\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s what I would say, just to get the discussion going a bit\ngeneral, but we can go in the specific aspect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 03:44\nI\u0026rsquo;m happy to just pick up on that. I think you make some very good points\nthere and I completely agree that there is an issue around finding common\nlanguage. One thing that I would throw out there is that I\u0026rsquo;ve always felt\nthat one of the issues is that boards, for example, think that cybersecurity\nis essentially a technology or an It conversation and they don\u0026rsquo;t identify\nthat as being an area where they have expertise. And when you\u0026rsquo;re on a\nboard or you are a senior exec, you don\u0026rsquo;t really like to show your\nvulnerabilities and lack of knowledge. So particularly when it\u0026rsquo;s going\ndown a specialist route, then actually that essentially means that they\nprobably don\u0026rsquo;t contribute as much as they would want to because they\ndon\u0026rsquo;t want to showcase that lack of knowledge or that vulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 04:36\nAnd I think that part of the issue is that cybersecurity from a board\nperspective, for example, or an exco perspective, is not an It conversation,\nit\u0026rsquo;s not a technology conversation, it\u0026rsquo;s a risk management conversation.\nAnd when you change the chip in a lot of these individuals, where you say\nto them, maxine, it\u0026rsquo;s a risk management conversation, and you would\nhappily contribute to risk management in pretty much every area of the\nbusiness, regardless. Whether you have expertise or not, then apply the\nsame level of know how and general management skill set, et cetera, that\nyou would have in any risk management conversation and kind of go from\nthere. And like a very practical example for me is you want to protect the\ncrown jewels of your organization from a cybersecurity perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 05:22\nEverybody wants that now the cybersecurity team or the security team will\nbe able to do that, but they\u0026rsquo;re not the ones who should decide what the\ncrown jewels are. That really is a decision for the board or for XCO. So\nthat is a good example for me where you have risk management as a sort\nof overlay and then you figure out what you can contribute towards that\nconversation and then you have different parts playing a role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 05:44\nI think one item, and I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 05:49\nThat was the end of my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 05:50\nI think some of you and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure which industries you are working, so\nit may be a little bit different. Some of you who are at least in EU will be\nwho are for example, in the financial industry will fall under Dora\nregulation soon. Normally that\u0026rsquo;s end of 2024, beginning 2025. And Dora\nspecifies that the supervisor, the management body, which is basically both\nthe executive team and the board, have to have the proper know how. And\nI was facing even regulators a year back which in their audits brought up\nthe point that the management needs to have the know how, needs to be\ninvolved, needs to take the time. And that\u0026rsquo;s one thing. So I think the topic\nof it\u0026rsquo;s no longer possible, at least for senior management to get away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 06:44\nIt\u0026rsquo;s now kind of black and white in some ways and some of them because\nof that or the future or the present, have chosen to get also advisors. The\nboard can have an advisor because it\u0026rsquo;s a bit independent on cybersecurity\nto help it in some ways. That\u0026rsquo;s one thing. The second thing is one of the\nproblem is that security guys, sometimes they report to CIO or not.\nSometimes even the CIO is not part of the executive team. So there is a\nnumber of topics, not only cybersecurity topics, which are not necessarily\nwell understood, even at executive team level, depending on the company\nto throw more oil to the.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 07:34\nSo I would like to add a few things on this. So first of all, my name is\nMatric, I\u0026rsquo;m a technical architect. I\u0026rsquo;m working for one of the largest MSP\nproviders in Oxford, in the UK. And that\u0026rsquo;s what our job is on a daily basis,\njust to speak to obviously executives and the right people within the\nindustry. And as Guill and Danny said, I think it\u0026rsquo;s important to us to make\nsure that we\u0026rsquo;re speaking to those executives, to the people who are\nactually making the decision, because security, data protection and all of\nthose things that we\u0026rsquo;re talking about, they actually start from the top. So\nobviously, people that we\u0026rsquo;re speaking to, they need to decide whether they\nwant to go for the changes within their business and that\u0026rsquo;s where it starts\nfrom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 08:24\nSo I think it\u0026rsquo;s quite important, as Danny, as you mentioned, speaking to\nthe right people at the top of the organization because we know that it\nwon\u0026rsquo;t start from down and then obviously everything starts from the top\nand the main decisions are being made at the top. So this is why this is so\nimportant to speak to someone who\u0026rsquo;s actually making those decisions.\nPlus, obviously, as we all know, and you can probably all agree that we live\nin a crazy world at the moment, where data needs to be super protected.\nBecause with all of those SaaS solutions and everything, we actually keep\nthe data everywhere and we need to have the right solutions to make sure\nthat the data is protected, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 09:07\nI think the main point is just to make sure that we\u0026rsquo;re speaking to someone\nat the top of the chain who is making those decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 09:20\nI think sometimes there\u0026rsquo;s a few things I think sometimes overlooked when\nwe\u0026rsquo;re talking about, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of talking about CISO has to be\ntechnical. But at the same time, I think one thing that\u0026rsquo;s overlooked more\noften than not is the soft skills. Because when you land yourself in a CISO\nposition, the first thing and foremost you should get to know your\nexecutive team. So you have to align your communication style, whether\nsomeone\u0026rsquo;s technical, whether someone\u0026rsquo;s managerial, how do you deliver\nyour risk communication across various parts of the C suite? So you need\nto know how you can present stuff that they will understand, align those\ncommunication lines, align their knowledge and their perspectives. The\nfirst thing I think, when you get to meet them, ask what\u0026rsquo;s keeping them up\nat night, what kind of risks are in their particular area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 10:17\nBecause when you get the buy in and you can deliver value to executives,\nthen you can build those communication lines and actually get something\ndone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 10:25\nI think what\u0026rsquo;s happening also is that some CSOs and risk professionals,\nsometimes it\u0026rsquo;s not only the same common language and sort of make it\nclear, but there are other things which are lacking. The senior guy, the\nexecutive, may ask you, so where\u0026rsquo;s your security strategy? Do you have a\ndocument explaining where you want to go? Do you have a roadmap? Do\nyou have any KPIs? Do you have metrics? We can see every monthly\nupdate on the risks. How are the metrics and the KPI you\u0026rsquo;re doing and\nwhere you\u0026rsquo;re going in the future? I think it\u0026rsquo;s a kind of a mix of things\nwhich are typical for a management discussion. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing unique for\nsecurity, but this is what they would ask anybody who would bring up\nsomething of interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 11:18\nIn some ways, I think these instruments or these elements, we must have to\nfit in the management, let\u0026rsquo;s say logic in something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 11:32\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why actually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 11:36\nWell, I totally in agreement with all that have been said so far. I mean,\nbased on my experience, I mean, working with the executives from a\ngovernance, a GRC perspective. So based on the challenges that I\u0026rsquo;ve\nactually encountered dealing with the powers that be within this\norganization as it relates to risk communication, I have actually been able\nto develop a strategic approach to actually dealing with this challenge\nbased on the fact that, as you have rightly said, the executives have a\nparticular mindset they think a certain way. So in order to deal with this, I\nnormally approach this from a more strategic point of view. And I\u0026rsquo;ve\nactually developed a particular, I would say maybe a system that I\nnormally use to deal with this sort of a situation. Normally, I would, for\nexample, ask I need to first understand how do executives think?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 12:33\nWhat is it that they are thinking about in their boardroom? How do they\nactually process? What are they communicating? What are the\nconversations that they have within these boardroom conversations? And\nthen I need to understand, for example, how it is that the business\ngenerates revenue. I mean, the bottom line, what is it that\u0026rsquo;s actually\ncontributing most to the organization, and in terms of what perspective do\nthey have on risk? So with that alignment, with that understanding, then\nI\u0026rsquo;m able to align what it is that I\u0026rsquo;m communicating with their overall\nbusiness activities within that organization. So that is the way that I\u0026rsquo;ve\nactually been able to proactively or positively been able to work with the\nexecutives to get them along, as you say, in terms of buying and\nunderstanding better from a cybersecurity perspective, risk perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 13:32\nAnd can I just building on that, based on that experience, do you feel that\nyou add as much value to them as they add value to you? Is it a real 50 52\nway or is it more you\u0026rsquo;re adding more value all the other way around? How\nwould you see it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 13:51\nWell, I would say depending well, based on the environments that I\u0026rsquo;ve\nactually been in, I have actually worked along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 13:59\nIt depends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 14:01\nYou have people that are really quite receptive. You have those that are\nlike they could care less as to what I mean, at the end of the day, it\u0026rsquo;s all\nabout they making generating revenue. But I think it all depends. Based\non my experience, it varies. At times it\u0026rsquo;s a 50, at times it\u0026rsquo;s more of maybe a\n60 30. So that\u0026rsquo;s where the challenge is. I have to bridge that gap to create\nthat alignment, to ensure that they\u0026rsquo;re actually achieving. We\u0026rsquo;re all on the\nsame wavelength in terms of meeting business objectives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 14:30\nYeah, I think also what you need is not all the executives. There may be, of\ncourse, the CEO, the managing director, or the board, the chairman of the\nboard, and so on. Of course there\u0026rsquo;s a collection of individuals. All these\nindividuals have different roles and their risk appetite is actually different\nand what they want in life is very different. So it\u0026rsquo;s also you have to\nunderstand a bit, if you can and you said talking to them also helps to\nunderstand the politics going on. Maybe for one, you are one who is\nsaving his job because to avoid that, we have a breach. For the other one,\nyou are basically a cost factor which has to be minimized. The other 1\nmay think that you could possibly disrupt the processes of the company or\nsomething.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 15:20\nI think using any opportunity to expose yourself, to work with them, to\nunderstand them better, to find the right angle and the right not only\nlanguage but also political angle is really important. I think that\u0026rsquo;s the\nsame amongst themselves for other topics. It\u0026rsquo;s not unique to cybersecurity.\nYou have to navigate also but sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 15:49\nJust briefly, I think the issue there though, is that\u0026rsquo;s when you\u0026rsquo;ve got a\nproblem, right, when you\u0026rsquo;re working with a board or an exco that has an\nindividualistic approach to what they\u0026rsquo;re hoping cybersecurity is going to\nbe. And I think ideally, just based on what we have heard so far, the whole\npoint is that you have to work with the board to educate them and create\nthat 50 relationship to make sure that there\u0026rsquo;s only one mission and then\neverybody\u0026rsquo;s working to the same mission. Because I think what you just\nsaid is so true. If you\u0026rsquo;re a cost concern for one and you\u0026rsquo;re a savior for\nanother, then how are you going to be able to bring everybody together?\nBut if you have one mission that embodies everybody, then you\u0026rsquo;ve got\nsomething you can work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 16:31\nI think if I could elaborate on this one also, I like what actually Marius\nsaid once. We need to find that simple language first to speak to someone,\nbecause obviously the executives within the companies, they may not be\ntechnical. I mean, they don\u0026rsquo;t need to be technical and we just need to find\nthe language essentially to create the documents. I mean, one of the\ntechniques that we\u0026rsquo;re using and the company that I work for is we write\nthose documents like strategies for the companies. And this is a\nnontechnical language first just to approach that conversation with those\nexecutives. And then obviously later on we\u0026rsquo;ll explain to know in technical\nmatters why this is important and things like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 17:13\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s really important to at least at the beginning, if you know that\nyou\u0026rsquo;re speaking, as Marius said, to someone who is not technical, just to\nexplain know why this is important and just the simplest language as\npossibly can be so they can understand the risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 17:29\nYeah, I think one thing that sometimes is missing when we start\ncommunicating risk to the board the great way, and when you obviously\nbuild on those soft skills, you become a storyteller because obviously most\nof the executives, all they care about is the bottom line. So how can you\nrelate your risk mitigation tactics that it delivers to the business bottom\nline? Because sometimes as security professionals, tend to talk about\nspecific critical risks, but that does not mean anything to them unless it\nrelates to bottom line and business goals and business direction. So I think\nthat\u0026rsquo;s key in how you can create and craft your storytelling into that it\ndelivers to the business bottom line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 18:17\nAdding to that, in the past I came across many people who got the\nattention of the executives by fear, if we don\u0026rsquo;t do this, we\u0026rsquo;re going to die.\nThat I think, is okay. You can use that once or twice, but you cannot use\nthat as your typical model. You have to go beyond that. I think\nunderstanding where you come in, where this particular risk impacts\nproduction, where it impacts customer satisfaction, where it impacts\nfinancial things, talking that language over time is the better way. The fear\nworks a little bit at the beginning. But I think also what I see is that most,\nand that may help in this discussion, most executives actually, or at least\nmost senior guys in the executives, they are aware that things go wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 19:09\nIf things go wrong, they are going to be in the front line, they\u0026rsquo;re going to\nbe visible. Yeah. So I think they are nervous these days. I think that was\nnot the case two or three years ago. I think these days they are aware that\nit is their job or they are involved in either avoidance and also solving the\nproblem and so on. And I think what they have in their mind is are we\ndoing the right thing in this company? That\u0026rsquo;s what they have in their mind,\nor are we investing enough? And so on. Have we understood what\u0026rsquo;s going\non? They may not be tested technical specialists, but all the executives\ntypically are very smart guys. They may not be deep technical, but they\ncertainly can ask the right questions. Up to us to be able to sort of feed\nthem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 20:04\nI totally agree with you there. I\u0026rsquo;m actually seeing a shift where as you\nmentioned rightly, that the executives are no longer archaic in terms of\nwhat they think. They are no more abreast with cybersecurity happenings.\nThey see the various breaches incidents, the impact to the organization.\nSo as you have rightly said, they are thinking about RVC, what can we do?\nSo I normally take the advantage of that to build a relationship. That\u0026rsquo;s\none of my things that I normally do. To try to build a strong relationship\nas best as possible wherever I can to ensure that we are actually\ncommunicating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 20:46\nSo once we have that trust, we have that relationship where possible, then\nit\u0026rsquo;s easier for me to actually communicate and bring the importance of\nensuring that whatever it is that we are doing from a cybersecurity\nperspective is actually in the interest of the organization to ensure that\nthey\u0026rsquo;re operating securely as it relates to risk mitigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 21:16\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to ask a question guys, and I wanted to see what you guys think\nbecause obviously talking about risk, the problem we tend to have in\ncybersecurity industry is that we are usually in a firefighting mode. We\ndiscover risks, we build mitigation practices for how we\u0026rsquo;re going to\naddress the risk and then we move on and then we discover new risks. But\nI think the problem that normally happens in the industry is that we never\ngo deep enough to understand why specific risks are happening because if\nwe go deeper and build those communication lines and address potentially\nbusiness processes, business practices to prevent those risks from\nhappening again, we probably deliver better value to the business. So\nwhat\u0026rsquo;s your guys thoughts on that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 22:07\nI would think that my experience is 50% of the risks we see are coming\nfrom bad guys who are creative for the new way to do something bad.\nYeah. 50% of the risks are typically created by the company internally,\nbased on what you said, because they had a quick way to organically\ndevelop It applications in the past because they wanted to have a customer\nsatisfaction, they want quick results. And so there were a few shortcuts or\nsomeone is easy going on third parties because that\u0026rsquo;s a way to do cost\ndown. So let\u0026rsquo;s do quickly but in principle by not having the proper process\nor at least the minimum proper process or minimum due diligence, these\nadd to the risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 22:53\nBut they are risks which are produced by the company itself and I think\nhighlighting those and say well, these ones we control, the other ones we\nhave to work around the bad guys new techniques, we\u0026rsquo;re not in the driving\nseat, but we certainly can try to protect ourselves. I would say 50, I would\nsay. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that\u0026rsquo;s just a ballpark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 23:20\nBut I think it\u0026rsquo;s a really good point actually because a lot of this as you said\nearlier, is about the risk when it happens. But a lot of work can go into\ndefining risks. And if you take the time and if boards and executive\ncommittees working with cybersecurity professionals take the time to, I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t know, commission an audit of their digital estates across all of their\nhardware, software, legacy systems, data, et cetera, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of work.\nBut the more you do in terms of prep, the better the risk conversation is\ngoing to be down the line when something happens. So I think a lot of this\nis if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to invest jointly working together security professionals\nwith ESCOs on actually defining risk, then you\u0026rsquo;ll have a far greater\nchance of being able to deal with it when it emerges later on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 24:07\nYeah, because I\u0026rsquo;m just kind of alluded to the fact that if you look at the\nstatistics, every year we spend more and more on cybersecurity and we get\nmore and more breaches. So just take, for example, if you take an\napplication security program, normally what happens is we add more\ntools, we add more people just to try and solve all the vulnerabilities that\nwe have, but where the actual problem is our coding practices. So if we\nactually improved our quality of the code and the quality of the coding\npractices, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to throw money at the tools, at vulnerability\ndiscoveries and patching and all of that. So that\u0026rsquo;s where I\u0026rsquo;m coming from\nin that sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 24:53\nI think also what makes it a bit difficult and it\u0026rsquo;s basically a segregation of\nduty things, sometimes in these meetings a Security Responsible Risk\nManager, or CISO, cannot always say exactly what he\u0026rsquo;s thinking. That is\none problem because if he does say that basically shoots the CIO with the\nexample, you know, it\u0026rsquo;s the same guy he has to work tomorrow with. And\nso it\u0026rsquo;s about finding ways to, on the one side speak out and point the\nfinger, but on the other hand to find, let\u0026rsquo;s say, quote unquote, a diplomatic\nway to not solve one problem and make another one tomorrow out of it.\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s a bit politics, but you have to navigate in some ways. Unfortunately,\nin some cases, that psychological border has been already overcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 25:53\nI think that goes to the fact that I\u0026rsquo;ve been discussing a lot lately as well as\nthis. There are companies who need to understand the reasons for hiring a\nCISO. I\u0026rsquo;ve been discussing a lot of job descriptions where the top line of\nthe job description of a CISO is I need ISO 27,001, I need SoC two, type\ntwo, I need PCI, DSS, and that\u0026rsquo;s all we need. Or because another\ncompany told us, oh, we should have a CISO, but we haven\u0026rsquo;t thought or\nwe haven\u0026rsquo;t thought about supporting lines. And that\u0026rsquo;s why there\u0026rsquo;s many\ndiscussions about why CISO should not report to the CIO because there\nshouldn\u0026rsquo;t be no politics games. You should be able to tell exactly to the\nexecutives what\u0026rsquo;s wrong in the business. And if you need to play politics\ngames, then it\u0026rsquo;s wrongly set up and it\u0026rsquo;s wrongly supported security\nfunction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 26:45\nI totally agree. But it\u0026rsquo;s a bit company by company dependent. Some things\nyou change over time. It\u0026rsquo;s not you have a given situation, I think, when\nyou come in, but it\u0026rsquo;s not ideal. And I agree. That\u0026rsquo;s why, in my experience,\nalso separating security from it, from the CIO is one important case\nbecause half of the problems come from it. Typically, then, if they\u0026rsquo;re not\nreporting to CIO, to whom do they report? Do they report to the CFO or\ndoes he report to a COO or a CTO? Do we have at least an exceptional\nseat in the executive meetings or not? One has to also fight for that. So\nyou have to fight in some sense or evolve in some sense to get the seat at\nthe table and hopefully be there reasonably. You should be able to\nreasonably speak your mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 27:43\nIt will never be 100%, but I think at least be able to get the message in\nclear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 27:51\nYeah, what actually Mario said it\u0026rsquo;s quite interesting. He actually said,\nmore tools and more practices we\u0026rsquo;re using. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter. And\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been in those conversations with executives. Whether they said to me\nor to the team that I\u0026rsquo;m working with, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. We\u0026rsquo;re not going to\nchange this because obviously something will happen. But that\u0026rsquo;s not the\nright conversation. I mean, you need to make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re putting\nthose tools in place. Again, as I mentioned previously, we live in a crazy\nworld where obviously the bad guys will try to get to the data within a\ncompany. So, yeah, we just need to make sure that those conversations are\nproper conversations with the businesses, and the businesses are going for\nthe right solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 28:40\nUnfortunately, you come to the conclusion, and it\u0026rsquo;s not a good one, that an\noccasional breach is helpful because it resets many of the bad practices in\nsome ways. Obviously, nobody wants the bad things to happen, but it\nmakes this alignment a bit faster. If nothing has ever happened, then\nanybody can see anything forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 29:10\nI think the best sometimes what we can do is just to make sure that\nobviously it\u0026rsquo;s a harder job for the bad actors to essentially steal the data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 29:23\nYeah, it\u0026rsquo;s just about as well. It\u0026rsquo;s a one piece about governance as well. I\u0026rsquo;ve\nbeen talking with various executives as well. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s funnily eluded\nas Chief Information Scapegoat Officer instead of Chief Information\nSecurity Officer, because if you are highlighting things and especially bad\npractices and specific risks in your organization, how do you document\nthat? How do you get exceptions? How do you get acceptance of the risk?\nBecause you have to make sure that this is documented because you\nobviously done your job. Whether executives accept the risk or whether\nthey decide to mitigate, that\u0026rsquo;s up to them. But how do you document that\npractice and making sure that it\u0026rsquo;s obviously all evidenced? That\u0026rsquo;s another\nvery important part of the job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 30:11\nI totally agree with what you have actually said there. Well I think one of\nthe greatest challenge as it relates to based on what I\u0026rsquo;ve actually\nexperienced so far in all of this in terms of the communication is actually\nhaving to deal with the existing organizational culture and at times having\nto find various practices to break this culture to actually make sense,\ngetting a feedback. Okay, so having that proper governance structure in\nplace actually mean makes a difference as Marius is actually alluded to\njust a while ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 30:58\nYeah, I think culture is very important. As know I\u0026rsquo;ve talked to the\nexecutives know you can have a nice poster in the kitchen that says we are\na collaborative company. But if you are incentivizing only say one person\nand the best person in the team, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to get collaboration\nbecause only the best one is going to win. So why would I collaborate with\nsomeone else? So it\u0026rsquo;s always a top down approach. So how do you create\na collaborative culture? How do you involve everyone? And I think that\u0026rsquo;s\nwhat we kind of alluded as well. So yes, scare tactics and scare mongering\nworks once or twice, but third time you\u0026rsquo;re probably no longer invited to\nthe table. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s been known security to be as a no sort of\ndepartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 31:45\nAnd actually I said to my team the other day, I said when did the last time\nwe said no to the business? And nobody could remember. Because you\ncan\u0026rsquo;t do that because the more you say no, the less you are listened to. So\nhow do we say yes, but can we do this with these specific security\nrequirements in place and instead of using a stick, using a carrot because\neveryone extension, essentially everyone in your business is an extension of\nsecurity team. They will be able to help and highlight specific risks,\nspecific malpractices, if they are listened to, supported and welcome to\nhighlight things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 32:27\nYeah, I think that\u0026rsquo;s absolutely right. I think on the culture also is what we\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure we\u0026rsquo;ll all advocate, but celebrating successes and celebrating just\ngood instances where you never want to be in a culture where people feel\nlike they can\u0026rsquo;t put their hand up in an organization because they might\nhave identified a potential breach or whatever. It might, you know, just\nanything that involves celebrating somebody making the right sort of\ndecision or judgment or whatever it might be. I think top down and the\ninverse has got to be the way forward. So yeah, I agree, culture is the very\nbeginning of it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 33:04\nI think also giving certain problems you cannot solve in one day or one\nmonth. It will take one year, two years, three years. So you have to a little\nbit announce a color. Here is short term things. Here\u0026rsquo;s medium term\nthings. So you become predictable in some sense. It\u0026rsquo;s not this will cost\nlittle money, this will cost more money. And so forth. I think that\u0026rsquo;s okay.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s what everybody would do in a company and we have to do that too.\nCertain problems cannot be solved easily. I mean, obviously you have a\nburning thing, you solve it. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that. The second thing is you\nhave to come to a point where your opinion is trusted because every day\nyou have another problem. You cannot in a day by day explain in detail.\nDetail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 33:49\nSo at some point you have to come to the situation where your opinion\nand your advice is trusted because time is running. Yeah. And you have to\ndo things in the ground. You need to be able be in a situation where people\ntake they can ask a few questions, but in general they would trust your\nadvice in some ways knowing that you are not unrealistic or unreasonable\nin what you ask. I think that is also a point you have to reach so that\nthings move on because you can solve one problem today and be killed\ntomorrow. So you have to make sure that things move on. Showing the\ndirection over time your opinion is trusted after a while, maybe at the\nbeginning is a bit harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 34:38\nMake sure that you solve day by day problems because if you say things\nand tomorrow something stupid happens somewhere else. Your\ntrustworthy is affected in some ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 34:56\nAnd also I think it\u0026rsquo;s really important to segregate the issues within the\nbusinesses and just sort of highlight which issues are more urgent and\nwhich ones need to be remediated much faster than the others. And I\nthink, Maris, you\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned that obviously how do we track those\nchanges and things like this when we have those conversations with\npeople? And I think, again, from my experience, we keep the\ndocumentation. So for example, if we create a document for the\nbusinesses, this document may be for another 18 months or 20 months\nover almost a two year going forward the roadmap. And then obviously\nwe mark the urgencies of changing the segmented issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 35:49\nAnd then again, if we have a conversation with that executives or with a\ncompany in next two years, something hasn\u0026rsquo;t been done, but again,\nsomething has happened within that segment, then obviously that\u0026rsquo;s the\nissue. But at least we\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned that in the past. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s how\nthe conversation should also be sort of approached as well, just to\nsegment those issues, making sure which ones are more important than\nthe other. And again, every company is different. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s important\nto speak to someone who knows the culture within a company, who know\nhow the people work within that company. And again, it\u0026rsquo;s important also\nthat the businesses are not afraid, that the individuals are not afraid to say\nthat something has happened within a business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 36:40\nBecause, Danny, as you said, you\u0026rsquo;ve been working with a couple of\ncompanies that someone was scared to raise their hand and say, okay,\nsomething has happened because they\u0026rsquo;ve been afraid that they may be\npunished for whatever happened. But yeah, I think it\u0026rsquo;s important to\nsegmented those and making sure which ones are more urgent than the\nothers and just approach it this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 37:09\nI think sometimes as well talking about risk, I think the one thing that\nsometimes is really missing is we get to the fact of addressing risk at very\nlocal sort of level. And sometimes you need to look at macro and context\nbecause normally nowadays geni is obviously a different conversation but\nobviously we are getting more tools and more data points where we can\nmake more accurate decisions about risk, about the context, about\nbusiness, what\u0026rsquo;s happening in macroeconomic level. So hopefully with the\ntime going we can make better decisions moving forward to understand\nthe context in where the business is operating, what are specific risks to\nthat business within their own environment, but also with a bigger sort of\neconomic scale on what\u0026rsquo;s happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 38:01\nI think one thing I can recommend in general because in my case I was\nfacing in the past, I was facing the management, the board, but also I was\nfacing many different business units which had also very a lot of\nindependence. It\u0026rsquo;s not like only just the top, but also horizontally you can\nsee I think one thing which always helped is that and it was an investment\ndecision is to invest in analytics. Yeah, I was able to invest a percentage of\nmy budget to build analytics again, I could show numbers to everybody,\nnumbers per month, numbers evolution, numbers per business unit, who is\ndoing better, you can say okay, this one is doing very bad, this one is doing\nwell. It\u0026rsquo;s very powerful to compare in the same company, two different\nbehaviors but the numbers don\u0026rsquo;t come easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 38:52\nYou have to have building analytics system. It takes one year, two years,\nthree year. You have to have a bit of an idea where you go because the\ndata is all over the place. You have to measure it, you have to build it, you\nhave to put metal layers above it so that you can represent data. But it is\none of the guaranteed, I would say 100% or 99% sure way to get the\nreturn of investment in terms of moving away from judgments only and\nsubstantiating things. And the numbers are very powerful, especially when\nyou compare behaviors between divisions because someone says well,\nwhat you ask is unreasonable, but then you show the numbers well, this\none did it already and you are not doing it inside the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 39:33\nComparisons is very powerful versus just saying well, something is wrong\nif you can show someone has already solved the problem and here\u0026rsquo;s the\nnumbers and someone has not and here\u0026rsquo;s the numbers. This takes away a\nlot of the problematic things especially when you have many business units\nhorizontally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 39:52\nYeah, and I think that feeds into risk monitoring because sometimes I\nwitnessed facts where we have a specific, say, risk, we developed a\nmitigation plan for that risk. We mitigated risk to an acceptable level. Yes,\nwe did that at this point in time. But sometimes organizations or some\nspecific risk professionals tend to, when you mitigate the risk on\nacceptable level, that risk is closed. But if you don\u0026rsquo;t have an adequate\nmonitoring, because this is a point in time exercise, how do you know\nwhat\u0026rsquo;s the risk output or the risk measurement within next 3612 months,\n18 months, that risk might completely change, and that mitigation might\nnot be adequate anymore in a time frame. So the monitoring of the risk\nand constant evaluation is very important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 40:42\nSome regulations ask you to do a risk assessment every twelve months,\nbut you have to gauge in your risk appetite where specific risks might need\nto be measured and assessed more often than every twelve months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 40:55\nYeah, 100% agree with this, because again, the plan for the businesses at\nthis point may not be the same within next twelve months. So constant\nconversation with the businesses, with executives, this is quite important\nas well. So you need as a business to schedule those conversations every\nsort of six to twelve months. Because again, what you said, and I\ncompletely agree with this, the plan of action for today may not be\nadequate within next twelve months, because again, the organization\ngrow, the cybersecurity may change, the threats may change, the system\nobviously is going to be outdated within that time. There are many factors\nthat has an impact on that. So scheduling those conversations within the\nright people, within a business, it\u0026rsquo;s 100% crucial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 41:53\nI had two examples. I had one case where someone, one managing\ndirector took one new risk every year as a focus for you, and he wanted\nreporting, how is everybody doing on that risk? And we of course have to\nstill take care of the previous year things. But it was instead of going all\ndirections, his way of thinking was, well, we have to take an objective\nevery year, one single or two objectives, and we solve that one and we add\nit to what we solved the years before. And this way, instead of having to\ntalk 25 different things or 25 different risks, there was a focus on getting a\ndeeper understanding per risk for one year, and then this was hopefully\nunderstood and we could move on to the next risk the next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 42:41\nThat was one way, which made it very clear, and he wanted details per\nbusiness unit, per department, how were doing on that risk. It was one\nway to move forward. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying it\u0026rsquo;s the only way. Sometimes you\nhave no choice. But if you have the choice, having focus points for\nmanagement, say, this year we focus on this, next year we focus on that.\nOf course, you choose the important ones in some ways where you and we\nwould get management support to solve that risk more than any other\nyear or any other way. That\u0026rsquo;s one management technique if you want to\nmove on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 43:18\nI think I actually quite like that. I like it\u0026rsquo;s novel. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting. Different\nway of looking at it. I do think though, that it\u0026rsquo;s important that the cyber\nrisks are very much part and parcel of the overall red amber green risk\nmanagement framework that any exco or board has, because the\nlikelihood is that the cyber risks are going to be right up there. And I think\nthen executives suddenly realize that out of six top risks, two or three are\ncyber related. And it really elevates the importance of the conversation as\na result when you\u0026rsquo;re able to compare the risk within the rest of the risks\nthat the organization faces and not see it as a separate one. So I think\nbringing it, as I say, as part of the overall risk management framework is\nreally important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 44:10\nYeah, because I think security, as we kind of all know, security can\u0026rsquo;t\nhappen in a silo. And I think sometimes, as we discussed previously, it\u0026rsquo;s\noften seen as It issue. But when you start expanding security into any\ndepartment, there is specific security system security risks that everyone\nfaces, whether it\u0026rsquo;s HR, whether it\u0026rsquo;s business development. And I think we\nas security professionals has a way to expand and go beyond it. And I\u0026rsquo;ve\nalways been a proponent, for example, how do we deliver value? Because\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been discussing as well in my previous post, normally how do created\nnarratives where security is not a cost center, security is a business\nenabler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 44:58\nSo how can we I created Slides as well for my business development guys\nabout how do we do security well for our proposal customers, that it\u0026rsquo;s safe\nfor their customers to hold data with us, how do we deliver business value\nfor our potential clients? So expanding that security sort of vision across\nvarious departments can really transcend how you deliver value as well as\naddress risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 45:27\nI think that is such a good point, Marius. I mean, the enabling that you\njust talked about, because I\u0026rsquo;m sure we\u0026rsquo;ve all seen a whole bunch of\npresentations where executive teams say, okay, item one, digital strategy.\nItem two, cybersecurity strategy. And you\u0026rsquo;re like, no, cybersecurity is the\nenabling part of your digital strategy. Don\u0026rsquo;t separate it. And I think that\nsort of positive good. Cybersecurity means growth, means greater\nrevenue, means greater opportunity, et cetera. That\u0026rsquo;s what it\u0026rsquo;s all about.\nAs opposed to, let\u0026rsquo;s have a separate session to talk about how we protect\nstuff. So I completely agree with you, and.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 46:04\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s why I lately been focusing because we keep talking about\nsecurity. But if we can transcend security into talking about as quality\nfunction, whether it\u0026rsquo;s code, whether it\u0026rsquo;s our It infrastructure, whether it\u0026rsquo;s\nprotecting our brand reputation, the more we build quality with security in\nmind, the better we deliver business value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 46:26\nI think you can position security under the logo enable business in an\nunsecure world. If you take that as your headline, it makes the discussion\na little bit easier. But it is true that depending on the business and the\nbusiness challenges, someone may be willing to take a hit somewhere if\nthat makes the business move faster. A security incident doesn\u0026rsquo;t cost\nnecessarily 100 million, but it could. But maybe an incident cost us 40,000\nor 50,000. Someone say well, okay, losing money is never good, but it\u0026rsquo;s\nsomething we can accept because if we would find a way around it would\nmake things more inefficient, we may lose more. So having a good\ndiscussion like that gives us a feeling, okay, what the priorities are. I had\nalso cases where certain top executives had go and no go things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 47:28\nThey were very sensitive to certain topics and zero tolerance for certain\nthings and they would be very much willing to have money discussion on\nothers. So I think that is also important that it\u0026rsquo;s finding out, because it\ngives you also priorities. Even for CISO, it avoids that you go run in all\ndirections. But the other one is when you look at for example, CRM\nsystems. I had cases like when we investigated, we found out that there\u0026rsquo;s\nlet\u0026rsquo;s say a million records in a CRM system. Yeah, only 20% get emailing.\nThe other ones are just registered. Registered. Nobody does everything. So\nwe said please, if you do not do anything with the 80%, please take some\noffline. We only should protect things which have economic value, which is\nobviously only the 20%. That is a change as totally as a direct discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 48:25\nOf course they are a bit shocked why we collect so much and we use a\nlittle okay, that discussion has to be done, but at least there is a logic to it\nand I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 48:36\nThink sometimes some other things as well. What we alluded in the\nbeginning is you need to understand the business because the risk\nmitigation the risk framework, the risk appetite will changes depends on\nyour organization. So if you walk into a bank, they\u0026rsquo;re obviously going to\nbe very risk aware and they\u0026rsquo;re obviously going to risk a lot less. Where if\nyou walk into a startup and you\u0026rsquo;re trying to grab as much of their market\nshare as possible because you just created the new product, you\u0026rsquo;re going\nto create more risks and you\u0026rsquo;re going to do more risk because you want to\ngrow fast and you want to grab as much of the market. When you reach a\ncertain maturity level, your risk appetite will change. So you need to be\naware of business context and where you are in that maturity sort of scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 49:19\nI think in some cases when you study your risk equation, you have to solve\nit, whatever it is. Maybe when the organization is bigger, but sometimes\nwhen the organization is smaller SMEs or others smaller, you have to first\nsimplify the risk equation before you solve it. Otherwise they cannot afford\nit, they cannot sustain it. In some sense, if you have 25 images on your\nendpoints and you have to do vulnerability management and patching,\nyou\u0026rsquo;re going to kill yourself possibly unless you\u0026rsquo;re helped in some way. So\nsometimes you have to find a way to simplify the equation first and then\nsolve it and not apply big money to solve the wrong problem. I think that\nalso gives the executive feeling that you are thinking about common sense\nand practical, economical ways to solve things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 50:16\nSure. And just to add to that important point is one of the things I\nnormally do is always to identify, going back to the basics, how does this\norganization, how does this business actually generates revenue? What are\nmy business assets? Not everything within the organization generates\nrevenue or contributes to that overall revenue generation. So I always\nhave my business assets. What are the risks to those business assets? What\nare the cyber risks to the business? What are the likelihood that risk can\nactually affect the business? What\u0026rsquo;s the associated cost if that risk actually\naffects the business and what\u0026rsquo;s the cost to fix it? So I always operate\nwithin that line in terms of simplifying my risk communication. Always\nkeep it as simple as best as possible for the executives to actually\nunderstand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 51:15\nSo whatever it is, always align, return on investment, always go back to\nrevenue generation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 51:26\nIn another way. I have seen some people who have been thinking, okay, I\nneed to reflex. I have $100,000 or euro in my pocket and I will solve this\nproblem by using 100,000 or 10,000. And because you\u0026rsquo;re given a budget,\nyou have to stay within it and you have to solve it. And there is sometimes\nthe wrong reflex also that instead of going to the right people and says, I\nneed a million to solve this problem because this is a very big problem, this\nsometimes is not done. So we\u0026rsquo;re kind of educated or trained or\nconditioned and it\u0026rsquo;s also not only me and the CISO, but even the layers\nbelow may sing in this way or they say, okay, I have to manage within that\nlevel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 52:18\nSo sometimes the risks don\u0026rsquo;t come up properly also this way because some\nsays, well, I know it\u0026rsquo;s a risk, but okay, I\u0026rsquo;m going to use my $10,000 to\nsolve it as much as I can rather than bringing it up and have the CISO ask\na million dollar to fix it or something like that. I think there\u0026rsquo;s another big\nproblem I see in this risk communication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 52:47\nI think we go a couple of minutes left. So any final thoughts from you\nguys?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 52:57\nI think communication, culture and enablement are some of the words\nthat really stick out for me over the last hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 53:10\nAnyone else? Pate, final words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 53:15\nI agree with Danny says now those three key points and obviously\nspeaking to the right people in the organization, that\u0026rsquo;s the key point as\nwell, the ones that understand the culture, how the organization works,\nand just to sort of those risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 53:37\nI was living in a Japanese company, and in a Japanese company, just\ndifference, maybe of an American company, you would not go to a meeting\nto have a debate. The discussions happen individually before the meeting.\nYeah, because it\u0026rsquo;s not possible to have agreement on with 1012 people,\npossibly. But it\u0026rsquo;s possible to discuss in depth, frankly, with individual\nmembers beforehand and to try to move to reasonable consensus when the\nformal meeting is happening. Which is more formal or ceremony in some\nsense. That\u0026rsquo;s a Japanese way of doing it. It\u0026rsquo;s not you don\u0026rsquo;t expose anybody\npublicly, you don\u0026rsquo;t attack someone publicly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 54:26\nBut you spend a lot of time in the preparation of the meeting with\ndifferent individuals to get their point of view, to explain your point of\nview, which you can do typically in a much more frank way beforehand, so\nthat you can crystallize a proposal where you get a majority support at the\nend. But that\u0026rsquo;s the culture of a Japanese company versus maybe others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 54:51\nYeah, and I would say it\u0026rsquo;s very important as well. We discussed get to the\nbottom of the problem, so I don\u0026rsquo;t remember which book it was, but it said,\nask five why questions to get to the bottom and the root cause of why\nthings are happening. Because we need to move away from firefighting\ninto being proactive, risk addressing function that can deliver business\nvalue. And what we just discussed being a business enabler. So I think\nthat\u0026rsquo;s very important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 55:28\nBut I would say one of the very important points coming from this is\nactually spending that time to understand what is that the executives\nactually think, as Marius rightly mentioned, what actually keeps them up,\nwhat is that they\u0026rsquo;re thinking about what\u0026rsquo;s of importance to them as it\nrelates to an organization overall productivity. So, yeah, those are the key\npoints that I think I have actually gained from skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 56:04\nBrilliant. I think that\u0026rsquo;s pretty much it. Thank you, guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 56:07\nThank you so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2023/mini-summits/Oct/Governance/","event":"mini-summit","expirydate":-62135596800,"facebook":null,"fuzzywordcount":9e3,"hey_summit":"https://www.linkedin.com/events/7114365329249624064/","image":null,"job_title":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752075784,"layout":"","linkedin":null,"notes":null,"objectID":"ad5ab28de66e0645b7637effed4e613d","organizers":["Danny Lopez","Richea Perry","Chen Gour-Arie","Marius Poskus","Guy Marong","Maciej Owsiany"],"permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/governance/risk-communication-bridgin-the-gap-between-risk-professionals-and-executives/","project":"Risk and Governance","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":43,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/governance/risk-communication-bridgin-the-gap-between-risk-professionals-and-executives/","section":"sessions","status":null,"summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-session\"\u003eAbout this session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis topic explores the challenges and strategies for effective risk communication between risk professionals and organizational executives.

In April 2023, we\u0026rsquo;re\ngoing to be talking about risk in the monetary space. We got some high\nsuper experienced hyper knowledge panelists here. Maybe Isaac give a\nquick intro and Marius and then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nHi, guys. My name is Marius vice president of cybersecurity for global\nfinancial services. Yeah, been around Cyber for a little while. Heavily\ninvolved in building risk treatment plans in modern tech space. Hopefully\nwe have an interesting conversation with the guys this evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nMe, I\u0026rsquo;m a senior staff engineer at Datadog and focusing on the security\nproducts over there. Lately for the last ten or so years been discussing this\nrisk thing quite a lot, both from the side of the customer, like figuring out\nwhat is risk, and from the side of the producer saying, how are you going\nto explain risk to other people? As we can see, Dennis was in the middle of\na very risky operation, trying to go from one place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nTo another in the rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nI\u0026rsquo;m cycling through Central London. It\u0026rsquo;s less risky these days. Man they\u0026rsquo;re\ncycling now. It\u0026rsquo;s very civilized. When I was the risk analysis 15 years ago\nwas way worse than now, right? For me, risk, I think I had a number of\nepiphanies on risk, I guess, in my journey, especially once I can start to\nvisualize and think of risk as graphs and then maps. I guess one of the\nreasons me and these already had several of worldly map sessions, right?\nMarius do you want to take that one first? When I realized that you can\nthink of it also has maps, you have a huge amount of context. I feel like\nfor me, the big interest here is how do you make this scale? Which is also\nwhy I think things like GPT, like technologies are probably one of the\nmissing pieces of the puzzle because it allows us to process data and\nmaybe tree maps if you want it like that in a much more scalable and\npragmatic way, but also in a way to customize the message to the\naudience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nWhy don\u0026rsquo;t we kind of start there, right, like in terms of how to capture risk\nand then present it so that the audience understands the risk that they\u0026rsquo;re\ntaking and makes good risk decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nMyers do you want to take that one first?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nYeah, well, I think the problem normally I think we face because if we\nstart talking about qualitative risk management, it normally starts with\nsomewhere finger in the wind, because normally you do a three x three\nfive x five matrix. You have to start some ways, and then once you develop\nenough of the risks and enough of the framework around it, then you can\ngauge in between how we define what\u0026rsquo;s risky and what\u0026rsquo;s not. I guess we\ndefine what do we care about by qualitative risk management and then we\ndefine by quantitative risk management whether it\u0026rsquo;s worth doing or not.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s normally I see organizations kind of marry those two. The problem\nis, I think nowadays and I see a lot, actually the last few posts that I\u0026rsquo;ve\nbeen talking with some professionals in this space. The problem is how do\nyou report risk further up the chain and how do you get buy in?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nBecause the problem is normally I see some security professionals, they\nreport things like vulnerabilities, found incidents because they can\u0026rsquo;t define\nhow to report risks and how to put it in tangent numbers so the board will\nunderstand. That\u0026rsquo;s when I think that normally the problems arise. I don\u0026rsquo;t\nknow what your experience with eyes are, but that\u0026rsquo;s where I see the big\nproblems normally happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nI agree with you completely and it\u0026rsquo;s interesting that immediately you took\nthe risk to the board and I agree that\u0026rsquo;s usually where we see this thing\nexpressed. Those are the people who apparently are the most interested in\nrisk, at least in the quantitative side of risk. Actually you just popped that\nin my head. If we take it to the other side, to the developer, they are more\ninterested in the qualitative side of risk, right? That\u0026rsquo;s where I think that\nthe notion of risk becomes more important than the definition of risk. I\nmean, the formal definition that I have always been taught is that risk\nequals probability times impact. Impact is usually dollars, right?\nProbability is whatever between zero and one. So risk in that equation\nbecomes dollars. One thing that I have noticed is that come to a developer\nand talk to them about risk in terms of dollars, they\u0026rsquo;re not really\ninterested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nThey\u0026rsquo;re interested to know is this bad, is this good? You pop into info low,\nmedium, high, critical. Right! That\u0026rsquo;s when you fall back into the\nprobability times impact. Well, there\u0026rsquo;s a probability of X that this impact is\ngoing to happen. The next question that they ask you is why? That\u0026rsquo;s where\npeople start moving their hands very fast in the air because basically\nnobody knows the probability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t know what the probability of attack is. It depends on so many\nthings and so many things that we absolutely have no control over. Denise,\nyou were going to say something, you garbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nI think he\u0026rsquo;s gone, so I\u0026rsquo;m going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nTo go to my ramp. We are losing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nI can hear you guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nThe winds of London are stronger than you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nAll right. I was just moving around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nOh, that\u0026rsquo;s better? Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nIs that better? Yeah. Yes. No. Cool. Yeah. What I was saying is that I think\nyou jumped massively right there, right? Because yes. There\u0026rsquo;s a number of\nrisks that I think it\u0026rsquo;s hard to measure the probability. Right, fair enough.\nRight. I would argue that these days you have lots of data, right? There\u0026rsquo;s\nlots of data that you can start to make some very good fact based analysis\non your environment, on the company that you work for. You have, man.\nWhatever company you work for has a history of incidents, right? Well,\nyou should have okay, if you\u0026rsquo;re telling me that I just arrived at a company\nthey haven\u0026rsquo;t, then be doing cybersecurity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nNo. Even if they have, what does that tell me about the future?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nNot necessarily. If you give me a mapping on what are your threat agents,\nright? What kind of attacks you see, what attack surface you have, what is\nthe business model of the attackers. I can already tell you to a certain\ndegree the kind of vulnerabilities, the kind of exploits you will have. Right.\nLike what kind of monitoring you have in place, what kind of impact you\nhave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nYou are asking for a huge job of threat intelligence to come back at the\nsame list of vulnerabilities that we keep going back to all the time. So just\nfix those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nNo, because you need context, right? Because the vulnerabilities depends\non context. A vulnerability is just in fact, a lot of businesses have\nvulnerabilities by design, right. Like their business model is a f******\nvulnerability. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say that your company had an ATO incident. Does that mean that the\nnext thing that you\u0026rsquo;re going to have is an ATO incident? No, it means that\nATO incidents happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nSure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t know if the chance of the next one is 65% 95%. It will happen at\nsome point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nNo, it matters. Right? Because it depends how the ATO going there. Right.\nFor example, I think in risk we have to have a level of objectivity here.\nRight. It\u0026rsquo;s like, I found that if I don\u0026rsquo;t have a data to support a point, let\u0026rsquo;s\nsay, for example, inside the threat, right? You say that inside a threat is a\nproblem, let\u0026rsquo;s say. Right, but I would argue in some companies there\u0026rsquo;s no\nevidence of insider threat. Also, if there was an inside malicious insider,\nthe amount of damage they could do is massive. Right. That company\ncurrent business model is based on them not having malicious insiders.\nNow, that\u0026rsquo;s an important distinction because you need to focus on what is\ntheir real threats. Right? Because when you go and say, and this is why I\nlike that risk, quantifying the risk. Right. If you have a Pragmatic\nconversation with boards and with execs, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nYou need to be able to say, this is the things that we worry about. These\nare things that we\u0026rsquo;re not worried about. These are things that we cannot\ndo anything about unless you double our budget because we just don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave the capacity. And that\u0026rsquo;s a risk based conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nI guess that my point. That at some point you stop talking about risk and\nyou start talking about priorities. Priorities are much easier to explain\nthan risk. The language of risk at some point connects itself to the\nlanguage of insurance. Right. That there is enough data out there to say\nthat a male of a certain age, of a certain background has X chances of\nhaving a heart attack by I don\u0026rsquo;t know when there is enough data for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nPriority without risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nOn the other hand, for risk, for our risk, a lot of what you see is casino\nmat. It\u0026rsquo;s people like Brooke famously says, it\u0026rsquo;s casino math. You see\npeople like just throwing coins in the air and saying, dude, the chances of\nan attack happening is X. Even having the data that you mentioned, the\ncontext that you mentioned, which is very important, I agree with you. You\nstill don\u0026rsquo;t come out with data that should be considered totally actionable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nLet\u0026rsquo;s explore that concept of how can you set priorities without having a\ngood level of risk. Let me just define this. I like to think of risk as a series\nof whys, right? Is the five whys. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like it\u0026rsquo;s a graph, right? You\nstart with a vulnerability. In fact, a vulnerability is a fact that has security\nimplications. Right. I want to say a fact is that server unpatched. That\u0026rsquo;s a\nfact. Right. I could say, well, that server is unpatched with this type of\nthing that has a security vulnerability on it. Cool. Now you ask why does\nthat matter? Right. You keep asking why until you hit some very top level\nitems. Right? It could be that it matters because it holds highly\nconfidential data. Well, yeah. Then that matters. Right? It matters because\nit\u0026rsquo;s connected to the Internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nYou see, it\u0026rsquo;s what I said about the developer. You went into five wise. I said\nthe developer is going to two. So having those five is great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nThe five wise is how you go to the top and every five, every answer to a Y\nis almost at a management layer, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nThat\u0026rsquo;s great. If at some point you don\u0026rsquo;t come and say the probability is X\nbecause you will never be able to support that X. That\u0026rsquo;s my whole point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nWhere you can define probability these days when you\u0026rsquo;re hitting places\nwhere the probability is really low, probably needs to be this is with more\nor less risk appetite. Fair enough. In a lot of organizations, I would argue\nthat if you cannot make a valid logical reason why that\u0026rsquo;s a f******\nproblem, right? Then the job, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nThere you go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nYou should be able to right? Because you should say, look, you have a\nfreaking server connected to the Internet with a loan vulnerability. There\u0026rsquo;s\nnone exploits. Five companies got exploited over there. There\u0026rsquo;s a high\npossibility that you\u0026rsquo;re going to be hacked next, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nVersus, wait, I want to hear my view because he comes from an executive\npoint of view rather than the logic of the things that chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nMayus yeah, well, I always have a view because we\u0026rsquo;ve been talking a lot\nabout risk in terms of actors and attacks. There\u0026rsquo;s a much wider enterprise\nrisk that I consider when I start talking, because we start talking about\nbusiness continuity, planning, disaster recovery, we talk about obviously\nthreat actors. There\u0026rsquo;s loads of other things that come into talking about\nbusiness impact analysis and critical systems that not necessarily talking\nonly about patches, but talking about business continuity of operations.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the key, I think. Especially nowadays, I work in the fintech space in\nkind of new they don\u0026rsquo;t have legacy systems. I\u0026rsquo;m a big proponent as well\nwhen we start talking about risk, because normally, even my post today, I\nthink I\u0026rsquo;m a big proponent about creating a narrative. When you go to the\nboard, you need to know who you\u0026rsquo;re talking to, you need to know the\nlanguage you need to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nSecurity normally is always viewed as a cost center. How do you change\nthe narrative from becoming not only cost center, but becoming\npotentially a money saving person, and secondly, becoming creating a\nsecurity solution programs and strategies to gain competitive advantage\nagainst companies that you might be competing for tenders or competing\nin the same environment? If you create a narrative, not only talking about\nrisk, but, as Isaiah mentioned, talking about probabilities, but talking\nabout how do we do security to gain competitive advantage? How do we\nembed application security program into DevSecOps lifecycles? To make\nour product the best in class so that every single client that comes and\nputs their customer data with us, they are safe. That becomes much more\nconversation, not only about risk, but about all of these other things. And I\nthink that\u0026rsquo;s normally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nWhat you just done with that is you anchor a lot of, I would say, top level\nrisks that you can use as leverage to put context into the risks at the\nbottom. When you say, how do we get a developer to do X? First of all, the\ndevelopers don\u0026rsquo;t do stuff because they like it or not. They\u0026rsquo;ll do stuff\nbecause on a f****** canban board, right? If it\u0026rsquo;s not a Kanban board,\nthey\u0026rsquo;re not going to do it. The developer is not even the most important\nperson to do is the PM is whoever owns a Kanban board. They\u0026rsquo;re the ones\nwho need to take responsibility. I like what marriage you\u0026rsquo;re talking about\nhas also taken into account the business continuity, like the business\nelements, right? The business practice, the business properties, because\nthat\u0026rsquo;s where it matters, right? You could argue that, for example, if I\nchange this in security, I\u0026rsquo;m now reducing the risk of business continuity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a very valid reason to do it. That has a lot of strength, right?\nBecause it means that we\u0026rsquo;re going to make these changes to some part of\nthe business, but we\u0026rsquo;re going to improve not just the risk of data loss or\nthe risk of financial, but we\u0026rsquo;re going to improve the risk of, for example,\ndisruption or lack of business continuity. And that\u0026rsquo;s what I mean. The five.\nWhys? Because when you follow the risk, you arrive at those at the top.\nThe key is to make sure that you have contact. That\u0026rsquo;s the problem that\nmost people have. The problem that we have is that we don\u0026rsquo;t easily\nconnect this action on the ground, which is reality, make this change,\npatch this, fix this, make whatever to almost what is the business impact\nactually positive or negative in the business? Right?! We need to be\nfollowing this in a data driven way and knowing something is data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nRight? Like, I could say I have no visibility on what the h*** happened\nover there, so you have to accept the risk of debt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nThat to me, translates into the priority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nBecause as Mari said, the narrative is important, but the narrative is\nimportant both at the board level and at the developer level. I agree with\nyou, developers who want to do what\u0026rsquo;s on the Campbell board. The place\nwhere we come and unfortunately, the narrative that we\u0026rsquo;ve been using for\na long time is selling insurance. We say you do the same or terrible things\nare going to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nThe thing is, I just wanted to add this. We\u0026rsquo;re talking about developers. I\u0026rsquo;ve\nbeen posting and talking a lot about developers and addressing potential\nrisks and, and building devs across frameworks. I think the problems\nnormally the people struggle. That because A, developers don\u0026rsquo;t hate KPIs\nin terms of looking at security, and B, normally to build an appsack\nprogram, you need to build security into development culture. That can\u0026rsquo;t\nhappen in three, six, or even twelve months. Sometimes. It\u0026rsquo;s a big job to\nteach developers to do threat modeling to them understand the risk, and\nit\u0026rsquo;s not easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nTo Dennis point, yes, they will only do what\u0026rsquo;s in the Camban board. The\nquestion here is not what\u0026rsquo;s in the Camban board is how do we get our\nstuff in there? And that\u0026rsquo;s true priorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nYou use risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nThe thing that you\u0026rsquo;re proposing is more important than that next feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nYes. And you use risk ownership for that. The trick that we now start to\nuse, and then it works really well, is that every risk needs to be accepted.\nThe only variable is for how long? Right? The key here is to make the right\nperson and the right organization chart accept the risk. Because what\nhappens in most organizations, the security team is actually accepting a\nlot of risks on behalf of the business. The way I look at this is that let\u0026rsquo;s say\nthat I represent security team is that you represent the engineering\nfunction and Mario, you represent the business function. Right. The way it\nworks is Marius comes along and says, we need to do X, right, for this\nbusiness objective, right. Either you come and you map a plan, you hire a\nteam, you\u0026rsquo;re implementing it, security comes along, go, hey guys, there\u0026rsquo;s\nsome side effects of security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nWe have to do this XYZ, right? The key here is to give the risk and the\nwhys of those risks, why is there a problem? Because this increases the\nexposure of this exposure of that compromises, these bricks compliance\nXYZ, and it\u0026rsquo;s Marios who needs to accept the risk. Now in this example,\nMario, as a business owner, your only option is you want to accept the risk\nfor a day, for a week, for a month, for six months. Because what that\nmeans is that Delta is how long you expect it to be done, right? If you say,\noh, I\u0026rsquo;m not happy to accept this for more than two weeks, for example,\nyou can only do that if you already have an item in the backlog, right?\nBecause if that was on the backlog, there\u0026rsquo;s no way it\u0026rsquo;s going to be done in\ntwo weeks. Even if you, from a business point of view, say, yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s\nquite harry, I\u0026rsquo;m not comfortable with those risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nWe can challenge you to say, yeah, but if you don\u0026rsquo;t allocate resources in\nIsa\u0026rsquo;s team, which represents the engineering team, then you\u0026rsquo;re going to\nhave to accept it for three months or six months or a month, because until\nyou allocate resources, that risk will still be there. That completely\nchanges because the problem I always have with risk is we don\u0026rsquo;t make the\nright people accountable for the decisions that they\u0026rsquo;re making. Every time\nyou make somebody click on something, even adding an emoji to answer\nor replying to an email, they know that we are making them accountable\nbecause we\u0026rsquo;re creating a digital trail. That, I think, is the key, is to create\na digital trail with a business owner for the risks that they\u0026rsquo;re buying, so\nthey become accountable when those risks materialize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nFirst of all, I\u0026rsquo;m going to tell you I\u0026rsquo;m a huge fan of personal accountability.\nI love your approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nRole with accountability, right? Role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nYeah, let\u0026rsquo;s say role. My problem is exactly with that we live in a reality\nright now that people rotate very fast between jobs. Somebody in that role\naccepted that risk. The next guy is going to come in, the first thing that he\nreceives is a bomb on his head of all the risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nAbsolutely. Yeah, exactly. That\u0026rsquo;s exactly how it should be. Right. But today\nwhat happens is the worst. Today what happens is a new person comes\nalong and they have no idea what this is inherited. By the way, the other\nkey element here is that when you give risk to an individual, you\u0026rsquo;re not\ngiving the risk to that individual or that role, you\u0026rsquo;re giving it to the whole\nfood chain. That means that you accept the risk on behalf of your\nmanager, on behalf of their manager. So the risk follow upwards, right?\nAlso we have also the power because we get to choose who ultimately is\nthe ultimate arbitrator of risk, right? Because we could say, hey, you need\nto accept this, but your boss needs to underwrite it because actually this\nhas bigger implications. What we\u0026rsquo;re doing is we\u0026rsquo;re making the people\naccountable at the right level of the organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nIn your example, when the person leaves, guess what, their boss has all\ntheir risks and ultimately ends up on the CEO or the board because all\nrisks have to go upwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nComes the question, are we creating a bit of institutional paralysis in\nhere? Because you\u0026rsquo;re going to start a dialogue that goes up and down the\nchain all the time. Do we accept this risk? Do we accept that risk? He\naccepted that one, but his manager won\u0026rsquo;t. Now they have to have a\ndiscussion between them to see who accepts what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nThat\u0026rsquo;s great. Today is the worst. You get that and officially with no\naccountability, with people not paying attention because they know there\u0026rsquo;s\nno accountability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nI want to add a couple of things. I think in modern organizations, what we\ntry and do nowadays, you can preempt some of these things. So we started\nbuilding Security Champions Network. One thing to preempt the risks and\nget visibility in various departments, but secondly, now organizations, and\nI\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of It, doing Cybersecurity Council. Normally before you take\nthings to the board, you have a council that is built up of management\nteam that has already pre approved your ideas and your solutions for risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nExactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nAnd for everything else. Before it goes to the board, you already have a\nbig support behind your back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s key, right? The way this scales is that when you accept risks,\nyou\u0026rsquo;re also accepting that level of risk across a particular so in a way, you\ncreated authority, in a way correctly, actually accelerates the business\nbecause you now know what risks you\u0026rsquo;re willing to accept versus what\nrisks you\u0026rsquo;re not willing to accept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nYeah, it\u0026rsquo;s probably similar as to thinking about AA language model. You\nbuild a model because sometimes organizations, especially when you come\nin and new, it\u0026rsquo;s very hard to have a conversation of what\u0026rsquo;s your risk\nappetite because it goes up and down. Especially it depends which\ndepartment you\u0026rsquo;re talking because obviously innovation and developers,\nthey\u0026rsquo;re always going to be more risk takers because they\u0026rsquo;re all absolutely\ngoing to innovate. Whereas someone who\u0026rsquo;s dealing with 2008 servers in It,\nwho\u0026rsquo;s just daily standing one stick, they\u0026rsquo;re not going to be as risk averse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nYeah, and what you want is make sure that, for example, your startup\nmodel does not have access to all the assets of the organization. I think\nthat\u0026rsquo;s why risk is interesting, because you can go, hey, you guys want to go\n100 miles an hour. You want to have these shortcuts, which I get it from a\ndeveloper point of view, but you now, for example, need to accept the risk\nthat you have access to all our customer data. Immediately, if you say that,\nthey\u0026rsquo;re going to go, whoa, I don\u0026rsquo;t want that risk, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have that\nresponsibility. Okay, fine, then let\u0026rsquo;s limit that. Until you give them that risk,\nthey don\u0026rsquo;t understand it, right? Even, for example, like GDPR, I had some\nreally cool cases where companies want to capture a lot of this data,\nright? We basically said, okay, but if you capture all this data, you\u0026rsquo;re going\nto have to accept all these GDPR risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nYou\u0026rsquo;re going to have to accept all these things and all these requirements\nthat you now need to do, even something as simple as erasure data.\nErasure, right. When we gave them those risks, they start asking the\nquestion, why are we capturing this data? Why do we need it? Do we\nactually need this particular data for our business case? And they didn\u0026rsquo;t.\nRight. It was giving them the risk was a much more business friendly way\nto say, look, we\u0026rsquo;re not going to stay in front of what you want to do as a\nbusiness, but you need to be able to take accountability for the risk that\nyou\u0026rsquo;re buying, for the business, for what you\u0026rsquo;re doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nThat becomes a key sometimes even becomes people, I think struggle with\nit becomes a key skill. How do you follow this trend? How do you ask\nspecific questions to get to the bottom of the truth? Because sometimes\npeople just get frustrated, oh, I can never get done with this and that, or\nwe can never do it. You get to the bottom of the root cause of why\nsomething is happening, why there is a risk, why somebody has to accept\nthe risk, why there is because people sometimes forget, yes, data is king.\nData collection comes with so many responsibilities, and it\u0026rsquo;s normally so\nmany regulations. Especially, it always says you only collect the data that\nyou need for your business operations, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t, that becomes very\ntricky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nYou can use risk to drive that. Yeah, imagine he\u0026rsquo;s doing a thread model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nAnd we lost him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nActually, I agree with everything that you guys are saying, but it\u0026rsquo;s just that\nall of a sudden risk is getting this huge profile, and all of a sudden you\nneed this huge operation around risk to identify, to justify, to manage.\nDennis, we completely lost you for the last 30 seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nI can hear you guys. It\u0026rsquo;s really weird. I can hear you guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nNo, continue where you were. You are going to an interesting place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nGo. Yeah, look, I think the idea is that you need to make for that to scale,\nyou have to actually going just to the point you were saying this doesn\u0026rsquo;t\nwork if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t scale. Right. That\u0026rsquo;s why I like the whole GPT stuff and\nit\u0026rsquo;s the chat GPT stuff. The next generation where you can feed it lots of\ndata is the first time that I can see this can really scale because it can\nscale from the point of view of imagine feeding it all the GDPR. Feeding it.\nAll of us, 27,000 feeding it. Also AWS best practices plus ASVs from OAS\nplus maturity model and say. Okay, now, here\u0026rsquo;s my data. Now what\u0026rsquo;s my\npriorities? Or how do I put context into this particular risk that I have\nhere? Right? More importantly, how do I then translate it to the multiple\naudiences that I need to communicate it to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nOkay, that first part there, I\u0026rsquo;m allergic to the idea how to communicate.\nI\u0026rsquo;m totally for. To let that kind of model make decisions for me at this\npoint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nIn the technology I didn\u0026rsquo;t say make decisions, I say give me contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nI think loads of things. Depends how you build your enterprise risk\nmanagement framework. Because, for example, I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan that we have\na risk co, but we only talk about risk, about the top things. I have a cyber\nrisk register which houses however many risks. The ones that go to Risco\nis the ones that within the context, within now and today we need to\naddress. The thing is, the key point is it\u0026rsquo;s always changing. Things are\nhappening, risk grows up and down. The one key thing as well, sometimes\nI want to mention that I think sometimes people really forget. You\nmentioned Dennis about accepting risk. Yeah, accepting risk or accepting\nrisk with an end date in mind. But there\u0026rsquo;s another thing. Sometimes\npeople, when they reach a risk that goes to an acceptable level, they close\nit. You never close the risk because no, you accept it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nSomething you added and the risk profile changed completely and now it\nbecame from low risk, became medium, and then all of a sudden, another\nmonth later became a high risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nYeah, but that\u0026rsquo;s why you don\u0026rsquo;t close it. You accept it. It\u0026rsquo;s very different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t close it. You accept it, and that\u0026rsquo;s very different. I\u0026rsquo;m stuck on\nthat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nWell, closing a risk implies it\u0026rsquo;s done, right? Implies that we got rid of it.\nRight? I would say close is close to eliminate because you can eliminate\nsome risks, right. Or put this right. You can bring it to the level where\nthey\u0026rsquo;re not statistically significant. Right. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to care about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nAccepting is saying, I can live with it and it\u0026rsquo;s under my risk appetite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nExactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m not going to fix it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nYes, but I\u0026rsquo;m taking responsibility for it. Because that\u0026rsquo;s what the business\ndoes every day. Every business executive every day makes business\nacceptance decisions. I invest here, I invest there, I live with this, I\u0026rsquo;m roll\nthe dice here. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that will happen. All those are risks, but what\nthey\u0026rsquo;re doing is they\u0026rsquo;re accepting the risk. What we\u0026rsquo;re doing here is\nformalizing that, but we\u0026rsquo;re formalizing so that they\u0026rsquo;re accountable. What\nteach you about this is notice how so many business risk decisions are\nmade in meetings. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s like you will say, XYZ, and somebody\nvery senior goes, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I agree with that. That\u0026rsquo;s a risk decision. At\nthat moment in time, they just said, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do this. What you need\nto give them is that little piece of paper going, Cool, then go on a record,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nYeah, we did that before as well. What we do sometimes as well, we\nunderpin, for example, a cybersecurity program based on level of threat.\nSophistication so we say, for example, me, as a company, I say, I can\u0026rsquo;t\ninvest enough money to prevent state sponsored threat actors so we can\nwork up to the level of cybercrime, but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to try and invest\nmillions and millions to prevent from state sponsored threat actors\nbecause it will just not be financially viable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nOr you haven\u0026rsquo;t hit them, right? Or you haven\u0026rsquo;t got to the point where\nyou\u0026rsquo;ve been compromised by a state actor and the board asking you\nprotect us from them, right? But you\u0026rsquo;d be a very different company. Think\nabout what you just there was. You create a risk decision. The risk\ndecision is that we\u0026rsquo;re not going to protect ourselves against state\nsponsored actors with this kind of sophistication but that\u0026rsquo;s the risk\ndecision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nYeah, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when I would say, well, you can do it for six months, for a year,\nbecause in principally, it\u0026rsquo;s not going to change, but you can keep going\ndown, right? You can then say, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to protect myself against\nhighly sophisticated actors. Or, for example, you can say, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to\nprotect ourselves against activists because we have a great brand, because\nour brand does not have activists hitting it, and because I have no\nevidence at the moment of being hit by activists, right. Or the other round,\nright? I\u0026rsquo;m not going to protect ourselves against commercially driven\nactors because it\u0026rsquo;s really hard to make money with our digital access, but\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to protect ourselves against activists because we kept f******\nbeing hit all the time by that. But those are risk decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nDennis I feel like I have to throw a bit of a bucket of cold water in this\nbecause you\u0026rsquo;re describing this amazing framework where you have access\nto all kinds of intelligence and understanding and you have these people\nsitting up in the top saying, we will need to accept this and this is our\ntractor. Meanwhile, I have a developer that I can\u0026rsquo;t even stop doing an\nSQLi. Okay? We\u0026rsquo;re building the whole risk treatment factory here, while\nat the ground level, we are not getting the most basic risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nKilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nWe had ten years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nNo, but then yes and no. Right, okay, start with that guy. Right, okay. You\nhave a developer creating SQL injection. All right? Does it matter what\u0026rsquo;s\nthe implications of that SQL injection?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nYeah, there\u0026rsquo;s a few things obviously yeah, you have to answer, right? What\nkind of data is he working exactly? Is there going to be sensitive data? I\nthink there\u0026rsquo;s two ways you can angle it, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? I always tell people you\nwork top down and bottom up. Bottom up, you obviously find out about\nthe data is working. Does this matter? Secondly, normally when I build an\nappsack program, you have to get development managers on board,\nwhere you have to go to them, you have to build security KPIs. We have to\ntalk because I hate about there\u0026rsquo;s one thing normally that breaks down\nwhen we talk about developers fixing security stuff. We go into their\nworld, we bring our security tools, we go into their platforms, whether\nthey work in Jira, wherever they work, we bring the platforms to the Jira.\nWe create a context, we prioritize, we create risks we can\u0026rsquo;t do from SAS,\noutput 10,000 tickets and try and solve it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nNo, you go to context, you marry that with SAS, Dast and Sea, and you\ncreate a risk narrative. What\u0026rsquo;s the impact of this particular? What data is\ngoing touch? What app is going to work with? You create KPIs with the\npeople that are going to manage those developers, and you work together\nto create a plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the top five things we want them to fix next week? Right? We\nshould be able to give them that, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nLet me close that loop for a second. We started with the divide between\nrisk from the point of view of the board and from the point of view of the\ndeveloper. Now we are bringing that together, saying there is a\nframework, somebody decides the risk appetite, and now the developer\nhas to execute based on that. Where in you guys mind sits the decider of\nwhat is it that the developer will do next based on that risk profile, who is\nthe function, what\u0026rsquo;s the role that actually gets to decide what goes next?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nIt depends how you build. I\u0026rsquo;ve normally done frameworks, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been a\nbig of a fan of what AWS does. I normally build plans similar to what they\ndo. You have a development team, say, of teams are built off six, seven,\neight people, whatever it is. You have a security champion in each\ndevelopment team. There\u0026rsquo;s the person who you gather them all and you\nteach them about risk, about the impact, about the likelihood, and they\nwill become your essentially threat modeling champions. And they will\nidentify the risk. You create they call it a security bar or a level of where\nthe risk is. If that risk exceeds that level, there is an escalation point. So\nyou create AbSec engineers. Normally I will say one engineer per three\ndevelopment teams. So that gets escalated. We do a second round of\nthreat modeling to see if we can reduce that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nThere is a penetration test and a a gateway into release, into production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nTo me, you\u0026rsquo;re describing a near verna situation where in the best of all\nknown words, that would be the that\u0026rsquo;s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nThe framework, you know, getting there. That\u0026rsquo;s why I said to you, getting\nthere is normally that\u0026rsquo;s why I say to people think, oh, we\u0026rsquo;re going to start\ndoing AppSec. Yeah, but normally that framework until it\u0026rsquo;s operational. I\nalways say to people, it\u0026rsquo;s 18 months. Developers, when they haven\u0026rsquo;t done\nsecurity, you can\u0026rsquo;t just say, oh, we\u0026rsquo;re going to start doing security\ntomorrow. It\u0026rsquo;s a cultural shift. It takes effort, it takes training. You create\nsecurity champions. Do you think these people want to be security\nchampions for nothing? You have to create reward programs. Like, we\nsend all of us to something like Black Hat, RSH. There\u0026rsquo;s tangible rewards.\nYou become a security specialist on a team. You hire, obviously, the\nsecured AppSec, security engineers. You bring all the tools. The tooling is\nfine. Fine tuning the tooling and force positives, force negatives. That\ntakes however many months to get to the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nThis all reaches a combination in 18 months. You get somewhere close to\nwhat you say is an Irana no, I love what you\u0026rsquo;re selling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s definitely like paradise sounds like that, but my God, we are\nso far from paradise. How many companies do you know that actually do\nexactly what you\u0026rsquo;re describing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nYou can count on figures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nWhen you finish training those people in those roles, they move. They\u0026rsquo;re\njust gone. So, I mean, we need something that we can use immediately.\nLike somebody just came in, got on board. It, dude, this is risk for us here.\nThese are priorities. This is what you do, this is what you don\u0026rsquo;t. We don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave time to build that huge runway to get to the desired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s where we are heading that way because we starting to bring\nsecurity tools into development. IDE. We start in going away from going\nto the boards and stuff like that. Nowadays, developer types code, and in\nIDE, it gets straight away pointers to raise. And now they\u0026rsquo;re even adding\nrisk. You\u0026rsquo;re just quantifying and creating some framework of what needs\nfixing now versus you can push into production and we accept the risk.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a timeline for the fix. You just probably quantify critical high, we\nfix now and then medium lows, you have a time limit. You built in SLAs\nand it can go into production because then you prevent from them\ninnovate. You\u0026rsquo;re not preventing them from innovating but at the same time\nyou\u0026rsquo;re keeping security in terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nIs this the time when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nWe I just wanted to add a comment on when you said about who owns the\nrisk. I think yes. The closer you can be to the technology teams and the\nengineering teams, the better. Right. I have to say that these days there\u0026rsquo;s a\nmuch bigger realization by engineering that they need to be secure. Right.\nI think Al.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nI feel like these are the best parts of what he has to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nI think he just presses something like I\u0026rsquo;ve got great idea. Let me press a\nbutton to freeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nThere\u0026rsquo;s probably an app for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nMust be something in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nI\u0026rsquo;m going on a rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nHere you go. There\u0026rsquo;s no reception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nYeah, I\u0026rsquo;m on a South Bank in London. Can you guys hear me now? I think\nhe\u0026rsquo;s taking the idea of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nMobile way too far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nYeah, I think you need to give it to the business owner. Right. You need to\ngive it to the person who controls the development, the pipeline. Those are\nthe ones who have to own the risk. The key is to make it official. And it\u0026rsquo;s\nnot easy, man. It takes a lot of time and effort, but I think that\u0026rsquo;s the\ndirection of travel is to give them the risks to accept. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nBecause definitely sometimes people even forget to the point we\nmentioned kind of thing you mentioned in the beginning saying security\nowns too many risks. Security shouldn\u0026rsquo;t own even a single risk. Security is\na consultative function to the business that provides you provide ideas\nwhat business to do. If any of the risks are owned by security, then I would\nsay you\u0026rsquo;re doing something wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nTotally agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nYeah. The only risks that we should own are the risks that we need to own\nfrom our own business function outside of security for the security tools,\nfor example, that we push, then we need to own those risks. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nAnd you know what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nAs a business owner, as a business owner, that\u0026rsquo;s the risk we should own,\nnot the business risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nI think that mars you touch on a really important point that we as security\npeople have to make peace with we are not as important as we think. We\nare here for consultancy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nSo we don\u0026rsquo;t have to own risk. We shouldn\u0026rsquo;t. And if we are doing it wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nI agree with the second part, not the first part, but I think we are a very\nimportant part of the fruit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nWe are very important but people forget we\u0026rsquo;re not there to because\nsometimes we create such stories about the risk that might prevent\nbusiness operations. We\u0026rsquo;re not there to stop business operations because\nof risks but now we are there to enable business and make those\noperations just more secure and that\u0026rsquo;s the key point. Sometimes people,\nespecially people in senior cybersecurity positions, they keep saying no.\nThe problem is, the more you say no, the less likely you are to be listened\nto. At some point, you lose the seat by the table and then you get\nfrustrated because you can\u0026rsquo;t do anything because you caused it yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nWell, look, I tell the board and the senior executive says, my job is not to\nprevent incidents, my job is to prevent crisis. Right. Our job is not to make\nthis secure, is to make it safe. And it\u0026rsquo;s a very different proposition. Cool.\nGuys, look, top of the hour. Any final thoughts? This is a great session. We\nneed to do more of these. Love the session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nYou should make a different event. Dinners in the park where you talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nTo people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nPlaying banjo and talking about security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nActually, I\u0026rsquo;m about to go to an event here in London with tons of security\nprofessionals. I should go there and get them on here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nYeah, exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to assist our event. Cool. Any final words, guys?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIzar Tarandach\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a risky business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nIt\u0026rsquo;s risky business. I think the main point will be touching. It\u0026rsquo;s a journey\nand it takes a lot of work to get to a certain level of risk, treatment,\nmaturity. It needs a change of thought, a change of narrative and a\nchange of approach. Yes. I always say to people, there is one key saying\nhere, stop doing the same things if you expect different outcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nExactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what we need to keep. We need some fresh ideas, we need fresh\noutlook of how we address the risk going forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nThe best part, we work in an industry that can still be super passionate\nabout what we do, love what we do and make a difference. Right. Come\non, that\u0026rsquo;s awesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius Poskus\nExactly. It\u0026rsquo;s all about making a difference. I think just a caveat to that, I\nthink the industry itself is probably nothing like anywhere else you would\nmeet, because I\u0026rsquo;ve never met so many individuals that do stuff out of\npassion, serve their time and efforts to help others without any rewards.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been involved loads in mentoring and all kinds of things, and they\u0026rsquo;re\nrewarding. You always say, Just pay it forward. I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen that\nanywhere in such a magnitude as in cybersecurity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiniz Cruz\nI agree. It\u0026rsquo;s a great industry to be part of.

Welcome to this open security summit session in April 2023. We\u0026rsquo;re\ngoing to be talking about security vendors operating model and hopefully\nset up the beginning of a nice, again, community infrastructure for us to\nhave a much more productive relationship with a lot of the vendors and\nreally ratchet up right where the states or where we currently are. So I\u0026rsquo;m\nDenis. I\u0026rsquo;m the chief scientist of Glasswall. I run a lot of stuff in the\nSummit. I\u0026rsquo;m also the CEO of Holland and Barrett, so also been CISO for\nquite a long time. Nick, quick introduction from you. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick Harris:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick Harris, deputy CISO and Head of Cybersecurity here at Holland and\nBarrett. So work very closely with Dennis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, me and Nick work really close together. There\u0026rsquo;s a number of stuff\nthat we kind of have done in the past, and I just want to very quickly walk\nthrough it because I feel that sets the stage. There\u0026rsquo;s a really cool\npresentation that Dan Cutbird has been done recently, I think, with Black\nHat Europe, where he was really talking about the state of the vendors\nand the state of the especially security vendors and how we\u0026rsquo;re really not in\na good place. And I kind of agree with him. Right. I also agree that we\nprobably need a bit more regulation in our industry, but I feel at the\nmoment, like the quality and the service and basically what we get from a\nlot of our vendors is not where we need to be. Given the fact that with the\nnew GPT and the Chat GPT and the evolution of that into the products, a\nlot of the vendors we really need to ratchet up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of the quality, what they provide, the service they do, I really feel\nthat the time is right for the best vendors to actually really come on top\nand we\u0026rsquo;re creating an economic model that really rewards them. There\u0026rsquo;s a\ncouple of two parts in here. One of the elements is that what we really\nneed to see a lot more. This is now a call for a lot of other CSVs, a lot of\nother companies that we need to be working together much closely. Me\nand Ants did a bunch of sessions in the last Summit. This is actually\nstarted in 2008, right? Incredibly. Right. So we did a session in 2022. We\nactually talked about the CDC, and I actually got the slides here. Right.\nThis idea is about creating these collective defense clusters that initially\nstarted in 17 and 2018 in one of the first Summits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncredibly tom flies. Right. We did this session in there and we did a follow\nup, and again, there was some good stuff. Ironically, again, sometimes if\nyou don\u0026rsquo;t put energy, things don\u0026rsquo;t really happen. Right. Me and him\nactually created some really nice documents about basically thinking and\nhow would we set this up. The original idea of the defense cluster was\nalmost the article is it article nine or whatever that article is article five of\nNATO, which is actually this day quite relevant, right? Also that was the\nidea of creating relationships within companies that for example, if one\ngets really attacked, all the other companies will go to the defense. It\u0026rsquo;s\nalmost like try to pull the resources that exist across multiple companies\nand really help each other out. This works really well when you have\ncompanies of reasonable size of maturity. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t work if you have a\nMicrosoft GitHub type of security team with a much smaller company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat works is when you have security teams of certain level of maturity, it\nbasically band together and really leverage that. We put a bit of thinking\nof this and there\u0026rsquo;s almost like this agreement that we can do. The\nimportance again of doing this stuff like this is that you need to make\nsome of these formal agreements within companies. And it was about\nimproving sharing. We talk about some of the confidential data that we\nshare, some of the resources, the pool, the trade intelligence. One of the\nthings we actually end up doing a bit is also vendor knowledge because\nthis already happens unofficially, right? A lot of the systems, a lot of\nsecurity professionals would talk to their friends, their colleagues, their\nmentors and I think we need to really formalize this a lot better, right? We\ncould even have some share funds, share research, share sharing\nresources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was kind of the idea, right, that we could play and there\u0026rsquo;s already\nsome good stuff out there, right? So there\u0026rsquo;s already some good forums.\nThis was kind of the creation of these semi structured groups of\ncompanies that then come together and band together to really leverage\nthis. If you then apply this, for example, to the not just to the response, but\nfor the vendor and make sure that we get the best of the products that we\nhave, one of the things that we\u0026rsquo;re kind of thinking is, and this is something\nI shared with some of the vendors that we have, is that basically what you\nreally want is have this model where we are one team, right? A lot of\nvendors sell a product and then almost like they don\u0026rsquo;t care until they care.\nYou can really see a big difference between the moment of the sale and the\nmoment of the reset of the renewal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle it\u0026rsquo;s they go, well here\u0026rsquo;s the product, you make the mode out\nof it, right? So I think that is very wrong. The other one is that you really\nwant a massive degrees of openness within the system, right? I still don\u0026rsquo;t\nfeel that we have the right level of openness and sharing of information.\nRight? The other one is, again, we want to be a partner, not a client,\nright? That means that we want to give a lot more to the vendors, right?\nWe want to give them much more feedback. We want to have shared\ncommunication platforms. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing how many vendors still don\u0026rsquo;t have\nan easy place to file bugs, file issues. Even something as big simple as to\ncollaborate is not there, right? The other one is that we invest in our\nvendors. We spend the time, we really invest. We really spend the time to\nmake the most out of it and collaborate in the error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, there needs to be a two way street. It\u0026rsquo;s super critical that every\nvendor at any moment in time really shows the value, right, that we need\ninternally, but also that we can use a lot more of the products. This is the\nthing I really like. At any moment in time, we should be either buying more\nor reducing the spend on a product until we reach a state of balance. This\nshould not be a one year or whatever contract. We should be adjusting the\nspend according to what we use. We can go up, but also we can go down\nbecause that\u0026rsquo;s a healthy relationship, right? Which kind of takes us to the\nmodel that, again, companies like AWS already do. I think a lot of the\nindustry needs to move again too, which is we should be paying by usage,\nnot block of licenses. We really should be doing this again, if you\u0026rsquo;re in here\nin the right side of history, if you\u0026rsquo;re not, you might still have clients and\npeople who pay you money, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefinitely your customers are not really going to like a lot of the stuff\nthat\u0026rsquo;s happening, right? We really need for me, it\u0026rsquo;s almost like the key\narea, right? Again, automation and scale creating graphs focus on the\nvalue proposition. To be honest, I would actually now add here, make sure\nthat tools like Chat GPT or GPT, like technology can consume you because\nthat\u0026rsquo;s literally the next evolution. Again, people\u0026rsquo;s personal technology help\nus to make the most out of it. And a worldly map, right? The thing that\nalso I found funny, right? Nick here got a nice taste of worldly maps when\nhe was joining, right? He created really great worldly maps which actually\nhave a session in the Summit. It\u0026rsquo;s like every vendor should give us a\nworldly map to say, where do you add value? Like, what are you\ncommoditizing, what are the things that you\u0026rsquo;re enabling?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are you moving the needs? Even if it\u0026rsquo;s like, oh, we got this custom\nbuild that we\u0026rsquo;re making, it almost as a product. Are we improving this\ntoday or there? Right? They really should be giving that across the board.\nSo Nick, some comments on this, right? I just drop a whole bunch of stuff\nin there, right? Where do you want to start on your views on this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick Harris:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I think it\u0026rsquo;s about disrupting the model. I think there\u0026rsquo;s a momentum\ngrowing that vendors have possibly got quite comfortable that we go\nthrough this onboarding, we give them security assessments, we go\nthrough POVs, we scorecard them, we choose the rest one, the CSM that\nworks with you and you have monthly calls and it\u0026rsquo;s all going well, and\nthen you come back for renewal. Well, I think does that work? Really?\nWe\u0026rsquo;re spending all this money, we\u0026rsquo;re putting all the hard work in. They\nprovided good products, definitely. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of R and D that\u0026rsquo;s gone\ninto the back end. Are they truly working with us as partners to make best\nuse of it? Some vendors better than others, but a lot will be first on your\nback if you\u0026rsquo;ve gone over the license count. There\u0026rsquo;ll be chew ups and true\nups, which is fine, that\u0026rsquo;s the business model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick Harris:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut where\u0026rsquo;s the true down? If we pay for 2000 licenses and we\u0026rsquo;re only\nconsuming 1000 because the adoption hasn\u0026rsquo;t gone well and we need more\ntime with a partner to drive that adoption, where\u0026rsquo;s the true down to say,\nwell, we paid for that, but we\u0026rsquo;re not getting any use from this? I think\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a massive shift that needs to happen in partners getting beyond this\ncustomer Success Manager, the Customer Relationship Manager,\nwhatever they call themselves, and properly partnering that they don\u0026rsquo;t just\ngive you the product at the front door and go over to you tell me how it\u0026rsquo;s\ngoing. They actually drive the adoption and facilitate that. It\u0026rsquo;s not about\nprofessional services and kind of extra stuff. It\u0026rsquo;s just that it\u0026rsquo;s about really\ngetting the best out of the whole platform. Product, service, whatever\nthey\u0026rsquo;re providing, the partnership really needs to link up. Less\ntransactional, more collaborative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agree. Right. I think one of the areas to facilitate that is, I think for a lot\nof companies to start to collaborate because it\u0026rsquo;s easy to do sometimes\nthose moves when you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with one company. If you\u0026rsquo;re now dealing\nwith a band of companies, or a group, or a cluster, or a sector, or a\ngovernment right. Or a set of regulations that defines how you interact\nwith industries, then that\u0026rsquo;s a much stronger proposition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick Harris:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. There are a couple of bits in there. The first one is probably a real\nstretch, but how amazing would this be? Under your CDC concept, it\u0026rsquo;s not\nthe mobile phone provider I have, but there are mobile phone providers\nwhich, if you as the brother, don\u0026rsquo;t use your full contracts, your sister can\nuse it. Why can\u0026rsquo;t if we\u0026rsquo;ve paid for 2000 licenses to use 1000, another\ncompany that we\u0026rsquo;re partnered with can consume the rest and we can then\nnegotiate around that and they can send some others our way where we\u0026rsquo;ve\nmissed. About kind of spreading in an exchange way, some of that\nlicensing and really therefore kind of evening out. Maybe they\u0026rsquo;ve overused\nin one underneath the other. Actually we could benefit with some of that.\nHow can we bitcoin anyway, or transact and pass those licenses around\nwhere they\u0026rsquo;re just not being used?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. No, I like that. Right. Because that\u0026rsquo;s having that value added of a\ncluster of companies, right, that some negotiate well. You could even think\nlike when you have for example, groups of companies, you can have the\nsame structure. If you have even investor groups that they all are on this\nor certain companies who are aligned on specific objectives where they all\ncare about a particular thing, where we once get hit, everybody else\nsuffers. It makes sense to be leveraging this, right, even cross company\narrangements. Like you said, you can have a case where you do an\nagreement that actually addresses multiple companies and then people\ncan use licenses right, in the most effective way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick Harris:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, definitely. That once it is a very good point as well. We talked\nhaven\u0026rsquo;t we, about, I guess peacetime activity, how vendors can work with\nus. Peacetime non article five. We\u0026rsquo;re in NATO and we\u0026rsquo;re kind of getting\nthe best of the tool and driving the right adoption and adoption just\nbeyond the security adoption to the business, whether it\u0026rsquo;s in the Accept\nTeam or DevOps or in HR, whatever it might be. What about when it gets\nto wartime? I think we\u0026rsquo;ve talked about this previously, where are the\nvendors when the incident happens? They need to be pulled in part of the\nincident response team. It\u0026rsquo;s not just that we are using that platform to do\nsome investigation, whatever it might be. Where are they saying, did you\ncould use your platform for this? I\u0026rsquo;m going to bring my engineer in from\nthe vendor and be part of your sponsoring to get the best out of the\nplatform and really drive in on that incident to help us out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick Harris:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we need to sort the professional services out or whatever it is after the\nevent, then we\u0026rsquo;ll do that. But when it\u0026rsquo;s proper crisis, the vendors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeed to be in the room and then have that experience, right, have the\nexperience of how to bring them on board, how to create the\ncommunication channels. At the moment, if you think about it, every\ncompany needs to set that up. Some companies might have done it better\nthan others, right? Every company needs to set up the environment, the\nrelationships, the connections. And again, we don\u0026rsquo;t leverage that. It\u0026rsquo;s\nalmost like you just need somebody in that group to have that relationship.\nSomebody it\u0026rsquo;s almost like in a weird way, again, within a group, we can\neven have certain parts of the group saying well, we are really good at this\nbecause for whatever reason in our world, we have to be really good at\nthis response where maybe another group is really good at DLP, right?\nAnother group is really good at managing cloud assets. Another group is\nreally good at this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, think about being able to leverage that and then being able to bring\nthe vendors in and bring the partners in on peace, but also on incident\nwartime, right, where you get the best out of the shared intelligence and\nthe shared knowledge within those clusters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick Harris:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat exact example can work for the vendor because if the vendors, the\nDLP vendor, let\u0026rsquo;s take that example, working really well with that\ncompany and they\u0026rsquo;re part of the border community, well, that message is\ngoing to translate. The other parts of the community are going to use the\nsame vendor. They\u0026rsquo;re going to take the recommendation they\u0026rsquo;ve probably\nalready been part of some demonstrations or actually sitting with the\nanalysts doing some collaboration and saying, actually just show me how\nthis tool works. And that\u0026rsquo;s going to drive their business. By putting the\ntime and effort in to make their product really work. The business will\nfollow off the back of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbsolutely. There\u0026rsquo;s a business incentive for them to do that. Right. The\nother element is that we now also start to need the security vendors to be\nsecure. Right? Which sounds ironic, but come on, let\u0026rsquo;s be clear. Some of\nthe security vendors, some of them can be the worst ones in security\npractices. As the market is evolving and we now need S bombs for\neverything, we need really good understanding and really good mappings.\nThis is also a nice way to ratchet up the quality of the vendors. I already\nknow stories of some big players who are already putting financial\npenalties on companies who don\u0026rsquo;t provide good information about their\nsecurity, don\u0026rsquo;t do good due diligence, don\u0026rsquo;t really in a way provide that\ngood service or that quality product and then really drive independence\ndown. My comment, I had a panel yesterday, but my comment is like, we\nneed to make a lot of those things public and there needs to be a lot more\nopenness industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think what we can be thinking here is we need to start working on that\nmodel. This is like the worldly maps, right? We know that in the next\ncouple of years the openness will commoditize and it\u0026rsquo;s either going to be\nby regulation, by incidents, or by force or by market momentum. There\u0026rsquo;s\ngoing to be a move from where we are with the crew relationship with the\nproducts and the isolation that you have per client to a lot more openness\nand cluster driven negotiations. We can already operate at that level and\nstart thinking about the logistics of making that happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick Harris:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, you\u0026rsquo;re right. Everyone harps back to Solar Winds being a prime\nexample of where a close vendor has caused big problems. I think in the\nsame manner that with shared intelligence, so to speak, but with sharing\nhappening across the companies about what vendors can work really well,\nthat you see them invest their time and their effort making things work.\nThe sharing of the Glitches and the negative side is also going to be more\nprolific and get around. If the company that you collaborate with, part of\nthe CDC over there has a glitch with a vendor, whether it be their own\nbreach, their own security issue that will come round. Instead of it being\nclosed, shop and the vendor thinking, well, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll lag it until it goes\npublic. Actually, the threat of that knowledge being much more readily\nshared, much more public, should drive their own practices in the first\nplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. And we know that works, right? Because there\u0026rsquo;s already real data\nthat shows that. Cool. Look, I think this is a first step on this, right? I feel\nthat let\u0026rsquo;s plan more sessions at the next summits. Let\u0026rsquo;s start bringing\npeople together. Let\u0026rsquo;s try to make some of these work right, collaborate a\nbit more, use this video, right, to generate some more energy. Right? I\nthink the momentum now is starting to be with, let\u0026rsquo;s create some groups,\nlet\u0026rsquo;s create some clusters. Let\u0026rsquo;s kind of collaborate, and let\u0026rsquo;s find the\nvendors that are working well, the good ones. Right? Because they should\nbe rewarded. Right? The ones who don\u0026rsquo;t have either good products stop,\ninnovating, are not providing a great service. They need to steal the\nmarket economics. Right? It\u0026rsquo;s that simple. We want to create an economic\nmodel that rewards investment in good security practice, in good\nengineering, good customer services, great relationships, and then they\nshould get the financial reward and the business out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick Harris:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m sure if for those that we have that relationship with, we could bring\nthem along to this thing. Equally, people that watch this, if they got great\nvendors that really partner in the way that we talked, bring them along\nand generate that kind of that interest and show how well it can work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. Cool. There you go. There\u0026rsquo;s the challenge. So, unless in any final\ncomments, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if Billy want to throw a couple ideas to the table\nor Nick final comments. Cool. I think all right, then I see you in the next\none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick Harris:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you, everybody.

Welcome to another master\nclass of session. We\u0026rsquo;ll keep it live, we\u0026rsquo;ll keep it interesting and we\u0026rsquo;ve been\ndiscussing a lot about application security, vulnerability management,\ncloud security, on whether to fix something or not to fix. We got in the\nrecent news a lot of example where specific thread feeds were more\ninteresting versus others. So there is a lot of question around what do I\nuse as a North Star to actually fix?\n01:04\nAnd I wish I had a better answer. It depends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e01:08\nBut we will as a silver lining, we will explore all the feeds and cases and\nscenario where this is which feed to use, where just a little bit of\nbackground. I\u0026rsquo;m Francesco Sipolonia, I\u0026rsquo;m the CEO and founder of\nPhoenix Security. We do this day in and day out and analyze and spend a\nlot of time looking at different data analytics.\n01:31\nSpeed and how to make life easier, close bracket.\n01:36\nAnd this is what we called ship smart. So focusing on what really matters\nin the context and scenario where it matters because certain things\nmatters most, certain things matters less in a particular scenario versus\nthe other. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to apologize, or not apologize. Maybe this slide deck\nand this presentation is a little bit lighter on memes. Usually I do an insane\namount of memes, but there is a reason for it. Security, application\nsecurity is really heavy. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s a battle. We are in the trenches,\nfighting to protect our organization day in and day out. And if we don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave a jokes here and there, if we don\u0026rsquo;t have a little bit of banter for my.\n02:19\nBritish folks, it becomes heavy, becomes dramatic.\n02:25\nAnd if we approach this problem with a little bit of a smile, with a little bit\nof banter, then it\u0026rsquo;s a little bit lighter. And that\u0026rsquo;s my mission on this\npresentation.\n02:34\nTo make it interesting, but also lighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e02:38\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been doing vulnerability management at scale in several organization,\nfrom finance to telco to international organization. And I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it, I\u0026rsquo;ve\ndone it all.\n02:48\nAnd I think my mission to actually.\n02:51\nContinue doing this and prioritizing and focusing.\n02:54\nOn what really matters was preventing burnout.\n02:58\nBecause doing things manually, focusing on everything, focusing on the\nlatest superstar vulnerability is not really helping anybody and is burning\nus all.\n03:09\nSo can we scale and make it.\n03:12\nMore enjoyable and available to everybody? The answer is yes.\n03:17\nSo what we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e03:19\nWe\u0026rsquo;Re going to talk about security, development, the human cost of triage,\nthe SDLC approach and what to fix immediately, what not to fix. And then\nwe\u0026rsquo;re going to explore a.\n03:29\nLot of terms that have been going.\n03:32\nAround and I think they need a little bit of contextualization, reachability\ncontext and exploitability. They are not interchangeable and they need a\nlittle bit more knowledge. And also how and where we use this, in which\narea and how complex is to measure and use all of this.\n03:48\nBecause vulnerability management is all about what.\n03:53\nInformation and feed I use, where and how complex is to use. If I spend\nmore time actually measuring and trying to identify the best approach.\n04:02\nTo prioritizing and I don\u0026rsquo;t have time.\n04:06\nTo actually go and fix it, then it\u0026rsquo;s pointless. So which tool do you use,\nwhere and which one, deliver the best ROI or return on investment to us?\nAnd that is where we focus really a lot today. And then of course, all of this\nget captured in the risk. As I say, the risk is the great unifier from the great\ndivide that is vulnerability and this deliver, really we.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e04:29\nWrap up everything into risk.\n04:31\nSo the first time you start a security scanner of any sort across any\norganization, or the first time you enter an organization that hasn\u0026rsquo;t done\nvulnerability management, this is a scenario you are faced with lot of red,\nlot of critical, lot of burning. And the more important question is who\nshould fix what and when? And if you work in a development.\n04:55\nEnvironment well, you have a lot of.\n04:58\nThings to do and then you have the security engineers, the development\nengineers, the cloud engineers, security engineers and so on and so forth,\nthat open tickets for you and very quickly you find yourself in a sea of red\nor backlog.\n05:14\nWhat we don\u0026rsquo;t usually answer is who.\n05:19\nIs in charge of actually doing and continue working on the stuff that keeps\nthe business running, right? Because having a lot of tickets in a backlog\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t mean security. And doing triage and doing triage manually is\nextremely complicated on both sides of the dev divide. So in your dev team\nor in your security team is the same level of challenge of actually triaging\nand identifying what to fix next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e05:48\nAnd doing this all manually is the road of burnout.\n05:51\nBecause traditionally an organization has at least two or three of these\ntools. You have web testing, either open source or non open source. You\nmight have security static analysis, you might have dust autonomic\napplication security testing, a cloud security product, an infrastructure\nproduct. Looking on all of these information is challenging and on top of\nthat you have Pen testing and on top of that you actually have threat\nspeed and the latest vulnerability and the latest panic that happens from\nmanagement, that happens from everyone.\n06:26\nThis is not a right and a.\n06:28\nGood way to go and it\u0026rsquo;s not.\n06:30\nScalable because our attention gets pulled in.\n06:33\nEvery direction and we don\u0026rsquo;t unfortunately have.\n06:35\nInfinite mental resource time and infinite time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e06:40\nAnd this is not news hopefully I\u0026rsquo;m talking and I\u0026rsquo;m preaching to the choir\nbecause this is what we face every day.\n06:48\nAnd if you\u0026rsquo;re a small organization that.\n06:51\nHas less than 1000 employees, hundred devs, you can probably still kind of\nhandle all this manually with different level of expertise. But the surface is\nnot insane. You can still dedicate enough amount of time to each team.\nAnd the more you know each team, the more you know each application,\nthe faster you become in analyzing a vulnerability. And 48 minutes per\nteam per week.\n07:15\nIs actually not that bad numbers.\n07:19\nYou have roughly two or three security teams or one to 50 security to dev.\nProbably not an incentive amount, it\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of work but it\u0026rsquo;s not an\nincentive amount to manage. Probably you will face it when it becomes at\nscale and challenging when you have the superstar vulnerability homes\nlike Log for Shell or Spring for Shell or the OpenSSL and we start seeing\nthose more and more but it\u0026rsquo;s still kind of manageable. Where this becomes\nreally challenging is probably when you get to a mid size to enterprise\nlevel or to larger organization where you have roughly 3000 and more\nemployees you have 1000 devs and much less security team. So if you see\nthe security team do not scale at the same time.\n08:09\nWith the development team and that\u0026rsquo;s one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e08:11\nOf the reason why we keep on saying security is everybody\u0026rsquo;s responsibility\nbecause we don\u0026rsquo;t have enough resource to actually put our hands onto the\nproblem.\n08:20\nAnd if you see here the amount.\n08:22\nOf time it takes us to get through the vulnerability for a specific team is\nmuch less. So we have less time to triage, less time to identify the\nvulnerabilities and we really need to focus on the vulnerability that really\nmatters. So this is where risk management and vulnerability management\nat scale really deliver the best benefit because we get time to.\n08:44\nActually focus on what really matters. And we should remember that the\njob.\n08:50\nOf security is not to fix everything, it\u0026rsquo;s not to fix all the vulnerability.\n08:56\nWe should help the business fix the.\n08:59\nVulnerability that are in line with the risk expectation. So we should just\noperate to the level of risk that the organization is comfortable with. And\nsometimes in security we get kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e09:11\nOf wrap up especially if we\u0026rsquo;re in.\n09:14\nPain testing, especially if we identify a problem. We identify a problem\natomically outside the context of where that problem happens and outside\nthe likelihood of where that problem happens. Can somebody exploit a\nspecific vulnerability?\n09:29\nYes, probably with some level of effort.\n09:32\nAnd some level of expertise.\n09:34\nBut if that vulnerability is buried down.\n09:37\nThe stack and if very little chance that vulnerability is going to get access\nor if that vulnerability is web facing and everybody\u0026rsquo;s looking at that\nvulnerability, those are very two different critical and it might be the same\nlevel of vulnerability, might be the same lockboard j.\n09:52\nThe same critical vulnerability, but in two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e09:55\nDifferent leveling context and with two different level of likelihood. And\nexpressing that to the business, we enable the business to actually make a\ndecision. Do we fix, do we don\u0026rsquo;t fix?\n10:08\nBecause ultimately the only people that will.\n10:11\nAuthorize our dev team to actually go.\n10:13\nAnd work and focus on fixing vulnerability.\n10:17\nThrough the backlog and prioritizing those things through the backlog is\ngoing to be the business. So how do we involve the business into making\nthe right decision? Well, we tend to focus on shift.\n10:29\nLeft and shift right, that is, moving.\n10:32\nThings early in the development cycle or focusing on production.\n10:38\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;ve been focusing as an industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10:40\nA lot in that.\n10:41\nWe hope that DevSecOps and I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\n10:44\nFor using all the terms you can use the security bingo. And trying to\nidentify how many keywords do I hit?\n10:55\nBut we\u0026rsquo;ve been focusing as an industry.\n10:57\nOn these two terms and going left to right and right to left and left to\nright. And security has been kind of in the middle trying to help both\noptions. But the third option and the third kind of key players that we\nforgot was the business. And it\u0026rsquo;s the business that fundamentally set the\nrisk level where we should operate. And that is going to be the only one\nwho is responsible on actually driving the business and fixing\nvulnerabilities. The only one who has the right.\n11:25\nTo say I\u0026rsquo;m going to spend X.\n11:26\nAmount of development time in cycle on that problem versus the other\nproblem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:32\nThe challenge that we have is that.\n11:35\nWe tend to speak vulnerability to executive into the business. We say\n10,000 critical, millions of vulnerabilities.\n11:43\nAnd if you\u0026rsquo;re in any situation like me in the past you get very.\n11:47\nAwkward look, very awkward feeling from management.\n11:51\nTeam where they say what do you.\n11:53\nWant me to do with this? Fix them all, how bad they are. We were\nsurviving with this yesterday. It\u0026rsquo;s not something they can make\nuninformed.\n12:01\nDecision because anybody from a business perspective think in risk and we\nneed to contextualize vulnerability for them and on the.\n12:13\nOpposite side if we go to an engineering process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12:15\nI have a quick comment there. I think you just touched on something\nwhich I found that more and more I think is important is that especially\nwhen you talk to executives, I think it\u0026rsquo;s very important that we have a\ncoherent story, for example, of why it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been exploited. And I think\nbecause it\u0026rsquo;s a bit like imagine you walk into a building and say, hey, this\nwhole has massive gaps.\n12:40\nAnd the people in the building going.\n12:41\nYeah, but the building\u0026rsquo;s been here for 100 years and we haven\u0026rsquo;t had a\nbreach. No, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that you cannot say luck, I think luck is a\nvalid reason or you can say we haven\u0026rsquo;t had attackers who are\nsophisticated enough or we happen to have somebody who\u0026rsquo;d done some\nheroic actions. But I think especially at an executive, I think as you put\ncontext they\u0026rsquo;re going to drive you to have a rational reason for why not in\nsix months from now, why not in twelve months from now, or what\u0026rsquo;s\nchanging in order for this to now be a problem. Which is the kind of\nquestions that the context will drive and I think that makes a lot of\ndifference.\n13:22\nAs you talk to executives and you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e13:25\nGive them kind of the Nostat as you\u0026rsquo;re rightfully saying is the probability.\nYou give a sense of probability, it\u0026rsquo;s not an atomic value. This is not bad\natomically it might be. Lockpoj is a very good example where a\nvulnerability was discovered ages ago that all of a sudden got attacked at\nscale now becomes a really important problem. Another good example is\nmovie transfer. We had this vulnerability exploited eight months for eight\nmonths on a specific attack. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t important before, it\u0026rsquo;s super\nimportant now. Now depending on I brought recently an article on that\ndepending on which.\n14:00\nThread speed you look at, the probability.\n14:03\nAnd the exploit at scale is very low right now on the Movie transfer, but\nthe threat actors that are actually exploiting that are very targeted. So\ndebts in itself require that level of context and a story around that\nvulnerability. Yes, that vulnerability exploitation is very low. But if\nsomebody attacked us with that vulnerability then we\u0026rsquo;re going to face the\nsame level of challenge that we had in Boots, we had with British Airways\nand so on and so forth. So the magnitude that is the second aspect of risk\nis really important and the narrative that you build around the\nvulnerability is really important for the level up. But then we need a\nconnection from level up to level down. Because if we tell that story to\nengineering team engineers, don\u0026rsquo;t bloody cares about all this story, they\njust want to know what do I need to fix in the next print?\n14:52\nAnd if we tell that narrative that\u0026rsquo;s great.\n14:55\nBut ultimately we need to give them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14:58\nA number of story points that they need to allocate in a sprint. And as a\nsecurity team, we sometimes.\n15:03\nForget that\u0026rsquo;s our job to give them.\n15:07\nA visibility on what to do next and the week after and how important it is,\nand then let the business manage at Scrum with existing process. Not\nreinventing the will on new process, but giving them a consistent stream of\nthings to fix that are contextualized and important for the business. Not\nreinventing the will, very boring, but that\u0026rsquo;s what get things done. Not\ntalking about risk, but talking about what needs to be solved next in line\nwith risk expectation and everything else.\n15:36\nYou know, one of the words I found myself using a lot when I talk first of\nmy more technical teams, I say your responsibility if they\u0026rsquo;re on a security\nteam is to produce highly defensible analysis that when somebody with\nknowledge about that really looks at it, they go I get it, I understand. It\u0026rsquo;s\nalmost like you\u0026rsquo;re also forcing us on the security team to actually produce\nreally good materials for.\n16:02\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s a hit and miss, but giving consistent list of things and\ngiving an ability to actually challenge those things and adding context.\n16:11\nAnd having that discussion give much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e16:14\nResult than just flooding a backlog with 2000 tickets. Because that will\nnever get done even ten on a sprint when you have to produce other 15\nfeatures. It\u0026rsquo;s an imbalance approach like one, two, maybe per sprint.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the level of bug fixing that you can foresee and forecast and\nsometimes as a security team we miss that.\n16:37\nAnd maybe we have one, two, three.\n16:42\nShot idea when we have the superstar vulnerability like lockpoj that we all\nfocus on, where we can all hands on deck focus on fixing a specific\nproblem. But we don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of chances like that and they are\nexpensive in the most cycles. So even in those superstar vulnerability,\nfocusing on the one that are more likely to be exploited and forgetting\nabout the other one that can be fixed, maybe even not fixed in a normal\ncycle of fixed versus building and keeping those measurements is really\nimportant. And I\u0026rsquo;m going to stop a specific point with questions so that\nwe\u0026rsquo;ll have time. Otherwise I\u0026rsquo;ll get into rabbit hole with these things.\n17:24\nBut I want to say that on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e17:27\nThe other hand, we tend to oversimplify why security is complex. And\napplication security, I\u0026rsquo;ve talked to it extensively, is complex, is variegated. I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t want to oversimplify with this explanation and with this presentation\nthat it\u0026rsquo;s just risk or it\u0026rsquo;s just a list of things. Context and vulnerability and\nrisk are extremely nuanced and I\u0026rsquo;m going to focus on application security\nspecifically for this case and focusing on the central part of application\nsecurity or an SDLC at a very high level. That is the process of designing,\nbuilding a test and operating. And I\u0026rsquo;m going to even narrow it down to\nbuild and test and operate where a mature SDLC nowadays look like that\nbecause we have a lot of moving component. We have code, we have\ntesting in build, testing in operation. We have things that are being\ndeployed and there are time in place when to fix and when to make\ndecisions.\n18:26\nAnd sometimes making a decision in an IDE in a rapid mode is actually\nmuch more valuable than looking at all the context in the word.\n18:36\nSo there are time in place when.\n18:39\nTo look at contextualization and when to look at fix it now because it is\nvisible and you\u0026rsquo;re going to spend the minimum amount of cycle. Of course\nthere needs to be a balance because we can\u0026rsquo;t fix all the.\n18:49\nVulnerability as soon as they appear, because.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18:52\nMaybe it\u0026rsquo;s a major upgrade of a framework, maybe there is a better way\nto fix a vulnerability. And those are the things that I call fast triage when\nyou decide at IDE points or when you are developing.\n19:05\nSomething, whether to fix a vulnerability or not.\n19:08\nBut then there is the rest and the remaining part of the vulnerability\nbacklog. That is everything else. And as soon as you turn on the\nvulnerability, a vulnerability management solution, you will find a Seal\nvulnerability. So adults vulnerability needs to be prioritized.\n19:23\nAnd they need to be decided.\n19:24\nAnd as well you might find something that operates at development cycle.\nBut a lot of the vulnerability, like log for J, spring for shell, movie transfer.\nAnd things like that happens at operational level. So we need to keep a\nbalance of Prioritized backlog on the right and things that we fix on the\nleft and having a single approach on either one of these will not work\nbecause there are two different speed, methodology and approaches.\n19:52\nAnd as I said, as soon as.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19:54\nYou join the point of vulnerability management is identifying who should\npicks what and what\u0026rsquo;s most urgent and giving them in the backlog in a\nprioritized way. Because flooding a backlog with all the vulnerability in\nthe work will reach to burnout will result in development team not.\n20:13\nListening to security at all and it\u0026rsquo;s.\n20:17\nNot the way to go. Plotting a development team with this is.\n20:24\nThe equivalent of asking the security team to develop features for them\nbecause security.\n20:30\nIs everybody responsibility but what is the responsibility of somebody else\nin terms of developing into delivering feature to the business? So we need\nto empower the business to make the right decision with the.\n20:41\nRight tools at the right time and.\n20:45\nWe are in this situation because Mano Triage doesn\u0026rsquo;t scale as a security\nteam we tend to flood and delegate but it\u0026rsquo;s almost like finding a needle in\nthe haystack. But the haystack is on fire, everything is screaming. And this\nis what normally happen as.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21:00\nSoon as you turn a vulnerability scanner at any point.\n21:03\nAnd the rationale for this is that we are completely unbalanced between\nthe number of security researcher and the number of development. So\nthere will be always an imbalance in this and we\u0026rsquo;ll need to find a way to\nactually scale vulnerability management. But the good news is that not\neverything is.\n21:24\nExploitable in that particular point in time.\n21:28\n10% of the vulnerability accordingly to the latest research is actually\nexploitable, 5% of those are actually reachable and 1% vulnerability are\nthe one that are target.\n21:38\nNow that you should really focus, and.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21:41\nI\u0026rsquo;ll use this term interchangeably here, but actually I\u0026rsquo;ll explore them much\nmore and expand them much more. But just for few statistics, CVSS is\nactually reaching the 20,000 or 200,000 vulnerability, right? Now of which\njust very little percent are actually exploitable and the speed of fixing is\nactually increasing over time. And if we just use SLA. First of all we are\nlate because attacker are actually attacking things faster than we can\nactually exploit because we focus on all the vulnerability an SLA or a\nservice level agreement or how long should we fix and how quickly should\nwe fix things are actually too simple metrics to use and deliver no results\nlike there is. There have been a Ghana, few Ghana studies that have\nidentified that using an SLA based approach doesn\u0026rsquo;t work 100% of the\ntime.\n22:43\nLike it never worked.\n22:46\nAnd the reason why it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work is that the triage is nuanced and you\ncan use different things in an automated versus an automated way. So I\nwant to spend a little.\n23:00\nBit of time on this because I\u0026rsquo;ve.\n23:02\nBeen doing a lot of research on this and I think there have been a lot of\nassumption that triage is straightforward. So I want to break this and I\nwant to break the triage in easy as automatable. We have data source, we\nhave things that we can identify or very hard where things are really hard\nto automate. Hence we rather spend time doing things minor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e23:22\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s a balance.\n23:24\nRight now we overly balance on the right. I want us to be in a balance\nbetween left and right. So let\u0026rsquo;s say bulk. So bulk is the first cut of\nvulnerabilities that we get from different scanner at different points.\n23:37\nAnd I want to say this is.\n23:38\nStuff that we can automate. There are different level of nuances of what\nyou can automate taking different data feed, exploitability active bounties\nvector, reachability in term of code we go from very easy. EPSs is\navailable everywhere, an attack vector is available. CVSS base, if it CWSS\nbase, is there an active bounty? Is there an active exploit? In the wild you\nget threat feed around a specific vulnerability. All of this information are\nmachine readable and can be automated and can be used in an automated\nand scalable way.\n24:18\nTo remove 80% of the vulnerabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e24:22\nNow, the deeper you go in the code with the concept of reachability and\nwe\u0026rsquo;re going touch on the concept of reachability in a moment, the harder\nit becomes to actually track this and do things at scale, it\u0026rsquo;s not impossible.\nBut again, it\u0026rsquo;s a balance between how much effort you put in the\nautomation part versus how much you get out of it. If it takes you hours\nand millions to actually develop a technology or to actually go and scan\neach single line of code and find which single line was fixable versus a\ndecision of ten minutes. Do we fix it? We don\u0026rsquo;t fix it because it\u0026rsquo;s reachable\nwith a team.\n24:59\nDecide where you spend your time, your energy and effort.\n25:03\nThe second complexity of the second screening will be locality. Locality\ngives you the concept of where things are in your environment and how\nlikely are they to get exploited. Again is a nuanced approach. The\nlikelihood derives by the intention of an attacker. But it\u0026rsquo;s a good indicator\nof the more external you are, the more externally facing you are, the more\nlikely things are to be exploited. And you can have those information in\nCMDB. You can have this information in any data set. The lower you go in\nthe stack, the lower you go in this particular stack. Exploitability location,\nreachability, attack paths, you get more nuanced in the location and the\nlikelihood of exploitation of a specific vulnerability and it takes you more\neffort and time. So unless the vulnerability is really sophisticated, it\u0026rsquo;s\nprobably not worth to spend so much money, energy and effort on actually\nan attack vector or an attack path.\n26:06\nAnalysis that delivers you maybe good results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e26:11\nBut you probably have spent enormous amount of time and effort that\ncould have been saved. And second, business criticality and the more we\ngo right, the less automatable information, the less information you have\nto use in a machine readable way. Hence it\u0026rsquo;s harder to get automation.\nHence why I say the left part of this triage and staging of triage is\nautomatable because you have widely available information at scale or\nthere are provided that offer you. But the more right you go, the more this\ninformation depend on your organization, on your particular context and\nnot every.\n26:51\nTime is actually automatable. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be an.\n26:57\nIncentive for you to actually go and automate a lot of this stuff because\nthere is a lot of benefits from it and it\u0026rsquo;s probably not that complicated. But\nfor example, in a business criticality a number from one to ten on.\n27:09\nAn application is easy to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e27:11\nA full fair analysis is probably more complicated to implement and to even\nunderstand. And the last bit that is where really the manual effort comes\ninto place is the business decision is the internal rationale is do we fix this\nparticular bunch of vulnerability or do we upgrade this library, this\nframework? Those decision are really hard to automate and in my opinion\nshouldn\u0026rsquo;t be automated because it\u0026rsquo;s all contextual on the particular\nbusiness initiative that you\u0026rsquo;re having. Do you fix all the operating system\nor do you upgrade to a new operating system? Those could be just\nbusiness reason and decision that are supported by a lot of this\ninformation but is at the decision where actually human are really adding\nvalue versus automation and machine. Because most of the time this\nautomation.\n28:05\nLeads you to a straight path.\n28:08\nJust a quick one I think on your left a good source is also.\n28:12\nIncidents and threat intelligence.\n28:15\nYeah, I think internal incidents especially like for example, one of the\nthings I tend to do is we tend to run sometimes p ones, P three S and P\nfour S and P two S as P ones. And one of the things we get is really good\ndata on either what happened or what was just one degree separation\naway from happening. And that again allows you to prioritize a lot of\nthese because in a way, in fact I would even argue that sometimes we fix a\nlot of things during those incidents. But it\u0026rsquo;s really good data because it\u0026rsquo;s\nalmost like this just happened. It\u0026rsquo;s not like theoretical, it\u0026rsquo;s like the last\nthing of is he ritual. Well it just did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e28:54\nWell, if you get hit by a vulnerability it\u0026rsquo;s like there was a very good second\nWorld War where they analyze and they reinforce the planes where they\ngot hit. So do you reinforce the plane that got hit or do you reinforce\nwhere you didn\u0026rsquo;t see the plane coming back? So it\u0026rsquo;s a little bit unknown\napproach.\n29:15\nI get it, but it depends how you approach it. So for example I would call a\nbigger problem, for example, lack of detectability. So for example, even\nfor someone when a bug bounty tell us something is wrong, I view the fact\nthat we didn\u0026rsquo;t detect it, the fact that we didn\u0026rsquo;t have more visibility, et\ncetera. That\u0026rsquo;s the kind of stuff that again I want to make sure we\nunderstand because actually also detectability is also quite important here\nbecause if it\u0026rsquo;s a vulnerability that you can be quite confident that it can be\ndetected or at least you get some warning signs before it kind of hits\ncritical mass. That\u0026rsquo;s way more dangerous than the kind of vulnerability\nthat although it\u0026rsquo;s a bit more esoteric, if that gets it, then.\n29:56\nIt\u0026rsquo;S a massive problem.\n29:58\nWell, those are things that goes in the triage goes in the human aspect\nversus the automation and it\u0026rsquo;s different on any organization where you\nhave the richness of the data. But in general, doing this manually, all.\n30:11\nOf it manually, it\u0026rsquo;s probably not good.\n30:15\nAnd fixing everything as soon as it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e30:16\nComes out probably not best.\n30:19\nSo thou shalt prioritize or thy trying. That is my rules and that is my law.\nBut I want to say that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot of discussion around reachability.\n30:29\nExploitability in context and all of this.\n30:33\nElement and all of these terms are actually different from each other and\nare very different from each other and they have a different level and\ndegrees of complexity in actually extracting and analyzing and risk can\nexpress a lot of this. That\u0026rsquo;s why I love risk because risk can express a lot\nof this element with a probabilistic factor that the business understand\nwell if we express all of.\n30:56\nThis atomically probably we create a very complicated narrative. But just\nto demystify a lot of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e31:03\nThis term, I want to get to this point where we have a specific library, for\nexample, log for J in a specific file and then that particular library is called\nin a function that is really reachability. That is where a specific library gets\nreachable and that is if I call it then that particular piece of code get\ncalled and that particular vulnerability pops up. Detecting something like\nthis requires a lot a. Lot of effort. We\u0026rsquo;ve seen some security scanner that\nare doing something like this and prioritizing vulnerability with\nreachability it removes the false positive, but again it\u0026rsquo;s a balance between\nhow much cycle and money you need to spend to actually get to that point\nof deciding. Yes, this vulnerability has actually been called by a function\nthat\u0026rsquo;s being called and a lot of those in memory scanner actually can help\na little bit detecting this because really see the attack part or the cold part\nof a specific function.\n32:04\nBut getting to that level is very complicated and require a very granular\napproach across all your code. So this is for me code reachability and\nreachability of a vulnerability is very hard in the stack of automation. It\ndepends on your scanner. But in general from a vulnerability management\nperspective I will classify this as hard network reachability gives you a\nlittle bit more context where you can prioritize maybe a log for J that is\nexternally facing versus a log for J that is internally facing. I would say\nrichability and context give you 50 of complexity depending on how good\nyou have your asset inventory and how good you can create your asset\ninventory.\n32:50\nSo it really depends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e32:53\nExploitability is probably the easiest factors that you can use at scale.\nThere is plenty of information out there is Bond DB, there is EPSs, there\nare plenty of source for you to understand how likely is specific things to\nbe exploitable and use them at scale. I would say use them with a pinch of\nsalt because sometimes some of these information are appropriate\nespecially for application security, sometimes they are not. We\u0026rsquo;ve done a\nrecent study where we screened Caesar Cav that is one good example of\nexploitability backed up because everything that goes in Caesar Cav is\nwell documented to be fixable and to be exploitable. So those are the well\nknown things.\n33:42\nThat are exploited at scale, hit and miss and then we cross reference that.\n33:47\nWith the likelihood of exploitation at scale or the prediction of exploitation\nat scale in the next 30 days that is given by EPSs. A number of\nvulnerability were completely missed, other were exacerbated.\n33:59\nSo use each threat beat in comparison with the other.\n34:06\nSo usually at least two thread beats, not just one anatomically. And the\nother element I wanted to say is Caesar Cav is very good. From a\ntraditional vulnerability management and infrastructure approach and\npatch management versus application security is probably not the best\nresource because only 3% of whatever is in the catalog is related to a\nlibrary or to a piece of code. And there is much more out there that is\nactually highly exploitable. So it\u0026rsquo;s a very stressed list of things that are\nexploitable in the patching and infrastructure world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e34:45\nBut to wrap all of this up.\n34:48\nAnd to conclude fundamentally this discussion is a lot of risk because risk\nis the great unifier. So you can use a lot of this information into a risk\nformula. You can capture the likelihood and the exploitability of\nsomething to get exploited, the severity of something to get exploited, and\nthe criticality. So how much it impacts you into a risk formula that\neverybody can understand and agree on.\n35:14\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s a journey.\n35:15\nRisk is a journey. It\u0026rsquo;s an evolution where you go from pure severity based\nand CVSS CWSS to SLA base to risk.\n35:25\nSo don\u0026rsquo;t adopt.\n35:27\nIt straightforward out of this presentation. I mean, if you want, I\u0026rsquo;d be very\nhappy about it that you go into your organization and we say, scrap\neverything. We should do risk. Yes, we should do risk, but evolve into it.\nAnd a number of regulator, unfortunately, still operate with CVSS and\nCVSS information. But in the civil lining, you can probably add a lot of\njustification if you express your wrist posture and you say I control. My\nwrist posture. Hence, a lot of these CVSS that, in your opinion need to be\nfixed are actually non fixable because I can\u0026rsquo;t reach and they can\u0026rsquo;t be\nexploited at scalar in the world. Usually that conversation goes much\nbetter with an auditor?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e36:10\nIt depends.\n36:11\nFor me, security is not compliance. And the other way around and hate me\nor love me for that.\n36:19\nIt\u0026rsquo;s my opinion.\n36:23\nWe need to evolve. Regulation upscale because we still rely on a lot of stuff\nthat is antiquated.\n36:28\nBut a lot of these factors that.\n36:31\nI discussed today can be used in.\n36:34\nA formula that doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e36:38\nFundamentally, risk in a modern risk could be your CVSS, your CWSS.\nYour severity. You can express the probability of exploitation in a machine\nway, in an automatable way, with exploitability, with threat intelligence. If\nthere is a fix available, where is the particular asset located? A lot of this\ninformation can be extracted and scaled automatically and then you can\nexpress the impact of your business application and how much a\nparticular vulnerability might impact you and how many user and so on.\nSo that can all be expressed in a numerical form. Now you can go as\ncrazy as you want and I\u0026rsquo;m going to slap you with some of the element in.\n37:19\nConsideration of how to prioritize vulnerability and.\n37:24\nWhere to prioritize vulnerability so you can go as crazy as you Want with\nthe Risk Formula. But In A Nutshell, It\u0026rsquo;s Simple and help you Much More\ndiscussing Product rather Than individual Vulnerability. Because Business\nPeople discuss about Product don\u0026rsquo;t discuss about individual Vulnerability.\nAnd if you look at the information between left and right. If you don\u0026rsquo;t\ndiscuss about product, you see just the sea of flat vulnerability. You see a\nnumber of critical and you focus on the number of critical. They\nuncontextualize, they are not focused. On a product prospect.\n38:02\nBut if you add the context, then.\n38:04\nYou can see a lower priority or.\n38:07\nA lower impactful business application versus a.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e38:12\nHigh impactful business application, and you focus on the right versus on\nthe left.\n38:16\nGas billing.\n38:17\nAs soon as you see a lot of red you will focus on the critical vulnerability.\nOn the very long list of vulnerability chances are the one that have\nprobably one or two major critical vulnerability that is externally facing it\nis highly attacked.\n38:31\nAt scale is more likely to get.\n38:34\nAttacked and that discussion helps with the business. So shifting smart is\nall what I say in trying to get the business into this kind of conversation\ncontextualizing. Adding the level of risk and enabling them to set really the\nrisk expectation for where they want to be and translating that concept\ninto where the engineer need to focus. Because if you unify the three\nangles of business dev and ops and security, then you really reach the\nnirvana. What I\u0026rsquo;m talking about that is fundamentally business driving\nrisk security being consulted on risk and developer having a really finite\nlist of things that they need to focus on and this approach has been proven\nto actually reduce the noise, reduce the alert fatigues, increase the\ncollaboration and reduce the burnout from an application security to\nvulnerability management. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying like tomorrow go out and scrub\nyour SLA because okay, SLA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e39:39\nHave worked but they\u0026rsquo;ve been around for.\n39:44\nA while, they\u0026rsquo;re not probably the best tools or if you contextualize the\nSLA.\n39:49\nIf you use specific SLAs around risk probably it\u0026rsquo;s much better and you\ncan.\n39:57\nUse nuance of SLA. And we\u0026rsquo;ve wrote probably tons of article and a couple\nof books around this on how can you evolve from pure CVSS severity\nbased SLA, to multi SLA based on product to risk based SLA and really to\nsecurity OKR? That is where you should aim to evolve your measurement\nbecause those express much better a balance that the team can then\nmanage internally how many things you fix versus how many things you\nbuild that could be an OKR one single security OKR you can put to your\nteam, to your development team and then let them manage how many\nvulnerability they fix. You as a security team should provide always the\nmore likely vulnerability to be.\n40:44\nExploited and get the business on that journey.\n40:48\nAnd if I want to leave you.\n40:49\nWith something is acting risk and not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e40:52\nFixing vulnerability, focusing on really what really matters and this is my\nmission to the world.\n40:59\nSo conclusion today we talked, we fixed.\n41:03\nSecurity, probably not, but at least I.\n41:07\nHope I\u0026rsquo;ve given you some foot for.\n41:09\nToll, some thinking process on what to fix next. Fixing every vulnerability\nshouldn\u0026rsquo;t be done and it\u0026rsquo;s not feasible and it\u0026rsquo;s going to only lead to\nburnout reachability context and exploitability can be used with different\ndegrees and expense in term of engineering power in terms of mental\npower and talking risk and talking probability of exploitation to the\nbusiness is what delivers. I want to give some thanks to the EPSs working\ngroup that has been absolutely fantastic to seek to produce fundamental\nEPSs if you haven\u0026rsquo;t used EPSs or look at it, please consider looking at\nthat. And then in the whole concept of richer B, there\u0026rsquo;s been a fantastic\npresentation by Adam Berman where Vulnerabilities not a vulnerability.\nAnd also Timo from DSOM has been fantastic in the whole process of\nvulnerability management of Wix. We have a framework available to use.\n42:05\nA lot of these things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e42:06\nA small takeaway, we are a security company that focus absolutely on this.\nSo if you want to do this at scale and automate a lot of these vulnerability\ndecisions, we\u0026rsquo;re here for that.\n42:17\nStop the pitch.\n42:19\nBut we love OAS and we have a version available for OS. So scan the QR\ncode, get your Oasp edition. We want everybody to be able to not burn out\nand do vulnerability management at scale. And also, if you want to know\nmore, we have plenty of white paper around this that explain and explore\non this. And a master book on SLA and why we consider SLA of that and\nhow you can evolve your organization to go from pure vulnerability\nmanagement to SLA to security. OKR, and also we discuss a lot about this\non the podcast. We discuss cloud security and application security. So I\nwould invite everybody to visit the CSV, it\u0026rsquo;s also available on our website.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m going to open the floor to question because I\u0026rsquo;ve been talking a lot.\nThank you everyone.\n43:13\nCool, no? Great session as always, man. Yeah, if there\u0026rsquo;s anything, guys,\nplease put it in the chat. I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to I don\u0026rsquo;t see anything in there, but\ngive it a couple of minutes.\n43:23\nI don\u0026rsquo;t see the chat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e43:25\nI\u0026rsquo;ll keep an eye on it, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s that evolution, right? I know we start\ntalking about the chat gvt in the beginning and the AI. I feel that the\nbiggest challenge I always had with this is a lot of this, it makes complete\nsense. The question is how to scale it in a business that has that on\nsteroids. And not just that when you talk about context and talking to the\nbusiness is not one entity. If you think about it\u0026rsquo;s multiple entities with\nmultiple levels of stakeholders, multiple levels of seniority, multiple levels\nof priorities. And I think now we\u0026rsquo;re getting to the point. Not yet, but I\nthink we\u0026rsquo;re getting close to be able to mass customize some of the content\nwe have so we can really put into context, so we can get to that ten or 20\nthings that really matter for a particular stakeholder.\n44:20\nAnd I think with a new wave of analyzing a large set of data and of course\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a whole thing of cleaning it up, making sure it\u0026rsquo;s correct, make sure\nit\u0026rsquo;s well processed. But I feel that we\u0026rsquo;re able to provide to do this at a\nmuch highly scalable way once I mean, there.\n44:38\nIs LLM, there are language models, some of this we might find correlation\nin path. But a lot of this stuff is just collecting the data that we have\nalready and really basic stuff, it\u0026rsquo;s not like rocket science, it\u0026rsquo;s just getting\neverything. And as you rightfully say, Dennis is doing this at scale,\ncollecting all the vulnerability in one central location, grouping them by\nproduct. That is not rocket science. You can have some MLS like we\u0026rsquo;re\ndoing, like trying to patternize and see who is maintaining the same repo\nand maybe they are all part of the same product or who is doing the same\nissue. Over time you will start seeing trending and other stuff, even if you\ndo just basic aggregation and basic analysis and then you evolve in these\nthree R. So at the beginning you will do a lot of triage manually and then\nyou start automating some piece of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e45:26\nSo, yes, AI is very exciting, but.\n45:29\nIt\u0026rsquo;S very likely that it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to throw garbage in and to get garbage\nout. And I\u0026rsquo;m guilty as charged. Like I\u0026rsquo;ve done this because I get super\nexcited about the new technology and I say I don\u0026rsquo;t need to use your scale\nand then I get good result, bad results. So, experiment. Yes, absolutely. We\nhave a fantastic tool that is available out there to experiment mixed\nfeeling about result. Like we\u0026rsquo;ve been discussing with Sharif and he\u0026rsquo;s done\nsome interesting experiment. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t seen this, there\u0026rsquo;ve been a\nfantastic presentation he has done on Chat GPT and we\u0026rsquo;re fixing stuff\nactually or using chat GPT for code analysis. I\u0026rsquo;ve used it at scale as well\nmyself. And sometimes it gives you the right pointer. Sometimes if you ask\nthem to auto fix or auto patch remove specific piece of code. So makes the\ncode secure because it.\n46:23\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;T.\n46:25\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;T run the thing, right?\n46:27\nYeah, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t taught to be dead, it just happened to be dead because\nit has a lot of language and a lot of good and bad examples. So maybe if\nwe train something on good and bad example, maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll have some\nmore precise LLM.\n46:42\nBut as everything, we still have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e46:46\nFix the basic and we still have to fix the basic stuff because business\ncontext, the way to talk to the business that\u0026rsquo;s still on us internally.\n46:55\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s where I have to say I\u0026rsquo;ve already had some good success on\nprompting because you can start to prompt the audience that you\u0026rsquo;re going\nto have. You can say I\u0026rsquo;m speaking to this person which runs this and this is\nthe context, this is the objectives, this is the issues, right?\n47:09\nAnd I think we\u0026rsquo;re doing prompt engineering on people.\n47:13\nIt\u0026rsquo;s context, right? It\u0026rsquo;s basically providing ideas. And I think if you look at\nthe latest stuff on Palm two and vertex and I think being able to start to\nteach the models with the data that we have and then fine tune it, this is\nwhere the worldly maps is interesting, right? Because the LLM pushed all\nthe stuff to the right. And now you\u0026rsquo;re going to start to see these security\nLLMs coming to market, and they will be very laser sharp. Focus on\ncertain things. The same way that you have a medicine focus. One, you\nnow start to have security. Imagine having a risk one having imagine\nfeeding the ISO, the GDPR standards, the internal policies, all the kind of\nthe OAS. Yes, all that stuff.\n48:01\nAnd then starting there is already somebody.\n48:04\nThat has developed that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e48:06\nIt\u0026rsquo;s super powerful.\n48:08\nGRE.\n48:09\nYeah, it\u0026rsquo;s crazy powerful. All right, man, look, I don\u0026rsquo;t think we got\nquestions here, so thanks again for doing these great sessions, and I\u0026rsquo;ll.\n48:18\nSee you on the next one. See you guys.\n48:21\nThank you very much.\n48:22\nStay safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2023/mini-summits/Jun/DevSecOps/","event":"mini-summit","expirydate":-62135596800,"facebook":null,"fuzzywordcount":8100,"hey_summit":"https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZMpcu2opzIuE9OWSFEtXBTALTeDEvq6IWSl","image":null,"job_title":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752075784,"layout":"","linkedin":null,"notes":null,"objectID":"4ff720add18cdbfbebd677f3f07d5249","organizers":["Francesco Cipollone"],"permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/shift-smart-risk-based-approach-on-appsec/","project":null,"publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":38,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/shift-smart-risk-based-approach-on-appsec/","section":"sessions","status":null,"summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-session\"\u003eAbout this session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShifting left had success, shifting right and adding context is hot as the number of vulnerabilities pre-flight in an SDLC is piling up.

Hi. Welcome to this first session of the Open Security Summit in\nOctober 2023. We have an amazing content this week, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to\nstart with a bang of shifting right security instead of shifting left without\ngoing all the way to the right and emphasizing the post deployment\nmonitoring and response panel. So it\u0026rsquo;s me, Omar and Marius. I think\nmaybe Omar Mario, just give a quick introduction about yourself and then\nwe can kick start. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 00:35\nSo regarding incident response, I used to work at the Israeli serve the\nCyber Emergency Response Team, and we used to work for trying to\nunderstand the apt threats and state nation kind of actors. And right now,\nuntil recently, I was the head of research for Enzo Security, and were\nacquired a few months back by SNC. So currently I\u0026rsquo;m on the SNC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 01:17\nKind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 01:17\nOf ASPM and also risk and strategy product at Snake. So that\u0026rsquo;s it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 01:27\nCool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 01:29\nMy name is Marius. I\u0026rsquo;m Vice President of Cybersecurity for Glo Financial\nServices. So I essentially run the cybersecurity program for Glo. We are a\nfintech business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 01:42\nBoom. Let me do a positioning here. Right. So I think there\u0026rsquo;s a view, which\nby the way, is correct, right? Like the sooner we do security, the best.\nRight. One of the things I always like with the deployment, basically the\nmonitoring and incident response is that in a weird way, it\u0026rsquo;s the perfect\nvalidator for everything we do. So I\u0026rsquo;ll give an example. So one of my\nfavorite things is to run P Three incidents. As P one, you take a mid level\nincident, you run it as a P one, you put a lot of resources, you put a lot of\nyour team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 02:21\nAnd usually the reason, the business reason I say that is, for example, if we\ndiscover a vulnerability from monitoring or we have an incident that the\ncustomer told us about, the P One is not the particular incident, it\u0026rsquo;s not\nthe particular fraud, it\u0026rsquo;s not the particular thing that it was done at the\ntime. Right. Because that might be a P Three from a business point of\nview. The P One is because we missed things in here. So can you guys\nexpand a bit on this concept of, in a way, using almost our monitoring and\nour instance response as almost validators that the other security\nmeasures that we\u0026rsquo;re doing and the other areas of security that we don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave major gaps?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 03:07\nI\u0026rsquo;ll start with from one particular angle. I think when you look at most of\nthe organizations and most of the big breaches nowadays, a lot of stuff is\nhappening based on and we always talk about, oh, it\u0026rsquo;s because of human\nerror, but we never look at sort of problems upstream, why we allowed for\nhuman to make an error, what\u0026rsquo;s the root cause? And that\u0026rsquo;s the problem, I\nguess. Cybersecurity, I think, is still an immature program if you compare\nto something like aviation and things like that, where we put a lot of\nemphasis in testing to make sure that humans are less likely to make\nerrors. So I think we need to obviously think a bit more programmatic and\ntalk about and do more root cause analysis of why things are happening,\nwhy we get incidents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 04:04\nWe talk a lot about technical solutions, but what\u0026rsquo;s the business processes\nand procedures upstream that allows things to be missed. So I think that\u0026rsquo;s\nthe main thing where we need to think more proactively and be more\nproactive in addressing the issues. I\u0026rsquo;m a big proponent what you just\ndiscussed. So I like to build sort of modular security pieces that anyone\nwho\u0026rsquo;s building, whether it\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure, whether they\u0026rsquo;re building code,\nthey can reuse security pieces, whether it\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s the whitelisted image\nthat we use for our infrastructure machines? What? Scanning tools, what\nthings we need to deploy within those machines to make sure that they are\nreporting. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s our seam, whether it\u0026rsquo;s our monitoring. The more\nyou can add and allow teams to leverage that, the easier life will be,\nbasically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 05:02\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 05:05\nSo yeah, I think there\u0026rsquo;s a lot to that question and a lot to that answer also\nbecause the thing is that application security kind of the whole space was\nvery changed over time. Many of the tools are also in an effort to shift left,\nright the industry. And a lot of the tools wants to doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if it\u0026rsquo;s tools\nthat run by an attacker or a pen tester or an hacker, a white attacker. So\nthat\u0026rsquo;s one kind of thing to understand that there\u0026rsquo;s always going to be\nfallouts, there\u0026rsquo;s always going to be missed things no matter what. And still\nthere are p one, p two, p three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 05:59\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s true that a lot of efforts of a lot of organizations also are like to\nget a sense of if there\u0026rsquo;s something that\u0026rsquo;s like a problem that we are\nproving in a specific organization might point to something. That could be\ndone better at the platform level or being dealt with a single time across\nthe board and open a real issue and solve it. And also in terms of incident\nresponse, it\u0026rsquo;s true that you want to have logs and capabilities and those\nkind of elevations that you want to test. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to meet with a\nnew kind of attack surface first time when it\u0026rsquo;s a real incident. You might\nwant to practice and see the full kind of how do you react and see that if\nyou have any pitfalls or any blind spots you can fix it for the next event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 07:03\nThe practice is kind of my point, right? So the idea is that instead of\nwaiting for the P ones and you have your dusty old playbooks that nobody\never going to use and not have things, if you practice using those low level\nincidents then you really improve your practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 07:23\nBecause I think the important bit as well in here is everyone develops a\ncertain level of playbooks, how do you respond to those specific scenarios?\nBut we all know that incidents does not always follow the playbook\nscenarios. So your practice and muscle sort of memory training allows you\nto better respond to various situations. And as well I think you need to sort\nof look towards what culture you\u0026rsquo;re building out within teams because you\ndon\u0026rsquo;t want someone blindly following playbook if it leads down the rabbit\nholes and non holes. So we build the rules for people to follow, but we\nneed to empower people to neglect the rules to make sure that they make\nthe right decisions when they need to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 08:09\nSo in a way that could be a bigger incident, right? Like for example, if you\nthink about it, if you have a playbook and then somebody is following the\nplaybook blindly, you almost want to create an incident on top of that.\nBecause in a pragmatic way the quality of the playbook should be directly\nrelated to the fact that when the last time it was used, it added a lot of\nvalue and it made a lot of sense. So a good playbook in a way gets better\nwith every incident, right? Keeps being refined and a bad playbook is\nignored and then you know, already you answer that actually the way that\nthing occurred has nothing to do with the way we thought it was going to\nhappen. Actually this is what happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 08:46\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s why you want to capture because I view playbooks as the future\nquestions or the sequence of questions that you want to ask, right? This\noccur, ask these five questions, get these answers, okay, that occurs, ask\nthese five questions. So then it\u0026rsquo;s like a tree, right? A real playbook should\nreally be a graph. You go here, you go there and at every stage you should\nhave almost like okay, now I need to know this, now I need to know that.\nBecause incident sometimes we\u0026rsquo;ll go back and say oh, actually the real\nquestion we only ask on hour ten or day three or whatever. But actually\nwe should have asked that question right at the beginning. And I see that\nin the incidents that we handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 09:25\nAnd the reason why we put a lot of resources in the incidents is because\nwe build those playbooks, we build those practices and we really go from\nincidents that sometimes take two or three days to incidents the same\nthing takes 2 hours and is even better handled because we put all the\nprocesses in place and the technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 09:43\nYeah, and I think that also it goes to the point of the changes that we used\nto kind of view. A lot of it security realm was about response to events that\nare the developer station or server stations and a lot of the time today the\nhandlers are applicative, they are a GitHub action or something like that\nare developers. So there is actually a new sense of forensics for\napplication that most teams are not really I don\u0026rsquo;t think they need to go\nand kind of see lateral movement within the application, CI and so on. It\u0026rsquo;s\nkind of like what is the real incident response kind of job, right? The\ndescription of that kind of who does that in the team? Is it like a dedicated\njob? Is it an outside team?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 10:57\nIs it like a lot of people, just when I meet them at organization, it\u0026rsquo;s not\nreally clear because it\u0026rsquo;s not like, okay, someone hacked a computer. We\nknow what to do. We can rotate his keys, but what keys should we rotate\nthis? And so there should be a playbook for those because you should kind\nof with time address it enough to understand that you need to have a\nplaybook. And in terms of generally elevation and how you treat it, I think\nat most places you consider someone who is something that was reported\nexternally by some whitehead hacker or some reporting tool as higher\nlevel of incident generally rather than something was discovered internally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 11:54\nYeah. So, Maris, let\u0026rsquo;s go back to I really like that where we\u0026rsquo;re going with\nthe whole idea asking why did the human made the error or why did the\nerror occur? Forgetting if it\u0026rsquo;s human or not. Right. And what I like about\nthe shifting the right side of security is that it\u0026rsquo;s very fact based. Right. In\nan interesting way is the more you go to the left, the more hypothetical\nyou become. Yes. The more impact you can have with the change. But also\nthe more sometimes you don\u0026rsquo;t have context where the more to the right\nyou are, the closer you are with something actually happened. This is data,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 12:29\nSo if you look at that, why the error occurred, that visibility and that\ninstance response, in a way, those are the signals that we should be\nexploring to understand why do we got lucky, right? It\u0026rsquo;s a bit like, hey, we\njust found some malicious guy inside our building. He happened to be\nmaking coffee. It\u0026rsquo;s like in the coffee machine or helping himself to the\nsnacks. But if that person had walked to the right instead to the left, you\u0026rsquo;d\nhave found our vault. Now, usually we\u0026rsquo;ll go and says, oh, no problem,\nbecause the only thing you were doing was eating some snacks. But I think\nwe should go. How is it even possible that person, for example, bypassed a\nbunch of controls to allow them to be in that part of the building?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 13:19\nMy key point here is that let\u0026rsquo;s do that when we\u0026rsquo;re not in a mission critical\nsituation where we\u0026rsquo;re facing with a massive advanced attack that will\nrespond and we don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of margin for error, let\u0026rsquo;s do that a bit\nsooner when we get those signals that told us something wrong happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 13:37\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a thing I think sometimes we need to be proactive and go into\ndeeper levels understanding our staff potentially attackers psychology.\nWhen I talked about, for example, stuff like human error. So we\u0026rsquo;re talking\nabout, for example, simple example, phishing. Why people click on\nphishing links. Nobody looks at how many emails do people need to open\nper day? Is it their job for example, to open attachments? Like invoices if\nthat\u0026rsquo;s their job, opening those emails. Twenty four, seven or say whatever,\neight or five. Every single day they need to open 200 emails. It\u0026rsquo;s very\nunlikely that they will always going to spot a phishing attack. So you\u0026rsquo;re\nrelying on that person who\u0026rsquo;s the last line of defense. So how we can help\nthem, whether it\u0026rsquo;s end user awareness training, whether it\u0026rsquo;s tools,\nunderstanding motivations. Why, for example, something like MGM\naccount hack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 14:39\nWhy does people divulge their credentials? What\u0026rsquo;s the culture we are\nbuilding in a team? Are people disgruntled? Are they not happy? What\ncould lead to inside their attack?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 14:54\nBut I think it\u0026rsquo;s more interesting to think, let\u0026rsquo;s assume that they will do it,\nright? Let\u0026rsquo;s assume they will click, let\u0026rsquo;s assume that they will diverse their\ncredentials. In a weird way, it\u0026rsquo;s almost like a honeypot, right? I view that\nas I\u0026rsquo;m more worried by the fact that why didn\u0026rsquo;t we pick up that something\nbad happened? Why didn\u0026rsquo;t we pick up that the next thing that the\nattackers did? Because I love the statement of a zero day is not an\ninvisibility cloak, right? Like, okay, you click on the link, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t\nmake the attacker invisible. If anything, all the other actions are visible\nand we should have enough process systems, understanding, visualizations\nright, to detect that, hey, this just happened, right? That installer just got\nexecuted. That credential just got compromised over here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 15:45\nAnd we should have, again, the whole not the bandwagon, but the zero\ntrust model where suddenly if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to access highly sensitive data\nfrom a device that we don\u0026rsquo;t recognize, we should go, hold on. That should\nnot be possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 15:59\nAnd I think it leads to I even made a post today, I asked a couple of weeks\nago about cybersecurity professionals. What\u0026rsquo;s your non negotiables when\nyou step into a new role? And normally we start talking people MFA, how\nto protect credentials and users and user awareness training and all of\nthat. That is all great. But I think most organizations, what they lack is\nasset management and visibility into all of the assets. So if you\u0026rsquo;re missing\n10% of your assets, yeah, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what you\u0026rsquo;re going to do, it\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what controls you\u0026rsquo;re going to apply. If you can\u0026rsquo;t see 10% of\nyour assets, how they are configured, whether they are hardened, that\ntalks into visibility. Because the thing is, and the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 16:38\nIs that\u0026rsquo;s how I do it. So if I have anything related to a device that we don\u0026rsquo;t\nmanage, I raise that as a P one. Because I\u0026rsquo;m like, we just got an\nunmanaged device that we had no idea where it came from, but we know\nit\u0026rsquo;s ours or we know it\u0026rsquo;s part of our domain. Right. So for me that\u0026rsquo;s the P\none, but ideally you want to almost edge your luck to say, let\u0026rsquo;s have those\nbefore it\u0026rsquo;s the big one. Because guess what? Doing normal business\ndevelopment, people would do things that are the same. They\u0026rsquo;re not\nmalicious, but they will be doing things from unmanaged devices that we\ngo, oh, that\u0026rsquo;s a bit fishy. Exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 17:15\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s the thing. Not having visibility, you can\u0026rsquo;t detect things. So\nmaking sure you have a proper asset management and then you build on\nthat. You build how you on board assets, how you gain visibility and shift\ntowards that. Right. To make sure that you have that monitoring in place,\nyou have detection, you keep training and going through scenarios. I\nalways say to people, failing to prepare equals to slowly failing to prepare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 17:43\nYeah, exactly. Well, let\u0026rsquo;s bring Nitin a little bit because I think he asked a\nreally good question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 17:52\nHi Denise. Hey Marius. Hello Mar. I had a question for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 17:58\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 17:58\nSo as we look at the incident side of it, would love to get on your thoughts\non with the incidents which are happening. How are you encouraging your\nteams? And it could be the AppSec team, it could be the development\nteams, it could be others to learn from that. So say for example, as part of\nan incident and a few of these which have happened recently, where there\nwas like a code related bug or there was like secrets related bugs which\nwere there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 18:27\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 18:28\nHow are you now taking those learnings and saying, hey, I could have\nstopped this if I go and make a slight change earlier in the process. So\nmaybe as part of my SAS scanning, maybe as part of my secrets or other\nthings that I\u0026rsquo;m doing earlier in the development cycle so that I can now\nkind of reduce the impact of this vulnerability class. So I\u0026rsquo;m just going to\npause there, see if there\u0026rsquo;s any if that question makes sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 18:58\nYeah, I think for me personally, I always think about any particular\nsecurity initiatives. It starts with top down approach. So whether you start\nlaunching AppSec, program, vulnerability management program, any kind\nof program where you\u0026rsquo;re trying to get better maturity and discover things,\nit\u0026rsquo;s how does the roll down from the top? How are they supported?\nBecause everyone\u0026rsquo;s talking about nowadays AppSec DevSecOps, but\nnormally it\u0026rsquo;s still siloed. You have a DevOps and then, oh, let\u0026rsquo;s bolt on\nsecurity on a DevOps and it\u0026rsquo;s all of a sudden it\u0026rsquo;s going to become\nDevSecOps. And I always say to people, if you truly want to reach\nDevSecOps, it takes at least twelve to 18 months to build a culture, to\nbuild the Security Champions Network. How are you going to incentivize\nthose security champions? That\u0026rsquo;s the one thing I think some organizations\nalways miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 19:53\nWe always talk security is sort of a measurement of quality of the code. So\nif you can build security and quality into development, KPIs build Security\nChampions Network how you can incentivize them through whether it\u0026rsquo;s\ngift cards, money, security conferences. When you start talking and start\nunderstanding developers, pick anything that for example, developers that\nmissed in a code. If you can showcase a high breach of the missed code\nand how does that help businesses to reduce the potential spend? Save on\nbottom line, save the bugs. We\u0026rsquo;re always talking about shifting left\nbecause production bugs fixes is normally ten times the cost if you can fix\nthem in a sort of threat modeling exercises. So just grasping that\nunderstanding and why we\u0026rsquo;re doing things, because normally developers,\nthey get a ticket in their, say, jira fix that bug, they don\u0026rsquo;t have a context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 20:56\nSo for them, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean nothing, yes, I\u0026rsquo;ll fix it, but what\u0026rsquo;s the\nconcept? What\u0026rsquo;s the outcome of that bug if it goes into production and\nthen the learning curve, because once they learned the outcome, that can\nhappen, what\u0026rsquo;s the risk? But chances are you won\u0026rsquo;t see that same bug\nfrom the same team next time. So to me, that\u0026rsquo;s how you go about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 21:22\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a good question, and for me, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of to do with confidence of the\ndevelopers in the tools and in the responses they get. And right now, I don\u0026rsquo;t\nthink that as a whole, as a field application security gives a lot of\nconfidence in findings and we need to do a lot better. And a lot of the\nthings that goes there, it\u0026rsquo;s really important that they\u0026rsquo;ll be discussed\nbecause it\u0026rsquo;s a fine line of agreement and kind of acceptance between right\nsecurity and the RND, and we can tone those knobs to fit it better. And so\nif it\u0026rsquo;s transparent, what do I mean by that? So a lot of the times tools are\nreporting false positives, and we want the developers to understand what\nare the efforts that we add to the tools to not let that interfere, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 22:28\nTo kind of overcome it. Okay. And if they are persuaded, it has like two\nmeanings. First, that they understand that it\u0026rsquo;s something that they need to\ndeal with and that it\u0026rsquo;s real, hopefully. And two, that they can maybe\nsuggest things and they have a lot of more knowledge as to what can be\nautomatically signed as a mock or a test or whatever and build more\nconfidence in the findings. But still, I think reproducibility for me when I\nwas developing, when you have a bug, a state of the task could be cannot\nreproduce, and that\u0026rsquo;s it. So I don\u0026rsquo;t believe in giving developers bugs that\nthey cannot reproduce because they either won\u0026rsquo;t fix it or they won\u0026rsquo;t fix it,\nright. Because they can debug it and they can understand it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 23:29\nOkay. But if you look at the case that Nathan was mentioning, in a way\nthat solves the false positive because it is a true positive, right. Like, we\nknow it\u0026rsquo;s been exploited and we know it\u0026rsquo;s connected an incident, right?\nSo, Nathan, one of the reasons why I do put a treaty as a P one is because\nyou need the development resources. You see, the problem is, when you\ntreat it as a normal incidence, the objective is let\u0026rsquo;s reduce, I would say, the\nimpact of the bug, right? And usually it\u0026rsquo;s about stop the exploit, do\nsomething about it, plug the hole, right? Get it there, right. In a lot of\ncases, that could be done reasonably quickly, right? Because it\u0026rsquo;s almost\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a signal, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 24:14\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something that you can do very quickly that would, if not solve the\nvulnerability, broke the path, the attack path, right. The reason why you\nkind of want to run it as a bigger incident is because you need the\nresources to do what Omera was talking about, which is, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure\nthat we connect the dots, right? So it\u0026rsquo;s not a false positive. So, for\nexample, write a unit test, write integration tests. Write something that\nreplicates the problem. So when you go to the devs and you say, hey, guys,\nwe need to fix this, right? It\u0026rsquo;s actually a real exploitable path in their\nenvironment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 24:52\nAnd then if we then have the horsepower and that\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s important to\nbring people to the party, because you want to look at what other bugs\nyou have that are similar to this, and then what other near misses you\nhave. And the beauty of that is that you can take those maybe mid level\nfindings or findings that were in that category of going, we don\u0026rsquo;t know, or\nno exploit being published, et cetera, or no exploitability right now. And\nyou can flip all of them and going, oh, by the way, we now have evidence\nthat this has been exploited, right? And then you can use that to try to fix a\nlot of things. But I would also argue that fix things during the incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 25:35\nI\u0026rsquo;m great fan of chaos engineering. And then you can flip and keep going,\nand iterating forward. That\u0026rsquo;s why I said top down support. Imagine you\nget top down support. So, say, let\u0026rsquo;s do a week CTF. All the teams switch,\nall the dev teams. You try and find bugs in another team\u0026rsquo;s code, and you\njust do a full week CTF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 25:58\nImagine, but do it on top of this incident. Man. The thing about that, right,\nwhat I found is that there\u0026rsquo;s a connection, there\u0026rsquo;s a human connection\nincidents not just to that, but to kind of everything around it that doesn\u0026rsquo;t\nexist when it\u0026rsquo;s artificial, right? And that\u0026rsquo;s why if you do a tabletop exercise\nor by the way, CTFs is brilliant. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying don\u0026rsquo;t do that. I\u0026rsquo;m just\nsaying that the scenario that Nathan was talking about, which is on the\ntop of a real incident, there\u0026rsquo;s a whole almost blast radius that you can\nleverage. And at that moment in time, you know, my trick, Nathan, is to\nfind the spots that we don\u0026rsquo;t have good answers. If you especially during an\nincident, there\u0026rsquo;s always a nebula period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 26:46\nAnd what you\u0026rsquo;ll find is that very quickly people move into the let\u0026rsquo;s address\nthe problem, not why is this a problem? Right. So it\u0026rsquo;s almost like it\u0026rsquo;s not\njust like imagine there\u0026rsquo;s the little dot that you got to hit, but there\u0026rsquo;s also a\nblast radius that you can now exploit, right, to say, let\u0026rsquo;s say, for example,\nas a vulnerability on a website that allows you to read data from the\nserver, right. Then you can say, okay, so in principle, all the secrets could\nbe compromised. Right? Now don\u0026rsquo;t wait for evidence that the secrets have\nbeen compromised because nobody\u0026rsquo;s going to argue, especially if you\nhaven\u0026rsquo;t. First of all, there could be a real scenario, but more importantly,\nnobody\u0026rsquo;s going to argue that it\u0026rsquo;s not valid because there\u0026rsquo;s now a path. We\ngot somebody that was browsing the directory structure. The data was\nthere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 27:37\nThe fact that the person has, wear it or not, is less important than let\u0026rsquo;s\nminimize the impact of this. So suddenly you raise the questions, why do\nwe have secrets in the source code? So suddenly you can have the teams\nhave a lot more empathy to all the tickets that talk about secrets in source\ncode. Because you go, see guys, that\u0026rsquo;s why we worry about that. So then\ninstance like this, it\u0026rsquo;s not a problem. Then you look, why is that container\nrunning as root? Or why is that container overprivileged? Or why is that\nnot locked down as much as we could? Because if it was, none of these\nproblems would exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 28:14\nYeah, and you can keep digging deeper and then that\u0026rsquo;s how you build\nsecure processes going forward. Why did it slip into the repository? Why\ndo we have secrets there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 28:28\nYeah, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen one organization use the five wise. So let\u0026rsquo;s say there was\nsome obscure it\u0026rsquo;s a niche bug like related to access control or user\nauthorization. So now what you do is you look at that and then you say,\nhey, how do we go and check? Because developers tend to leverage each\nother\u0026rsquo;s code. How do we go and check which are the other 1520 other\nplaces where the same issue has happened? And now on the back of the\nincident that you have, you can now give visibility to those developers in\nterms of, hey, because of this one thing, think about these other 20 places\nwhere the same issue is happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 29:10\nAnd because you\u0026rsquo;ve got the leverage from this incident, you could actually\ngo ahead and either get them to, of course, fix it, as Dennis said, plug the\nhole, but also say, hey, how do I check for the next time that this 21st place\ndoes not happen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 29:23\nYeah. So now let me bring my favorite topic, right? Which is this is the\nmoment of the conversation that I always got a little bit depressed, right?\nNot visibly, but if my heart a little bit will die because I knew that we\ncouldn\u0026rsquo;t scale, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t do what you just described, right? Because to\ndo what you just described required us to be able to have a level of\nunderstanding of code. Let me rewrite this. For that to be possible, we\nwould need to be able to take that incident, take a particular app, a\nparticular environment, a particular development, particular code base,\nand write that incident translated for that environment. Right. Now, up\nuntil recently, for me, that was impossible. You couldn\u0026rsquo;t do it right. We\ntried. Or you needed a huge amount of human power, which again, didn\u0026rsquo;t\nscale at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 30:12\nSo this is the area where I think Gen AI will make the crazy difference,\nright? It\u0026rsquo;s not on the writing stuff automatically, it\u0026rsquo;s not on replacing\nhumans, it\u0026rsquo;s not on writing code, all that stuff that people get very hyped\nabout. I think it\u0026rsquo;s the ability to write messages or to explain what we want\nin context and have an event where, let\u0026rsquo;s say if I take your, you know,\nnithyan the workflow where you go, you feed the bot and say, look, Chat\nGPT, I say, look, this just happened. Here\u0026rsquo;s the impact. Now I\u0026rsquo;m going to\nspeak to this team and that team has this and this and these findings. Now\nexplain to me or explain that team the impact of this. And that\u0026rsquo;s massive\nbecause we\u0026rsquo;re now translating this into business context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 31:04\nAnd that is the kind of things that actually Chat DBT does really well. So\nwhat do you think of that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 31:13\nHang on, I\u0026rsquo;m saying a lot of now those talk about moving from\nvulnerability management to risk management. And that\u0026rsquo;s basically the\nidea of getting the context for every environment. Because if someone\nbroke your staging environment, which you have mock data, then okay, I\nguess it\u0026rsquo;s nice, but if it\u0026rsquo;s production with PII data of customers, then it\u0026rsquo;s\nvery different. Shifting left gave us a lot of understanding around the team\nand around the code. And if you go to, like, you now have swagger that\nmight describe your API, or protobuff that might describe clients and APIs\nvery clearly, but tying it together with where everything is deployed is kind\nof going to be, I think, the golden standard for understanding your risk for\nevery kind of issue or incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 32:22\nYeah. What do you guys think? Myers gen AI for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 32:28\nI think Genai has obviously its applications, I think is obviously just as\nwith anything else. It depends how you build the model and what data you\nuse. If you have enough data, enough context, and enough sort of data\npoints to leverage it. Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 32:47\nIn this case, we do, right, because we have the incident, we know the team\nis going well. We might even have the vulnerabilities that exist on that. You\ncan even throw in some of your policies. So. You can now build a coherent\nnarrative, even to do list, right. For one is to happen, but you can now\nbuild almost like the whole project description, why are we doing this?\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the business impact, what\u0026rsquo;s the risk impact, what\u0026rsquo;s the technical\nresources, what to do, et cetera, all based on that piece of evidence and\nthat particular event, which in this case, again, is what Nitin was talking\nabout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 33:23\nYeah, because it will allow us to better correlate events, to better\nunderstand how does that, as Nitin said, or as we discussed, how does that\none thing impact everything else around, where let\u0026rsquo;s scan all the code,\nwhere there is duplications of that potential problem. And let\u0026rsquo;s do a nice\nsummary for me, because instead of creating lists and lists of lists, how do\nwe risk over it and what do we really care? Because I think the one thing\nthat historically insecurity, we\u0026rsquo;ve been kind of problematic with know, we\nfind hundreds and hundreds of issues and then we shout to everyone, oh,\nwe need to fix everything. We need to fix everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 34:03\nWe need context, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 34:04\nImpossible. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 34:06\nSo actually, Michael, can you join in? So Mike Hidalgo here, and we go\nback quite a long time, and he\u0026rsquo;s also very heavily involved in threat\nmodeling. And actually, I was listening to Gary\u0026rsquo;s McGraw, one of the\nrecent podcasts, and one of the things he said was one unsolved problems\nis scaling threat modeling, right, is how to scale. And I think if you connect\nto this again, one of the problems we always had in the past was how do\nwe have good data and how do you create threat models in context where\nin a way, imagine if a thread model is now dynamically generated from\ndata. It means that when the scenario that Nitin is talking about,\nsomething just happens, we can now connect. That right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 34:50\nSo we can start to have these threat models that feed from context\nanalysis of an architecture that has already been created by an LLM.\nRight? But then the thread modeling itself can be dynamically generated\nor updated as events occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 35:06\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 35:07\nI was thinking when you mentioned AI for this, definitely a really nice Use\ncase is really threat modeling, where you can have all of this data\npopulated from multiple places. That can help you even to brainstorm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 35:22\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 35:23\nBecause at the end of the day, threat modeling is about collaboration,\nright. So if you are able to ask the right questions to the right problem,\nmaybe you can work backwards from a given incident right, to try to find,\noh, this is the use case I do have, what are my potential threats? How can\nI improve this? How can you go from the detection to the prevention? So\nthis is really a game changer. Specifically, as you wanted to scale right\nacross multiple teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 35:48\nNow you can translate the thread model to all sorts of different audiences,\nright? Imagine the thread model as the foundational graph. In fact, I\nalways found that the challenge with thread model was either non fisibility\nor too much visibility, non f granularity, too much granularity, right. Where\nnow you almost can have these foundational thread models and then we\nactually use an LLM to translate that to a particular audience. So you can\nhave context whether you can have your findings, you can have your\nvulnerabilities, your exploits, where your monitoring then becomes a key\npiece of that because it gives you almost the evidence that whatever we\u0026rsquo;re\nseeing on the left, actually there\u0026rsquo;s the impacts on the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 36:30\nYeah, absolutely. And also as a second opinion, right. Specifically in terms\nof threat model, where you need several feedback loops, right, and you\nneed to have more people involved asking the right questions. These kind\nof models can give you a lot of visibility, things that you are not even\nconsidering when looking through the eyes from the detective perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 36:51\nAnd I always think the view that especially in this bit here, it\u0026rsquo;s not about\nthe gen AI and the LLMs, right, to replace the whole lot. Right. It\u0026rsquo;s about\naugmenting our capabilities. So, for example, in the past, the best, most\neffective threat models experience I had was my team was creating threat\nmodels, and I was almost just reviewing it. And I would be able to be very\nproductive because I was able to see which teams actually were doing\nokay, which teams were not even on a ballpark, like, which ones have no\nidea where they were looking at, and which teams actually went over the\ntop. But also I noticed I was being very productive because I could use my\nexperience, I could teach others and then I would review it. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 37:32\nAt the end of the day, you always need somebody as an expertise to sign it\noff. But the ability the problem in that world was then the cost of creating\nthe new versions was very high. So things became out of date. We could\nchange that. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 37:50\nAnd even get maturity. Right. You get to that stage faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 37:55\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 37:55\nWith the right tools, especially, I think you can take it up to the next level.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re talking a lot about technical stuff, but when you create a tools that\nbased on gen AI, who can take and analyze specific, whether it\u0026rsquo;s\nprocedure flow, specific architecture flow, you can expand to nontechnical\nteams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 38:14\nAbsolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 38:14\nImagine some of your nontechnical teams start building a specific business\nprocedure, specifically business workflow, new product, before they even\ngo into the technical routes. They can get the early outputs of where the\npotential risks and dangers lie to make the informed decisions as early as\npossible. And that\u0026rsquo;s, I think, to me is invaluable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 38:34\nBut that was always the elephant in the room of thread modeling. Right.\nIn another world, we could have been a lot more brutal with the dev teams\nand saying, dude, you don\u0026rsquo;t have an architecture diagram that isn\u0026rsquo;t up to\ndate. Like, what the fuck? Right? Like, come on, seriously. Right? But we\ncan\u0026rsquo;t say that, right? And to be honest, the system is rigged against the\ndevs and the architects. So it\u0026rsquo;s not their fault. But it\u0026rsquo;s insane. Right? It\u0026rsquo;s\nlike, imagine you\u0026rsquo;re doing a security review of a building and you go, okay,\ncan you give me the schematics? And they go, yeah, we don\u0026rsquo;t have it. Well,\nI can draw you how the building works, I can give you a drawing of where\nthe doors are, how you go in, where the vault is. Right. But it\u0026rsquo;s insane,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 39:12\nThe application, the networks, the cloud environments, nobody\nunderstands how the hell that thing is set up these days. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 39:20\nYeah. So threat modeling really part of it. I think usage should be kind of\nsometimes the first place that everything comes together in a single review\nof flows instead of like, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, APIs review and stuff like that. So in\nthat essence, a lot of the time we don\u0026rsquo;t save like I see a lot of teams that\nuses to do threat modeling and then it archived somewhere and no one\nsees it. And that should be validated the next time there\u0026rsquo;s an incident.\nShould be validated against the last. Exactly understand why it didn\u0026rsquo;t\ncome. And also we live in an agile world where APIs are not static and\nthey\u0026rsquo;re changing. And some changes should require have another security\nlook and some doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 40:14\nSo you just touch a topic that I would love if we became more real is new\nstuff should be an incident. So for example, if you have a new API that just\npopped up that nobody knew about, that should be an incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 40:28\nYeah, because back to risk and the ability to have some kind of a priority\nbecause there are some things that you would want to set that knob very\nhigh if it\u0026rsquo;s PCI related.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 40:42\nExactly, right. That\u0026rsquo;s the thing. So monitoring gives you that. So if you\nthink about it, monitoring is our I think when you guys just mentioned it\nshould be the validation of all our understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 40:56\nYou need to have a policy regardless of what you currently have. You need\nto know what you want as an organization to say like, you know, that I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t know, you cannot accept whatever, something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a\nsecond review or not. And then you go and check what is the status if\nsomething is violating it or not. But we need to understand what the\norganization need to have a policy what should go under review or not.\nRegardless if he have one single review member, like one single\napplication security in his organization or not, he needs to know, does he\nwant a security review?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 41:39\nA really cool project to do would be to use LLM to write the policies of\nwhat happens today. Like for example, imagine reverse engineering your\nexisting policies from what you see in your monitoring and instance\nresponse because that\u0026rsquo;s real data, right? So for example, you say we have\na policy that things don\u0026rsquo;t get reviewed. We could say actually, your policy\nshould say actually, your policy should actually say, we don\u0026rsquo;t review code\nbefore it goes live. Or we don\u0026rsquo;t review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 42:15\nThat\u0026rsquo;S where your controls should be. That\u0026rsquo;s how you should set well,\nnumber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 42:20\nWhat? I\u0026rsquo;m saying is that we could be a bit passive aggressive here by\ncreating policies that when you read it, you\u0026rsquo;re going, well, I\u0026rsquo;m not\ncomfortable with this policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 42:27\nAnd I think one thing that we very rarely talk about, and I think the more\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been digging into it so normally in organization who develops policies,\nGRC department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 42:38\nOh, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 42:39\nWho has to follow is engineering and does GRC know how engineering\nthere\u0026rsquo;s people who creating policies who have no clue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 42:51\nWhat exceptions you need the connection again, that\u0026rsquo;s where I feel again,\nGenai can make a massive difference is connecting basically a policy\nwhich fundamentally is a risk based or how we want to behave with\nreality. In fact the policy should be a graph, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 43:09\nTranslating policy into actions yes, but more importantly connect them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 43:14\nSo it should be a graph, right? So you should be able to look at imagine\nbeing able to look at a policy and say, that policy is currently no enforced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 43:21\nYeah, because normally what you have and here it applies, but it\u0026rsquo;s broken,\nbecause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 43:28\nNormally what you have is you create a set of policies, and policies are\nreviewed by senior leadership who has no clue what these policies mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 43:35\nBut even when they do right, the problem is enforcement, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 43:37\nYeah but as I\u0026rsquo;m saying, you need people who actually so say if I\u0026rsquo;m writing\nsecure software development policy, I need an output of all the software\ndevelopment teams to make sure that it aligns to their day to day work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 43:49\nSo I then I\u0026rsquo;ll try to be passive aggressive in saying I\u0026rsquo;ve done things in the\npast, I say that policy is not forcible that policy today is completely so\nwe\u0026rsquo;re breaking that policy left, right and center and here\u0026rsquo;s a risk for you\nto accept. So now your choice is you either change the policy or you\naccept that it\u0026rsquo;s completely broken and there\u0026rsquo;s no way you can do it in the\nnext year. So that\u0026rsquo;s again, how you can bring the responsibility of people\nsigning up the policy to say you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be signing up a policy that\nactually has no chance in hell to being usable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 44:21\nRight, but the problem I always had again in the past is that you don\u0026rsquo;t\nneed one policy if you think about it, right, you need ten, 5100, 200\nversions of that policy because you need that policy adapted to that team,\nto that environment, to that situation. See that\u0026rsquo;s the important thing and\nthat\u0026rsquo;s where we always failed because there was no way around it because\nyou either had a policy that was small, effective, easy to understand, but\nnot specific. Or you had crazy specificity to cover all the edge cases, but\nthen nobody could consume it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 44:55\nYeah, but that\u0026rsquo;s why if you do specific, you should never put it in a policy. I\nthink that\u0026rsquo;s why you need to have sort of a governance structure. You have\na policy that\u0026rsquo;s very non specific. Your policy shouldn\u0026rsquo;t change over number\nof years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 45:06\nI agree. Well, yes or no, right? Yes, the top one shouldn\u0026rsquo;t. But you need to\ntranslate what that policy means to that team, if you think about it. So\nthat means you need a custom version of a policy for a team, for a culture,\nfor an environment, even for a language that they speak, in fact, even not\njust speaking language, for particular languages. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 45:28\nYeah, but that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m saying then I don\u0026rsquo;t think it sits within the\nprogramming language. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s standard, whether it\u0026rsquo;s guideline. The\noverarching policy should be highly generic because you never put say, oh,\nwe use AES 256 in a policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 45:41\nYeah, but then is to connect down. Right. So again, if you look at the\npolicy says you should use encryption, they say on here, union needs to\ntranslate that policy to say, for example, if you use this framework, the\npolicy will say implement, use native encryption functions, that\u0026rsquo;s it or\nothers use this particular framework. Others, you have to write your own\ngood luck. Right. Or anything you do here needs to be code review. Right,\nbut that\u0026rsquo;s, I think where it failed all this because we didn\u0026rsquo;t have the\nmanpower to create that translation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 46:14\nSo I think this goes generally to development and not specifically to\nsecurity. And this is why we see a lot of backstage and developers portals\nis now a big things because it\u0026rsquo;s hard to maintain all of that framework\nkind of changes across multiple teams and security needs to be part of this\nadoption of developers and suite. I know that there are efforts to do add\nall of the security that currently is available to as plugins for those\nplatforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 47:02\nRight. Guys, we almost of the hour last minute. Any final thoughts?\nMario? Michael omer. Any final comments?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 47:10\nI think we kind of discussed a lot of things within shifting right. I think the\nkey goal in shifting right and understanding monitoring in response of it is\nhaving the visibility into your assets and having visibility into the\nmonitoring because obviously you can\u0026rsquo;t respond to something that you\ncan\u0026rsquo;t see. And then we discussed building muscle memory and practicing\nscenarios to understand the root cause and look at the incidents\ndownstream and continually reengineering your playbooks to inform the\nfuture paths and future succession is key into our sort of environment. So I\nguess that\u0026rsquo;s sort of the main things that we should take forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 48:10\nYeah, I\u0026rsquo;d say that generally the entire industry of application security has\nto do a lot and to come up with some better tooling to allow a lot of the\ntestament that we want, but that we want to have to issues that we find\nfrom right to left, wherever. But when we come to the entire part of\nsecurity grown in shift left and can attribute a lot of information, but it\u0026rsquo;s\nnow lacking the kind of right context for that information that we should\nget from shift right. And also that everything needs to be treated as a\nwhole. So you have to understand how any incident, you can\u0026rsquo;t just resolve\nit. You need to go back and understand how it relates to practices, how it\nrelates to current tooling. It\u0026rsquo;s not just something to fix and forget and you\nshould leverage it wherever you can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 49:20\nMy point is that I do that during incident because it\u0026rsquo;s when there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of\nenergy on it. And I feel that my last thought for me is that I think Gen AI is\ngoing to allow us to connect those dots in a way that before was just\nimpossible. Allow us to create context of context all verified by humans, of\ncourse, but allow us to have a scalability level that we can never before.\nGreat, guys. Well, this went really fast. It\u0026rsquo;s really cool. Okay, another topic\nand I see you guys in the next sessions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 49:48\nYes, see you.

Hi. Welcome to this open security summit session in October 2023.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m here with Chen, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to be talking about, I think, a\nmassive topic in our industry, which is basically how you address\ncybersecurity talent gap and fundamentally the growing skill shortages\nthat we I think we all feel. Anybody who\u0026rsquo;s hiring and is building teams\nexperience this. So you want to just kick us off, Chen, and give\nintroduction about you and then your views on this topic?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 00:33\nYeah. So. Hello, everybody. I\u0026rsquo;m Chen. Coming from many years in hands\non application security, I\u0026rsquo;ve been consultant through, say, the first half of\nmy career. A lot of pen testing, been around many places and so I kind of\nstruggle with the problem. I must say that by the time I was a consultant,\nnot many companies were directly employing cybersecurity professionals.\nIt just started, it was mostly consultants at the beginning and then slowly\nbut surely, companies realized that they need to build their own internal\ntask force. And it was fascinating to see how the industry responded to the\ncybersecurity threat by building internal capabilities and internal teams\nand developing methodologies. The second half of my career I was still in\ncybersecurity, but more on the Venzo side. So building products, including\nmy startup, was recently acquired by Sneak and Enzo Security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 01:43\nThis was the first ASPM solution on the planet and just a few months back\nwe got acquired by Sneak. And there I was, responsible for many different\nthings, but essentially building up a platform that will help companies\nmanage and run their application security gig, which I think is one of the\nareas where the expertise needed are so delicate and the frameworks and\nmethodologies and structure around the problem space are so\nproliferated, where this actually become a very big issue. So, yeah, I think\nmaybe this group is small enough that we can open up everybody\u0026rsquo;s access\nto microphone and then we can have it as a discussion because otherwise\nit would be just the two of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 02:41\nYeah, absolutely. I\u0026rsquo;m making everybody a co host. Right. So if you guys\nfeel free to chip in with your views and talk about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 02:52\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 02:52\nI think this is a really key thing. One topic maybe first to explore, maybe a\nlittle bit not controversial, but I would say I don\u0026rsquo;t think we have in a total\na skill shortage. I think we have a skills transfer problem. I think what\nwe\u0026rsquo;re not very good at is creating opportunities and creating recruitment\nworkflows that allows individuals and talent from other industries outside\ncybersecurity, from either technology or engineering or even left fields,\nfrom medicine, from poetry, from all sorts of different ways of life, right.\nAnd professionals to bring them into the cybersecurity field, because I\nactually feel that will increase the diversity of what we have, but I think it\nwill bring a lot of experienced professionals in our field that also really\nneeds them. So it\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily that our pool is quite small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 03:51\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like maybe we should have a bigger pool of talent to draw from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 03:57\nFor me, when I think about this subject, I think that there are a few things\nto recognize. First is that the entire information technology industry is\nquite new. When you compare it to other industries, then even when you\nthink about other industries that are similar in nature to what we are\ndoing, which is actually building things and you look at other industries\nthat are about creating products and building products, you\u0026rsquo;d see that\nthere is always different levels of professionality. You\u0026rsquo;d look at one shop\nand they\u0026rsquo;ll be building in a very chaotic way. And then you look at another\nshop and they will be building very accurately with planning and designs.\nSo the industry by itself is young. Building software, building applications,\nbuilding digital systems is very difficult. There isn\u0026rsquo;t yet a perfect way to do\nthis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 04:59\nEverybody struggles with leading an effective operation of building\nsoftware. It includes a lot of talent, a lot of different aspects that you need\nto consider when you\u0026rsquo;re working on this. And then in this industry, this\nkind of bad boy, which is cybersecurity, is even younger than the industry\nitself. And he\u0026rsquo;s trying to deliver something that requires first\nunderstanding all lot of information about building information\ntechnologies and then understanding where it can go wrong and also\nproviding a practical solution for securing it. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot to know, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of\nknowledge, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot to take in and it\u0026rsquo;s a lot to deliver to. And in this, we\nstill haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out what would be the right way, what is the right\nmethodology, what are the actual things that we need to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 06:02\nSo, for example, one of the things we\u0026rsquo;ve been focusing when we build\nEnzo security was the specific topic of how do we build up a very\nprofessional approach to the problem space? How do we try to eliminate\nthe cry wolf situation where many cybersecurity professionals think that\nit\u0026rsquo;s their job to just raise the alarm, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t really? It\u0026rsquo;s also to build up\ninto the culture of the organization, the sense of right prioritization and\nright investment in security. So it\u0026rsquo;s a lot. And because this is a lot I get\nback to what you just said. Because this is so much. There are many ways\nin which we can open up and bring in more talent and more approaches to\nthe problem and try to enable more people in assisting in making\ncompanies more resilient to cyber threats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 07:03\nYeah, if you look at, I would say, the qualities that you want in your\nprofessionals is curiosity, ability to learn, ability to handle pressure, ability\nto be a good team player, have a great cultural fit, ability to process lots\nof complex information, be able to get things done and understand\ncomplexity so you can get on right. And a lot of those are I would say\nhuman and professional skills that have nothing to do with cybersecurity,\nright? And yes, it\u0026rsquo;s a lot in our field, but you could argue that it\u0026rsquo;s also a lot\nin the medical field, it\u0026rsquo;s also a lot in other industries, right? Almost every\nindustry has a lot going on, right, in a lot of the stuff they do. So the\nchallenge there is, how do we give them those skills, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 07:52\nHow do we give skills to that individual that is joining an industry that\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t have a huge background? And I think there\u0026rsquo;s different paths. I\nthink there\u0026rsquo;s a path where you\u0026rsquo;re very technological and I think there\u0026rsquo;s a\nconnection there, but there\u0026rsquo;s also, I think, a path where you might not be\nvery technological, but you have a lot of engineering in a wider sense of\nengineering sense, or a lot of structure or ability to consume a lot of\ninformation sense. And I think each of those pillars require different\nattitudes or different approaches for how you expose that individual to an\nindustry, which, like you said, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of stuff going on. But we also\ninvent the wheel a lot, right? We also sometimes overdramatize a lot of\nthese things in our industry because it\u0026rsquo;s about the fundamentals, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 08:39\nIt\u0026rsquo;s about figuring out what you want to do, how you want to do it, how\nyou get it done, and enabling others. Because a lot of times in security, we\nare a property of a system, right? We need to get the dev team or we need\nto work with the dev team to implement certain things. We need to work\nwith engineering team to implement certain things. A lot of times we\nshouldn\u0026rsquo;t be doing it, we should be empowering, enabling, providing\nguidance, providing information, or managing risk, et cetera, for other\nteams to be productive. So a lot of those skills you can learn. So a lot of\nthose specific technicalities things you can learn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 09:15\nI think my hypothesis is the other skill set is much harder to learn and the\ntalent pool that we go for these days is much smaller, which a lot of times\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t have those skills of. Basically. For example, I was talking to a\nfriend of mine and his wife, he\u0026rsquo;s a teacher, right? And I think teachers are\namazing, right? I think teachers anybody who can teach a bunch of kids,\nright, fucking it\u0026rsquo;s a hell of a skill, right? And if you talk about managing\nand keeping that in control and dealing with all the stuff and now there\u0026rsquo;s\na lot of complexities in UK about it, but those individuals are amazing,\nright? But they\u0026rsquo;re actually not very well paid in a weird way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 09:56\nWe have a premium in cybersecurity that we should be leveraging because\nit\u0026rsquo;s almost like we need people to do transfer from one industry and\nactually we can pay them more even to where they are, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave domain expertise. Because at the moment, the premium is actually\nreally high. And you can argue that for the skill that the new generation\nhas, that premium is out of whack. It just happens to be a lot of demand.\nLike you said when you started, when I was around initially there was no\ncybersecurity teams, right. The market for cybersecurity professionals was\nmuch lower to be hired as a threat modeler. What the hell? That wasn\u0026rsquo;t\nthe thing. Right? And now a full blown career path, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 10:40\nYeah, I think they\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to build in some universities, they\u0026rsquo;re\nalready trying to build. They\u0026rsquo;ve been existing also for a while, full training\nprograms and full education programs around the subject. But I think one\nof the challenging things here is that this subject is so much about other\ntopics. It\u0026rsquo;s not so much a thing by itself is just to properly understand\ninformation technologies and then try to find ways to inject some security\nin them. If it\u0026rsquo;s in the understanding the infrastructure and then from\nunderstanding the infrastructure you can understand potential threats and\nrisks and then you need to understand how to deliver solutions to this. So\nyou have a long way to go. But I think that similar to how I spend a lot of\nmy time in a lot of my career in companies that build information\ntechnology project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 11:45\nSo I live and breathe the DNA of companies that are building software.\nAnd as you spend more and more time there at the beginning, you think\nit\u0026rsquo;s just a bunch of developers behind the keyboard. At some point you\nstart to realize that there are also product people and operation people.\nWhy would you need an operation person in a company that all they do is\nbuild up software but you actually really need those operation people\nbecause coordinating between the different efforts of the company is super\ncritical. Why do we need so much investment in product definition?\nBecause if you don\u0026rsquo;t invest properly in product definition, you will have\nyour developers running about trying to build stuff that won\u0026rsquo;t connect and\nwon\u0026rsquo;t deliver to the actual needs of the user eventually. So you need to\nactually invest more in product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 12:33\nAnd then you even have things like marketing and people that are just\nexplaining what this should be explaining to the outside world, what this\nshould be to building up brand and marketing around it. And as you spend\nmore and more time in high tech and you realize how many different\nprofessions are there in high tech, you can open up to the notion that it\u0026rsquo;s\nnot necessarily about the technicality of things like you said before. It\u0026rsquo;s\nmore about and especially in cybersecurity, it\u0026rsquo;s more about mindshare,\nmind, share of the organization. The successful cybersecurity professional\nis the one that managed to convince as many different people in the\norganization that this is important. They don\u0026rsquo;t even need to understand\nthe single expert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 13:24\nThey just need to understand that eventually bringing security to a\ncompany is just changing the mindset of the people and making them\naware of the problem eventually. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how good of a pen tester\nyou are. If the developers don\u0026rsquo;t think so, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. You have to\nconvince them eventually. You have to convince their managers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 13:49\nTo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 13:50\nGive you the budget and to put efforts into securing. And when you think\nabout this, like you said before, it opens up a lot of opportunities to loop in\nmore people, loop in operation people, loop in product people, loop in\nmarketing people. Marketing is super important for cybersecurity,\nintelligent marketing, promoting the notion that we need to be more\ncareful with how we do things. You can just put a marketing person on\nthat job, just feed to them professionally with the right messaging, the\nmessaging that will be useful for developers and then they will be probably\nmore impactful than the best pen tester on the long term.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 14:35\nNo, I agree. And I think the interesting challenge now is how can we\ncreate jobs and help people in those transitions? Because the ones who are\nhiring have in a way of responsibility to create jobs that allow those\nindividuals to make the jump. One of the things I try to do these days a lot\nis to do internal seconds. So try to find other individuals in the company\nthat want to join a cybersecurity team, even just for a little bit, and then\nthat allows that transition to be smoother and that allows us to say, hey,\nwe got this project here that would be great if you can help. So that makes\na big difference. So Anthony has a good question here, which is what are\nthe good instructional schools and education we can obtain?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 15:20\nMy main thing on this is like a I think in security you need to learn how to\nhack. I think it\u0026rsquo;s very important. I think there\u0026rsquo;s something when you\nexploit that, you understand a lot better what happens in here. And I think\na lot of the it\u0026rsquo;s all about hands on experience, it\u0026rsquo;s about having practical\nunderstanding and doing some of these things for real. And for example,\nopen source communities are great because they need a lot of help and\nthey\u0026rsquo;re always quite friendly. And I have to say, these days I would say\nstart with Chat GBT, start with Bard. But I think Chat GBT is still\nprobably the best one on this level and the next generation of education\nbots are going to make a massive difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 15:57\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk a little bit in the session, I\u0026rsquo;m going to work in a bit,\nbut I think that is going to be a massive change because Anthony, for\nexample, you will be able to create personalized training for you or for\nwhoever you know, that needs this, right? And that is super powerful\nbecause you can say, here\u0026rsquo;s the objectives, here\u0026rsquo;s the topics, here\u0026rsquo;s the\nconcepts, here\u0026rsquo;s the things we want to cover, and now here\u0026rsquo;s your\nexperience, here\u0026rsquo;s what you know, this is the areas you\u0026rsquo;re good at, the\nareas you have good references. How do we now create a learning path, a\nset of explanations, a set of knowledge that is completely customized to\nthe individual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 16:37\nAnd I think that\u0026rsquo;s a game changer because it allows somebody who\nalready has a lot of domain expertise to realize that those acquired skills\nare actually not that far off from the more advanced cybersecurity skills\nwhich might look very Chinese in the beginning, but actually they\u0026rsquo;re just\nvariations of things that you probably already know. You just call them\ndifferent things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 17:00\nI think that one thing that is kind of shared between all cybersecurity\nprofessionals is that they promote thinking out of the box and trying to\nthink outside of the box. And then when you think about the title of this\nsession, how do we address the gap in cybersecurity? It could be\nimmediately our first response to think out of the box and the out of the\nbox here would be to try and find different ways of reaping value from\npeople that are interested in people are interested in. And if Anthony, if\nyou\u0026rsquo;re interested, like exactly like Denny said, go about the thing that you\nknow, what brings you into the It industry? Obviously not the all of\ncybersecurity is about the It industry. There are big parts of any industry\nbecause every industry have it today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 17:52\nBut I would speak from it industry perspective because this is what I know\nbest. Think about all the profession that exists there in the It industry and\nthen if you\u0026rsquo;re focusing, if you\u0026rsquo;re already in this industry, you already have\na profession in this industry. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;re a product manager, maybe\nyou\u0026rsquo;re a developer, maybe you are in marketing, maybe you are in sales. If\nyou\u0026rsquo;re already in this industry, try to find what would be the closest angle.\nOf course you can go about formal training, like the list that you shared in\nChat. What kind of training and certifications? Recommended ones. I\npersonally, I admit I have none of these. I don\u0026rsquo;t have CISSP, I have none of\nthese and I\u0026rsquo;ve been delivering security in many different organizations for\na very long time now. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any formal education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 18:58\nThis is definitely a route that you can take to try and onboard one\nprogram. I\u0026rsquo;d say go start with Udemy, start with acquiring knowledge\nbefore trying to go for a certification. Maybe try and play around with bug\nbounty programs. They\u0026rsquo;re open. You can maybe try and bank over a\nspecific issue like corset scripting for example. Try to learn it, go to\nUdemy, go to YouTube, learn about corset scripting and then go to bug\nbounty programs and try to find one. And try to find corset scripting by\nyourself. This will really create some appetite for more because if you find\none, you could actually get paid for it. And I\u0026rsquo;ve seen people start their\ncareer this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 19:45\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen people very successful today start and accelerated their career\nthis way by just learning about few classes of inabilities one by one and\nthen trying to find themselves. There are a lot of available resources to try\nyourself, like look for vulnerable web applications. In Google, there are a\nbunch of applications that can be used to try out, right? Yeah. Juice shop,\nfor example. Use juice shop and similar applications to try out and\nexperience yourself what it is to exploit applications. And then from there\ntake it to bug bounty programs and try in the real world, if your vector is\ntechnical, if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in trying out exploits, trying out, finding\nvulnerabilities, this is definitely a way to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 20:44\nIn the past, I was a lot more dismissive of certifications. I think it depends\nwhere you are, and I think it depends on the path that you have available\nto you. There\u0026rsquo;s definitely places in the world that certification is a big\ndeal. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m on that world. I don\u0026rsquo;t think when we hire, that\u0026rsquo;s\ndefinitely not what we look for. We would never say, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the\ncertifications, you\u0026rsquo;re not applicable for the job, right? Actually, I would\neven argue that whoever does that, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to work for them\nbecause they\u0026rsquo;re already looking at the wrong thing. That said, there is\nvalue. If you like to study, if you\u0026rsquo;re good at exams, that\u0026rsquo;s a way to learn,\ngo for it, right? But I don\u0026rsquo;t think you should view it as the primary, most\nimportant thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 21:29\nIf you get those compton ISC square, et cetera, it\u0026rsquo;s not how you get those.\nYou get a job. Right. That\u0026rsquo;s not how it works. And I don\u0026rsquo;t think that\u0026rsquo;s the\nbest way to learn. I think, again, some individuals care about it. I actually\nreally like the idea of starting to create customized, again, versions of that\nbased on what matters. Because the problem with a lot of those\ncertifications is that only 10% of it is interesting, right. The other is just\nfluff, or the other is not relevant, or basically it\u0026rsquo;s, okay, well, persuade\n10% could be relevant to some things, right? But where you want to go or\nwhat your skill set is not that good. Now, you mentioned also boot camps.\nNow, these are interesting, and I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some really good ones. I\u0026rsquo;m sure\nthere\u0026rsquo;s really bad ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:14\nBut the boot camps have an interesting concept, at least the ones I\u0026rsquo;ve\nseen, which is they take cohorts of individuals who have a lot of\nexperience, but for example, don\u0026rsquo;t have security experience, or don\u0026rsquo;t have\ntechnology experience, or don\u0026rsquo;t have development experience. And like, for\nexample, I would absolutely hire somebody who did a developer boot\ncamp, right? I think that\u0026rsquo;s a great thing because I think development is a\nreally hard skill and somebody who\u0026rsquo;s gone through it and understood and\nknows version control and knows a lot of those things, that\u0026rsquo;s actually\nquite a really great skill. That is highly applicable. Yes, there\u0026rsquo;s probably a\nmoney grab there situation that you\u0026rsquo;re talking about. I think you need to\nbe careful. Again, there\u0026rsquo;s probably a lot of lemons in the market these\ndays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:59\nI would look at what\u0026rsquo;s the output, what did the people that took the\ncourse, the boot camp did but some of them are quite good because it\u0026rsquo;s a\nthree months intensive thing or six months or whatever it is and it\u0026rsquo;s almost\ndriven by the market. So a lot of those actually give very highly\nemployable skills and it\u0026rsquo;s all about the attitude, it\u0026rsquo;s all about how you\napproach it. So I think you be careful and again you could spend a lot of\nmoney right and not advance a lot, right? I think there\u0026rsquo;s lots of ways you\ncan start straight away to learn that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require to spend a lot of\nmoney on courses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 23:39\nYeah, I think that if you think about the subject of this talk I think maybe I\nrecognize now that the content for an individual is trying to enter the\ncybersecurity market and try to become to work there is different than if\nyou talk to a company who\u0026rsquo;s trying to bridge their gap in recruiting people\nis completely different. And I think that if we have captured here\nsomething in it together and I think that for the latter, for the companies\nthat are trying to find out how they can onboard more professionals open\nup, think out of the box and try to find ways to enable people contribute to\ncybersecurity from different angles. Because actually there are many\nangles that have been neglected. There marketing I think is one of them.\nInternal marketing, promoting the message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 24:32\nIf you look at even security frameworks, they would deduct a very big part\nof the framework would be about publishing the data and the knowledge\ninside of an organization. And this doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to do anything with\nknowing, with actually understanding cybersecurity, it\u0026rsquo;s just understanding\nmessaging and how to talk about it. If you are an individual, I think that a\ngood thing to do would be to look at yourself and how you\u0026rsquo;re usually\ninterested in learning things and acquiring new skills and new knowledge\nand apply the same thing to this process. There is no right or wrong way\nto do this, there is just opportunities all over the place. Many of them are\nfree. I don\u0026rsquo;t think you should start with something that you pay for and\nthen just embark on a journey. But please understand it will be a journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 25:28\nIt will take years until you\u0026rsquo;d get to a level of people that have been doing\nthis for a long time. But you could acquire a lot of knowledge quite\nquickly if you use what\u0026rsquo;s out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 25:41\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the thing, right, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to do this for a little while.\nThe fundamental requirement is you need to start to have an interest\npassion, because some people show passion different ways but you need to\nbe maybe fascinated is a more better word. You need to fall in love with\ncybersecurity, right? Because I think the nice thing of our industry is most\nof the professionals, they absolutely love it. There\u0026rsquo;s a passion about it,\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a genuine sparkle in the eyes that you see in our profession, which\nis great, by the way. I think it\u0026rsquo;s one of the great things of our industry. And\nI also feel that there is an interesting situation because cybersecurity is\nquite a glamorous in one way career path. A lot of people talk about it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s good media promotion and then there\u0026rsquo;s good salaries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 26:30\nI do see people trying to cross that for the wrong reasons. And although I\ndo believe that if you do the right path, you will earn more, your career is\nprobably better path to have a higher income. And not that should be the\ngoal, but again, there\u0026rsquo;s a path there. Doing that for those reasons is\nwrong. I do feel that it\u0026rsquo;s a great career, probably not for everybody, but\nit\u0026rsquo;s a really cool thing. And that\u0026rsquo;s the feel that it\u0026rsquo;s almost like individuals, I\nwant to get into cybersecurity. They need to find the sweet spot, they need\nto find the area. And cybersecurity is massive. It\u0026rsquo;s fucking huge in terms of\nareas that they can really relate to. And more important, they can go, oh, I\ncould do that better. Marketing is a good example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 27:13\nA marketing executive can look at how we communicate and go, and you\nguys have no freaking idea, right? This is a shit show, right? I can do\nbetter. I might not understand cybersecurity, but I know how to\ncommunicate, right? He says Response somebody might go, this is a shit\nshow. The way you handle incidents. If we did that in a hospital, half our\npatients would die, right? So I think there\u0026rsquo;s also areas engineering. Give\nme an area. I can find an example in cybersecurity that you can probably\nadd value. And the good news is that we\u0026rsquo;re not a mature industry. The\ngood news is because the market keeps evolving, because the threats keep\nevolving, because technology keeps evolving, and now we got the whole\nGPT and AI world, which is another massive area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 27:55\nThe good news is you can still hack your way into the industry, like you\ncould still do what we did. I would argue that we hacked our way into the\nindustry. We didn\u0026rsquo;t had a lot of formal stuff. We just stumbled across,\nbecame good, gained reputation, got hired and it went from there. So it\u0026rsquo;s\nstill a good moment to join the industry and I think we need a lot of new\nblood and new ideas and new experiences. And it could be a work from\nhome mom, right? It could be somebody who\u0026rsquo;s joined a bunch of other\nstuff who wants to join. Or it could be somebody who wants to go the next\nlevel of their career. I think there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of really cool opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 28:28\nAgreed. I think that it\u0026rsquo;s actually a very good timing because the evolution\nof this is due. It\u0026rsquo;s really required now that I think the same as information\ntechnology is now maturing to a level where people have been shouting,\nagile, do this, do that. But now it\u0026rsquo;s already been through, I\u0026rsquo;d say, second\nphase of evolution where people realize that even agile is not just a magic\nsolution and you need to have more. And the different professions inside\ninformation technologies industry are evolving to become something much\nmore professional. Like, if you compare agriculture or other industries\nthat have been there for a very long time, you see the level of knowledge\nand professionality that the humankind have around these is much more\nmature than what we have information technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 29:29\nPut us to shame every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 29:31\nYeah, it\u0026rsquo;s amazing to see and it\u0026rsquo;s amazing to realize this. And then if you\nthink about cybersecurity, it\u0026rsquo;s even behind it\u0026rsquo;s playing catch. And this is a\nreally good timing because as we can all see, it\u0026rsquo;s really, truly necessary\nthat people will get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 29:47\nThe stuff figured out and the exacts pay attention. Right. Like,\ncybersecurity is a top level risk for a company. It\u0026rsquo;s not a low risk. And to\nbe honest, we get this wrong, our customers suffer. Right. Our financing\ncompany suffers. Right. Or whatever you\u0026rsquo;re trying to protect. So it\u0026rsquo;s a real\nthing. Right. I like the fact that I make my customers safe. We make a\ndifference by keeping their data, their assets, their experience, the trust.\nWe protect it. So I think it\u0026rsquo;s a really cool career, right. And it\u0026rsquo;s always\nlearning. There\u0026rsquo;s always new stuff, there\u0026rsquo;s always new things to learn. And\nthe thing that Anthony, you just said I think is interesting is to say the path\nis hard to figure out where you can land. I would challenge that a little bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 30:35\nI think you need to find a path that you are already going and then do a\nTweak on it, on security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 30:43\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 30:44\nLike, whatever career you\u0026rsquo;re in, you\u0026rsquo;re already in a career path, even if\nyou\u0026rsquo;re learning it, if you\u0026rsquo;re a student, doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. There\u0026rsquo;s already\nthings that you love to do or you think you have a certain seller skill set.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where you want to align yourself. Right. You want to align yourself\nwith that. So I think sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s easy to overbake this, easy to say, well,\nI should go there. No, a lot of this is just try to do it, try to protect\nyourself, try to protect your family, try to look wherever you are. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t\nmatter if you\u0026rsquo;re a student or a professional work for a company. There will\nbe a cybersecurity team that you can touch, that you can go in there and\nsay, hey, I want to be a security champion. I want to help out, I want to be\ninvolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 31:23\nWhat can I do? Right? And open. Source projects. Like just volunteer,\nright? Hack your way into the project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 31:30\nYeah, exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 31:31\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the best way to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 31:33\nYeah. One of the key tenants here is think out of the box. Hack your way.\nHack your way into it. I think this would be the best if we\u0026rsquo;re talking about\npeople trying to get in. Hack your way in. No rules. The only rule about it,\nthere is no rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 31:48\nYeah. That\u0026rsquo;s how most of us do it, right? Always be on the good side of the\nforce, by the way. Always be at the coach. Never do anything for personal\ngain at that level. But apart from that, right? It\u0026rsquo;s like, be out there and\nfind that path. And the gen AI stuff is massive because for the first time,\nyou can create a prompt that says, I do this to my friends. I write prompts\nwhere I say, I\u0026rsquo;m this person. I have this experience. I have this and this.\nWhat should I do? Actually, let me literally read you this, right? A friend of\nmine is a PE teacher. Literally I literally wrote this. Let me just find it.\nWhich I think was a really good way to what\u0026rsquo;s it called? Yeah. There you\ngo. Look. See, I literally wrote this, right? I\u0026rsquo;m X name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:47\nI\u0026rsquo;m a teacher. I\u0026rsquo;m just reading, really, the prompt I created right when I\nwas with him, right in the car. I\u0026rsquo;m a teacher in London, has ten years\nexperience. I\u0026rsquo;m good with managing people. He wrote this. He wrote the\nfirst part of it. He says, I\u0026rsquo;m a teacher in London, has ten years of\nexperience. I\u0026rsquo;m good with managing people, and I\u0026rsquo;m good at listening,\nproblem solving and resolving conflict. I love football. I\u0026rsquo;m a really good\nteam player, have strong ethics and values. I believe in happy and\nproductive teams. I had enough of my job. I\u0026rsquo;m frustrated with my current\ncareer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 33:16\nSend over the CV, please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:18\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m frustrated with my current job. I am looking for a career change.\nAnd what are good options for me, right? I literally typed it. And then\nagain, what are good jobs for me in cybersecurity, right? And then Chat\nGPT answered, hey, with your background in teaching, manage complex\npeople in conflict resolution, coupled with a strong ethics and team play\nattitude, you are positioned to transition to cybersecurity. Here\u0026rsquo;s a step for\nyou. Education and certification. Leverage your skills. Cybersecurity\nAwareness and Training incident Response Team. Do some networking,\nget some soft skills, blah, blah. Start small, stay updated, tell your CV and\nthat\u0026rsquo;s it. So, literally, at this level. And then Chat GPT is cool because you\ncan go, okay, can you zoom in on this? Can you give me a five action plan?\nCan you give me a three week schedule?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 34:04\nJust learn how to use it. In fact, Chat GPT at the moment, llams is a great\nway to enter the industry. Because I\u0026rsquo;m telling you, half our industry\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t have a freaking clue. That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m going to speak next, right?\nLiterally, they don\u0026rsquo;t have a clue and they totally deers in headlights. So if\nyou even become half proficient in Chat GBT, you can use Chat GPT to get\nyou the job. And you should be hired just because of those skills. The same\nway that people ten years ago were hired because they knew the internet,\nlike, hey, they want to hire a designer. We have ten designers. They\u0026rsquo;re all\npretty good. You know the internet, there you go, we hire you. That was it,\nright? And so those are the opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 34:44\nI think that Denzel and I were roughly the same age from that. I know\nthat we got our way into this industry, like you said before, by hacking our\nway through. So I think this would be our most Jupiter recommendation.\nHack your way through what was just suggested here. Use Jet GPT to help\nyou find your personal ending point. I think it\u0026rsquo;s fascinating. It\u0026rsquo;s really cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 35:13\nAnd look, by the way, hack just from a historical point of view is actually a\ngood thing, right? Like hacking, you know, was taken by the media. But\nhack is finding a problem. Hacking is MacGyver, right? For the ones it\u0026rsquo;s\nbasically when you have a problem and you find a solution and you put it\ntogether and you find a way to get it done. That was actually what\u0026rsquo;s called\na hack in the early days. And that\u0026rsquo;s what we would do in websites.\nSomebody would put a website, put an application for a network, and we\nwill find ways to do things that were not supposed to be used like that. But\nwe\u0026rsquo;re like, hey, guess what, it\u0026rsquo;s possible. And here\u0026rsquo;s the problem, here\u0026rsquo;s the\nimplication. You just immediate that make it bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 35:50\nSo when we say hack your way into it is finding that it\u0026rsquo;s problem solving,\nis figuring out how to go to the next step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 35:58\nI think that it is worth mentioning that in order to be really proficient, and\nespecially if you want to choose the engineering journey, the technical\njourney, you need to learn a lot and you need to learn a lot about\ninformation technologies, about computers, about how software works.\nI\u0026rsquo;d say it\u0026rsquo;s not so easy, but you have to start somewhere. So I\u0026rsquo;d\nrecommend, if you\u0026rsquo;re inclined to do the engineering path, the technical\npath I\u0026rsquo;d recommend, learn about communication, computer\ncommunication. Learn a little bit of coding with publicly available\nresources. Try to create your own first web application using React.\nMaybe go and try to follow step by step creating a React app today, it\u0026rsquo;s\nquite easy. Setting up dependencies is quite easy. You\u0026rsquo;d start with\nsomething like a vite application. Vite. Try to go over the first step\ninstructions on how to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 37:08\nGet yourself familiar with how technology work, how computer\ncommunication work. You won\u0026rsquo;t figure out everything in the first week or\neven months, but the more you learn about it will create an appetite for\nlearning more. And then if you go with things like juice shop or other\ntraining applications, we combine these two, the growing knowledge\naround information technologies and software development, with the\nappetite to try and break them and try to find loopholes and hack them. I\nthink this would set you up on a path, if technical path is what you are\nlooking for. But like you said, there are many other ways to get there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:50\nBut the key I think you touch is you need to learn, right? And let\u0026rsquo;s be clear,\nright? If you\u0026rsquo;re trying to get an industry, you have a handicap. Let\u0026rsquo;s just be\nvery transparent. You are competing with individuals that industry have\nmore experience. I would argue that if you come with a whole bag of other\nexperiences, you have a competitive advantage against those individuals\nbecause you have a wider pool of talent and pool experiences, again, to\nbring not cybersecurity, but others. But you need to learn, right? There is\nno shortcut here. In a way, the learning, if you don\u0026rsquo;t like to learn, then\nthat\u0026rsquo;s a problem. But if you love to learn or if you enjoy learning, then it\u0026rsquo;s\na good thing, right? I think that makes a big difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:28\nAnd also in terms of where to start, look, the Open Security Summit, in a\nway, if you think about it, with the speakers that you have here, with the\ncommunity, with the people involved, there\u0026rsquo;s enough employers, right, to\nhire a lot of people. But what I sometimes find fascinating is that why\naren\u0026rsquo;t a new generation a lot more involved? Like the Open Security\nSummit needs a lot more volunteers, needs a lot of people to help. There\u0026rsquo;s\na lot of stuff to do. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of things that don\u0026rsquo;t happen because\nthere\u0026rsquo;s not enough time, because it\u0026rsquo;s all like volunteer driven, right?\nIncluding my time. Right? So open source is a great way to be involved.\nCommunities like this, communities like Oasp, right? They\u0026rsquo;re amazing\ncommunities. And guess what? You can be hired through you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:08\nIf you involve and you help somebody, they\u0026rsquo;re going to go, oh, I have an\nopportunity for you. And then it\u0026rsquo;s a personal recommendation. And that\nmakes the whole difference because it\u0026rsquo;s suddenly like there\u0026rsquo;s somebody\nwho\u0026rsquo;s more emotional connected to helping you, and they might give you\ngood guidance, good mentoring, and a lot of those individuals are there.\nBut you guys need to do the first job jump, which is be involved, help\nfigure out where you can add value and try it out. The worst thing that\ncan happen, you ignored that\u0026rsquo;s. All right? At least you learn something. So\nthat\u0026rsquo;s the thing, right? And we failed a lot. We always try these things. And\nas long as you try and you learn and you recent repeat, eventually you find\nyour sweet spot and also work with people that you have the same values,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:53\nThere\u0026rsquo;s lots of good people in cybersecurity. There\u0026rsquo;s lots of bad people in\ncybersecurity. There\u0026rsquo;s lots of people doing cybersecurity for the wrong\nreasons. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of people on areas of cybersecurity that have\nquestionable ethics don\u0026rsquo;t need to go to those. Right. There\u0026rsquo;s others who\nare doing great stuff, work for great companies, or doing some great\nthings. Right. So it\u0026rsquo;s quite big. Right. So align with your ethics, with what\nyou want to do, how you want to learn, and then take you from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 40:16\nAbsolutely. Everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 40:19\nCool. All right, man. I think we\u0026rsquo;re just wrapping up. Any final words from\nyou?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 40:26\nNo, I think we\u0026rsquo;ve said it all. Especially I think I agreed a lot with what\nDenise said. Get connected with your own, with what you\u0026rsquo;re good at. Try\nto use this as your penetration vector. To get in it. You have to learn. You\u0026rsquo;ll\nhave to learn some things. I personally recommend try to take in a lot of\ninformation about information technology. Or you could also think of it as\na completely different thing. If you\u0026rsquo;re not taking the technical and\nengineering journey, there are many options in I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t jump straight to\npay for education. Education is available for free. For your first steps, you\nshould definitely be able to do it for free. And then when you see that\u0026rsquo;s the\nright way for you, maybe you can also think of some paid education. But\ndon\u0026rsquo;t start with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 41:23\nDalio, you\u0026rsquo;re joining in. Come on. What\u0026rsquo;s your views on this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 41:29\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t hear you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 41:30\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t hear you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 41:42\nNow. We can hear you now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 41:43\nWe can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 41:47\nYeah. I just want to thank you for the session. It\u0026rsquo;s always nice to learn\nwith you guys. I\u0026rsquo;m Deldio. I\u0026rsquo;m working now in It development. I\u0026rsquo;m\nworking as a quality assurance analyst. And I relate a lot to what Dinesh\nsaid in the beginning. My background is in biochemistry. I was a teacher\nfor roughly three years, and after a few years, I started working in It, first\nas a business analyst and later on as a tester. And, yeah, I continue the\njourney and try and hack my way into the field, but no rush. I want to be\nsure on what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. So I continue to be interested in the cybersecurity\nfield or industry, as it\u0026rsquo;s becoming an industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 42:33\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 42:34\nOr as you prefer to call it. The other day I attended Lisbon chapter\nsession, so I think I\u0026rsquo;m still trying to find out if I\u0026rsquo;m in love, if I\u0026rsquo;m really in\nlove with cybersecurity, and finding out if I\u0026rsquo;m up to the journey, basically.\nAnd today I was in the office and I managed to fit this session in my\nschedule. So I\u0026rsquo;ll continue my journey and probably I\u0026rsquo;ll try to hack my way\ninto the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 42:58\nBrilliant. I think I\u0026rsquo;m presenting in the London Lisbon chapter next month.\nI think I\u0026rsquo;m just waiting for final confirmation. So might see you be could\nbe, yeah. You are a great example of a lot of I would say, the talent that\nwe need in our industry. One of the big elephants that always been I guess\nI come from a developer background, so I guess it was a bit rich of me to\nsay this, but I always felt that if you understand development, you can\u0026rsquo;t\nreally do AppSec, right? Like, literally. And a lot of the problems we have\nin our industry is caused by even us as an industry or parts of our industry,\ndictating AbSec stuff to engineers who know 100 times more on that on\nthe other side. And it\u0026rsquo;s kind of like, dude, what the hell? Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 43:46\nYou should understand how we operate, then give me guidance. And in a\nweird way, it\u0026rsquo;s not the cybersecurity professional fault, too, because it\u0026rsquo;s\nvery skewed, right? Like, you\u0026rsquo;re telling you we\u0026rsquo;re asking for cybersecurity\nprofessionals to understand about frameworks and this and development\nand that workflow and this thing and that. The list is massive, which is\nwhy I also think that the Gen AI and the agents that are coming next will\nmake a massive difference because it allows us to communicate in a much\nbetter language so we can start to talk about the intent that we want to do\nin security. But in your world, you understand about how to deliver code.\nYou understand how to deliver effective solutions, right? Like, come on,\nman. Some of the cybersecurity teams, we\u0026rsquo;re the worst ones, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:25\nLike, if you look at some of our development practices, if you look at how\neven cybersecurity products, man, fucking out, like, some of the products,\nliterally, you think they should know better, right? But again, it\u0026rsquo;s the same\nproblem. They have a problem. They\u0026rsquo;re shipping to market. They go out\nthere by the time they\u0026rsquo;re successful, it\u0026rsquo;s lots of legacy stuff, and then they\nbecome just like the other vendors that we sometimes have problem from\na security point of view, but they just happen to do a security product. But\nI think that transition from QA to security, especially in development,\nshould not be that hard because you have a level of maturity that is\nmissing in lots of areas in the cybersecurity world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:07\nAnd I would argue that even if you just do cybersecurity for a couple of\nyears, when you go back to your maybe QA is your passion or\ndevelopment is your passion and you want to do maybe that path, you\u0026rsquo;ll\nbetter. I was a CTO for a while, and I can totally say that my definition of\nwhat\u0026rsquo;s possible was very different from the other engineers. In fact, I\nwould have to argue with other engineers about what was possible, and I\nwas like, Dude, this is your world. Why don\u0026rsquo;t you get it? Like, okay, it\u0026rsquo;s not\nhow it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be doing, but it works, right? So I found that even\nsometimes the development teams and QA teams and engineering teams\nget siloed, right? And insecure, you learn to question everything. You learn\nthe power of well, I know it was not supposed to be possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:52\nI know it was not supposed to work, but I just made it work. Right. And\nthen you understand how. So I think the curiosity is really cool in security,\nbecause we can go deep. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 46:04\nThat\u0026rsquo;s my experience as well. If you start from security, you open up a lot\nof possibilities in software development because you adapt this kind of no\nborders kind of thinking. You will always challenge the information\naround you to see to find loopholes, and it opened up a good position for\ncontinuing your career in engineering everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:29\nExactly. Cool. All right, guys, thanks for participating. We\u0026rsquo;ll share the\nvideo, and I really want to figure out how to use Nargen AI to really\naugment some of these topics, because I think we have a lot of great\ncontent already on a particular summit, but it kind of gets lost. So I think\nanother we move the needle a little bit further. So, again, thanks, Jan, for\nbeing part of it and helping with this session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Gour-Arie - 46:52\nMy pleasure.

We have\nJames, who is going to talk to us about the truth about suffering a\ncybersecurity attack. I\u0026rsquo;m really looking forward to this one because I\u0026rsquo;ve\nbeen involved in several ones and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of great stuff to learn. So.\nOver to you, James.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 00:23\nCheers. Thank you very much. Thank you for joining me to talk about the\ntruth about suffering a cybersecurity attack. I think the ultimate thing that\nI want everyone to leave here with today is we\u0026rsquo;re all human. At the end of\nthe day, these things happen, but we need to learn from them. It\u0026rsquo;s not a\ncase of just taking a scenario and going, well, we\u0026rsquo;ve dealt with a problem\nand putting it behind us. We should be learning and growing from it.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s really where I\u0026rsquo;ve approached what I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk to you about\ntoday from a real world point of view. Just to give you all a bit of\nbackground about me. So I\u0026rsquo;m James Dell. I\u0026rsquo;m associate director and head\nof technical architecture at Planet It. The reason that I\u0026rsquo;m kind of here and\nI\u0026rsquo;m able to talk about this stuff is we unfortunately get pulled in after a lot\nof businesses have suffered a cyberattack and where they\u0026rsquo;re doing incident\nresponse or we\u0026rsquo;re doing threat investigation and trying to find out how\nthings have happened, ultimately put things right and get businesses back\non track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 01:16\nOften we get dragged in at the point where businesses have suffered and\nthey\u0026rsquo;re really looking for someone to be that helping hand. That\u0026rsquo;s given us\nsome great opportunity, me personally, some great opportunity to be first\nhand across some very different businesses. That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk\nto you about today, is those scenarios and where that fits. Obviously I\nwork plan it and a lot of you probably won\u0026rsquo;t know who plan it is, but\nessentially the way to look at it is we are a one stop shop for all things it.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why we come from a very strong cybersecurity background. 20\nyears in cybersecurity, but we just don\u0026rsquo;t just do that. We\u0026rsquo;re involved with\nlots of businesses ahead of that. We may be talking to them about\nhardware procurement and other things, and then an incident happens\nand they go, oh, you guys are cybersecurity experts, why don\u0026rsquo;t you come in\nas well and help us with this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 02:07\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how we get involved in a lot of these scenarios. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about\nthe scenarios today, all of these are real world scenarios, so everything I\u0026rsquo;m\ntalking about really happened. Quite obviously, we have sanitized down\nthe data, so we\u0026rsquo;re not telling you who we\u0026rsquo;re talking about, we\u0026rsquo;ll tell you\nthe sector they sit in, but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to tell you exactly who they are,\nbecause obviously they\u0026rsquo;ve done a lot of work to rebuild their brands and I\nwant to go and trash them on the internet. My kind of aims from, say, the\nkind of four main aims, is to talk about what happens when a\ncybersecurity attack is discovered. There\u0026rsquo;s a real human element behind\nthat I want to talk about and go into some great detail around that. I\u0026rsquo;m\nthen going to go through four scenarios that happened and I\u0026rsquo;m going to\ncover inside of those, the attack chain, where they went wrong as a\nbusiness, and then ultimately what the financial implication was to that\nbusiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 03:00\nOnce we\u0026rsquo;ve looked at those scenarios, I\u0026rsquo;m going to come on and start\ntalking around the lessons you can learn from those scenarios and what\nwe should be taking away from this as businesses moving forward and It\nprofessionals in general. The final thing is the kind of elephant in the\nroom, that kind of cyber insurance. What I want to talk about is what it\nreally costs, because we all know how important cyber insurance is,\nespecially in 2023. What\u0026rsquo;s the underlying principle there and what is the\nimplication of the risk? I\u0026rsquo;m going to go into some detail around that. What\nhappens when a cybersecurity attack is discovered? Well, having been,\nunfortunately, not an instant, I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about today. Firsthand,\nwhen I was an It manager in front of one of these, the first thing that\nhappens is you get overwhelmed. That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to show here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 03:50\nThe first thing is your pressure starts mounting. You there\u0026rsquo;s people looking\nat you for a lost revenue. They\u0026rsquo;re wanting to know how these mistakes\nhappened. They\u0026rsquo;re wanting you to make decisions to get the business back\non its feet as quickly as possible. They want to know if you\u0026rsquo;ve got the\nresource to do it. They want to know if the attack is over. They want to\nknow who is there to be held accountable. They want answers. They want\nto know who did it, how it happened, when it happened. None of this ever\nhappens at a convenient time as well. You\u0026rsquo;ll then be forced to put untested\nstrategies into place. For a lot of businesses, their Dr plans, their business\ncontinuity plans are untested and this is the time that they get pushed and\nyou push the button and go, right, we\u0026rsquo;re failing over to our Dr scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 04:35\nAnd does it really work? Has anyone ever used it? That loads employee\nstress. You\u0026rsquo;ve then got senior management looking at you again, well,\nwhat about the reputational damage? And you\u0026rsquo;re screaming for help\nultimately. What that really does is having been there and seen lots of It\nmanagers there through what we do at Planet it is, it causes panic and it\nreally influences decision making. You\u0026rsquo;ll see that through the scenarios\nthat I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about, that as much as we can say that we all know\nwhat we do in a scenario. We\u0026rsquo;ve got great Dr plans, we\u0026rsquo;ve got great\ncybersecurity, we\u0026rsquo;ve got a great sock team, we know the pieces of the\npuzzle, we know that we\u0026rsquo;ve got offline backups, we\u0026rsquo;ve got Immutability.\nThe truth is, when it goes wrong, the pressure really quickly ramps up and\na lot of people struggle to make clear decisions in those scenarios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 05:27\nUltimately, what I want people to take away from this is that you are\nhuman. You will panic when these things happen. Because as much as you\nmay think you have the answers, you don\u0026rsquo;t at that point in time. You\u0026rsquo;ll be\ngetting pulled a lot of directions with lots of people asking you lots of\nstrange questions that you don\u0026rsquo;t really care about at that point. Because\nyou\u0026rsquo;re thinking, if I can just recover System X or if I can just get the\nwebsite back online or just get the sales function working, then that will\ntake senior management pressure off me. Or can I get the attacker out of\nit? Are they still in the system? What have they managed to take? You\u0026rsquo;ll be\nthinking about so many other things that you really won\u0026rsquo;t care about. The\nkind of, are we going to be good? What damage does do to our business?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 06:05\nTake a breath and when you get into that scenario, this is when you need\nto know really clearly who you\u0026rsquo;re leaning on. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t just be a case of\nwho you can lean on internally, because your staff may be on holiday, they\nmay be sick, they may be out for another reason. It\u0026rsquo;s who you can lean on\nexternally and who you have trusted relationships with. Whether that be\nyour cyber insurance, whether that be a SoC partner, whether that be a\nsecurity software specialist, whether that be someone like Planet It in the\nMSP space. Someone that you can lean on and say, Right, it\u0026rsquo;s all gone\nwrong. I need help. And how can you help me? Get us back. It may be that\nit\u0026rsquo;s just to have someone to sound off against, but ultimately having that in\nplace and having that somewhere that you feel confident about leaning on,\nit is the key, really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 06:51\nThat\u0026rsquo;s something that I personally really suffered when I was in an\norganization and were hit with a cyberattack. Was that suddenly it went\nfrom, yes, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a massive problem I need to fix because our systems are\ndown and we\u0026rsquo;ve got a massive ongoing attack to I\u0026rsquo;ve got someone from\nsenior management standing over my shoulder, breathing in my ear,\nsaying, when\u0026rsquo;s it going to be back online? And I honestly don\u0026rsquo;t have the\nanswers. I\u0026rsquo;m just looking for a way to get through the day, as it were. Now\nI want to talk about those scenarios. Right, so these scenarios, as I said,\nthey are all real cases. These are things that have actually happened and\nthey\u0026rsquo;re in, what I\u0026rsquo;ve done is I\u0026rsquo;ve made sure that we talk about the space,\nthey\u0026rsquo;re in rather than talking about the business themselves. In scenario\none, we\u0026rsquo;re talking about a training provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 07:38\nThey are around 8000 users, or were around 8000 users at the time this\nattack. This attack took place in September 2020. Now, the dates that I\nwill give you, the case dates will be the date that we got involved. They\nwon\u0026rsquo;t necessarily be when the attack started, it\u0026rsquo;ll be the date that they\u0026rsquo;re\non our records. Some of these attacks, as you\u0026rsquo;ll see as we get into the\nattack chain, have actually been going on for a little while. The date that\nreferences when we\u0026rsquo;re involved. This training provider, 8000 users, they\nare massively, it heavy as an organization. All of those users are It users\nand their lifeblood is it. Therefore this attack was massively disruptive to\nthem. So let\u0026rsquo;s talk about it. First of all, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the type of attack.\nWell, this was actually a manually triggered and it was a targeted attack.\nIt was aimed at them as organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 08:27\nIt had been specifically written and designed as malware to attack them.\nThis wasn\u0026rsquo;t someone just getting lucky with an attack or spamming every\nIP address. This was targeted as them as an organization with the\nunderlying principle of stealing information from their CRM system. They\nhad some knowledge of the organization, but they actually ultimately\nknew the space they were in and what value there was in the data. The\nactual weak link in their system was a public facing link to their exchange\nsystem via Skype for business, their UC platform. This ultimately gave\nthem a server that was facing the Internet that was unpatched and open to\nthe wide world. This attack chain found that system very simply. It started\noff with scanning for an open port. They found that port and they also\nfound that this server itself was publicly facing and it had RDP unsecured\nand opened on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 09:26\nThey very quickly and very easily brute forced themselves onto the server.\nNow this brute force actually happened in February. So when we got\ninvolved was September. You can see already that those first three steps of\nthis attack chain happened multiple months before it was detected or\nanything really happened. In February they have scanned the IP addresses,\nthey found the unsuccessful port, they brute force into the server and\nthey\u0026rsquo;ve accessed via the Remote Desktop protocol this system. What they\nthen did was they did of investigation work for these attackers and they\ndid some IP scans, they pulled some data, they did some investigation\naround what they could see on the network, what ports are open, and then\nthey ran, mimicats and extracted the passwords from the memory of that\nsystem. Now, in the naivety of the team that had deployed this server,\nthey\u0026rsquo;d used a domain admin account to register this server with the\ndomain itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 10:21\nWhen they\u0026rsquo;d registered it with the domain, it had actually kept that\nCredential in memory and they hadn\u0026rsquo;t changed it since the server had been\ndeployed. Mimicats, a tool that scans through the memory and finds the\npasswords itself, was very effective in gathering that data very quickly.\nUltimately, from that, it then had the passwords it could use. They sat on\nthose passwords for multiple months before they did anything. Yes. Sorry.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve got your hand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 10:46\nYeah. What I really like about this is that sometimes this idea that the\nattackers have all the advantage, they can basically find one vulnerability\nand that\u0026rsquo;s it, and it\u0026rsquo;s game over. The defenders only have to defend\neverything all the time. I always challenge that with the idea that, look, a\nsuccessful attack has plenty of things that they\u0026rsquo;ve done that we could have\ndetected. If you think about it, every one of these points was a moment\nthat the team could have detected. They could have start raising the alarm\nbells, you could start hard to get an understanding of what\u0026rsquo;s going on at\nevery one of these. Right. In fact, I guess the more to the left you are, the\nmore mature an organization is from a defense point of view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 11:25\nRight, exactly. Yeah. That\u0026rsquo;s the thing, is what we\u0026rsquo;re looking at when I look\nat this professional is I want to be stopping the first two or three steps\nthere, not worrying about stopping the things at the very end, because by\nthat point, you\u0026rsquo;ve already lost control. That\u0026rsquo;s very much where this attack\nled to, was by the time that they\u0026rsquo;ve got the passwords from memory,\nthey\u0026rsquo;ve got access to a system, you\u0026rsquo;ve actually already lost the keys to the\ncastle. You\u0026rsquo;re just waiting for something to go wrong. They still had time\nto spot the system because that Mimicats tool was sat on that system. If\nyou\u0026rsquo;d logged into it, simply logged into it, looked on the desktop, you\ncould actually see the file there, but no one did, because no one was doing\nany form of maintenance. They just left it there. So it then progressed on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 12:04\nThey leveraged those credentials in September to access all the systems.\nFebruary they\u0026rsquo;d done the reconnaissance, they were ready to go, but they\nspent the time between February and September writing a custom script\nthat would use the information they\u0026rsquo;d already gathered to attack the SQL\nsystem that had the CRM data in it. It was all staged so that when they hit\nGo, there\u0026rsquo;d be lots of disruption. Very carefully, they\u0026rsquo;d be extracting the\ndata that they wanted while keeping the It team busy. And that\u0026rsquo;s what they\ndid. They leveraged the system details and they extracted the data from\nthe CRM. At the same time, every system that wasn\u0026rsquo;t part of the CRM\nstarted being encrypted. The systems were being deleted, files deleted,\nbackups being deleted, and the system was being locked out on mass, but\nthe distraction was there, that it was affecting domain controllers, users,\nprinting systems that people didn\u0026rsquo;t think, oh, what about the CRM system,\nwhich actually looked okay until they\u0026rsquo;d finished extracting the data they\nwanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 13:01\nThat happened to the CRM system as well, but ultimately it was detected\ntoo late, right? They detected it very much at the end of the attack chain.\nThey detected it when they saw the visible signs, when all the users started\nsaying they couldn\u0026rsquo;t log in, and when printers stopped working and they\nhad multiple other issues, they then went, hold on, we\u0026rsquo;ve been here. That\u0026rsquo;s\nwhen Planet It got called in and they were like, oh, we\u0026rsquo;re already out,\nwe\u0026rsquo;ve lost this, what can you do? We\u0026rsquo;re very much on the back foot then.\nWere able to extrapolate this information from all the log data and\neverything that we saw afterwards. Ultimately, let\u0026rsquo;s look at where they\nfailed. I\u0026rsquo;m being a bit honest here with this is kind of at the back of our\nreport, what we know that they failed. The first and ultimate painful thing\nis they underinvested in their It staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 13:48\nNone of their It staff had been trained in any form of cybersecurity, in any\nform of modern system protection. They all had good base It skills they\u0026rsquo;d\ncome into the organization with, but many of them had been there for five\nyears plus, and they had the new training in that time. They\u0026rsquo;d become very\nstale and out of touch with the way that things really work. There was a\nnumber of unchanged passwords from over five years, so the one that was\nactually used was a domain admin password. When we eventually got\nround to doing recovery in other world, we found there was passwords in\nthere that had been eight to ten years in an unchanged format. Ultimately\nlots of them were very simple passwords with no complexity at all, that\nactually they were lucky hadn\u0026rsquo;t been compromised before them. There was\nno multifactor authentication on any system at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 14:37\nEvery system they had, there was no MFA. You could literally go from on\npremise systems to three, six, five to their Azure environment without any\nMFA prompts. You could get into CRM without any MFA. You could even\nget into systems that they\u0026rsquo;d integrated like Google Suite and other things.\nYou could actually laterally spread really easily without any kind of\nbarriers to stop you. There was systemic failures in the way that the It was\nbeing managed. The It management had no understanding of the\nenvironment itself. They were there as essentially a caretaker, keeping the\nlights on, keeping people happy from a customer service point of view,\nwith no real care for the It systems themselves. They extended that lack of\nunderstanding though to the end users. They didn\u0026rsquo;t train the end users\nwith any kind of cybersecurity training or any kind of phishing training\nand they did no testing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 15:33\nHad this not been the way the attackers got in, there would have always\nbeen another way because they were so open, they were essentially they\nhad all of the doors open and all the windows open in their house. They\nalso had silly things like passwords on printed out, bits of paper stored on\nphysical media, there was password books just left on a shelf in the It\noffice. It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been hard for someone to have wandered in and\ntaken those passwords which ultimately weren\u0026rsquo;t very secure, so you could\nhave remembered them without taking the book as well. The things that\nthen become more of a problem for me are when we start talking about\nthe fact they had no representation around information security level at\nthe board. They had quite a large board of governance, they had quite a\nlarge management team. There was no one anywhere in those ranks with\nany kind of information security hat or even vested interest information\nsecurity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 16:24\nThe highest person was a mid manager who didn\u0026rsquo;t attend any of the senior\nmanager meetings, didn\u0026rsquo;t go to any of the governor\u0026rsquo;s meetings, they\nweren\u0026rsquo;t involved in the ownership of the organization. Therefore\ninformation security stopped at a point where it got no backing from\nanyone. They then really had a lot of things like misconfiguration, they\nhad a lack of products deployed, they had an underinvestment in their It,\nbut they also had a number of other breaches that had been recorded for\nover twelve months. Went through the attack that actually took them\ndown, happened in February, but went further back in the logs and were\nable to find stuff that happened twelve months before where people were\ntesting the security to see if they could get in. Because their firewall was\nmisconfigured and they didn\u0026rsquo;t have any kind of basic sanity check and\nthey had no pen testing, nothing like that, they just were open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 17:18\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where it comes into the end. They had no third parties, they had no\none to lean on. We got called in as who\u0026rsquo;s local to us, who\u0026rsquo;s available that\ncan help? It wasn\u0026rsquo;t through a kind of, oh well, we\u0026rsquo;ve got a cybersecurity\npartner we trust, like I talked about it was we need someone who\u0026rsquo;s got a\ncybersecurity background who can drop in and help us. That lack of\ninvestment really hurt them. Because even if some of the technologies\nthey\u0026rsquo;ve been using had been configured to the utmost standard, they had\nknown published vulnerabilities that were in existence but hadn\u0026rsquo;t been\npatched because the manufacturer no longer existed or the product they\nwere using just had gone out of support, end of life. The manufacturer\ndidn\u0026rsquo;t need to patch anymore. You could have done all the work in the\nworld and their firewall still had holes in it, those kind of things just can\u0026rsquo;t\nbe fixed so let\u0026rsquo;s look at the realism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 18:07\nRight, what did it cost them? These figures are actually from their\ninsurance documents, so these are actually correct. We\u0026rsquo;ve run them up\nbecause they\u0026rsquo;re higher than this. The instant recovery and repair cost\nthem 200,000 pounds. They had to find that money from their pockets, so\nthey had to dig into the budget and they had to dish that money out. That\nmoney was spent in about a six week window from everywhere, from\nrental of hardware through to professional services, through to everything\nthey needed to get themselves back on the road, back up and working.\nThat was 200,000 pounds they then spent, or sorry, didn\u0026rsquo;t we spend? They\nlost around three and a half thousand pounds a day in system outages.\nBecause they were a training provider, whilst they had no it, they couldn\u0026rsquo;t\nprovide training, so it was costing them three and a half thousand pounds\na day for these system outages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 18:57\nThe outages in most parts were resolved in around three weeks, but there\nwere six weeks of complete disruption before they were back to where\nyou\u0026rsquo;d say was normal working. There was a huge amount of disruption\nthere. That cost obviously tailed off towards the end. Ultimately they got a\nmassive fine from the ICO. So 150,000 pound fine for the breaches. The\ndata they lost around 80,000 records from their CRM, going from first\nnames and date of births through to medical information, through to\nacademic history, stuff like that. There was a lot of data that was lost. ISO\ndidn\u0026rsquo;t take that particularly well. The initial cost of the attack was\n450,000 pounds. The truth about the actual total cost of the attack, by the\ntime all was said and done and all the bills were settled and everything\nwas just over 2 million pounds. Now, the big thing for me here is that the\nCyber Insurance did not cover this attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 19:50\nThey spent that money in good faith. That 450,000 pounds thinking, right,\nwell, we\u0026rsquo;re going to get this back when claim on our insurance we\u0026rsquo;re\ndoing this. Because of the systemic failures that I highlighted in the\nprevious slide, there was no coverage. The cyber insurance invalidated.\nThey said, you haven\u0026rsquo;t done enough, and therefore they had to carry the\ncan. Now, ultimately, what happened to this organization was, and this is\nwhy I always use as a case study, their entire board level and senior\nmanagement team were let go a few weeks after this attack was resolved\nand it became clear that they weren\u0026rsquo;t going to get the coverage of the\nCyber insurance. The organization was then taken over by another\norganization and absorbed as part of a merger, as essentially a supported\nloss lead, because it had learners that were tied to the organization which\nneeded to finish courses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 20:44\nThere was a bit of government help there to make sure that merger took\nplace, but ultimately a massive financial impact and it affected a lot of\nlives. The people who thought they were safe, the people who were top\nlevel management, who had nothing to worry about because they didn\u0026rsquo;t\ncare about it, were the ones that got burnt. The It team actually stayed\naround, they weren\u0026rsquo;t hit by that massive swathe of sackings, they were\nsaved, but they ultimately all left in the long term. They\u0026rsquo;re not the only\npeople that\u0026rsquo;s happened to. I\u0026rsquo;m now coming on to a very fresh case. This\ncase actually happened in March this year, and this was for a 2000 user\nglobal electronics manufacturer, someone who we\u0026rsquo;ve known for a long\ntime and unfortunately a victim of their own success to a degree. They\nwere hit by actually an automated attack targeting vulnerabilities in web\nservers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 21:37\nMore specifically they were hit by a vulnerability in an open source plugin\nfor their website. Like maybe we use Shopify or you\u0026rsquo;ll use other plugins\nlike that. Essentially they put a plug into their website many years ago\nthat had a vulnerability that been around for around 18 months and they\u0026rsquo;d\nnot spotted it, they\u0026rsquo;d not patch that particular plugin, they patched the\nwebsite and patched the engine, the underneath of it, but they hadn\u0026rsquo;t\npatched that plugin. That plugin allowed a great deal of access. The\nattack chain starts in the same way this was done by scanning multiple IP\naddresses. And it just got lucky. It found a system and it found that\nvulnerability in the system. It found the unpatched web server. What it\nthen did was a SQL injection attack using that vulnerability to essentially\noverride the underlying server. It gained access, it gained root access to\nthe server and they used that leverage on that web plugin to gain\ncredentials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 22:41\nThey pulled credentials back out of the system that they could then use to\nreinject back into the system to gain a much higher level of authority on\nsome other systems that were open. Think like your VPN, access, web\ngateways, RDP, all those things that you would have protection in place\nbecause they leverage these credentials, they had more access than they\nshould have done. Now when they went in, this attack was purely done to\ncause disruption. There was no financial motivation as far as anyone\u0026rsquo;s\naware, there was no ransom note. What they did was they just went in and\nthey used an automated script to delete all of the systems inside their\nVMware environment, to delete all of their backups, and then delete all of\nthe access to their tape libraries. They were left with a system that in\nminutes became unusable and unaccessible. It was detected again, too\nlate, it was detected at the point the stuff that I get deleted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 23:37\nThrough their own naivety, they\u0026rsquo;d left things like tape libraries and\nImmutable backups plugged into the network. This attack was able to\ndelete information that should have been otherwise protected, putting\nthem in a much more vulnerable place than they should have been. All of\nthis was gained from a simple plugin that was just adding a very small\nfeature to their public website and it\u0026rsquo;s a feature that had they uninstalled\nit, probably nine out of ten customers wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have noticed. It was purely\nbecause they\u0026rsquo;d had it there for so long, they just left it in place and they\nnever thought, hold on, do I need to check if these plugins are patched?\nBecause they were manually added. They failed in a few different places.\nThe first one where they failed was they had a lack of staff. Their It team\nfor 2000 user business was very small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 24:28\nThey had systemic failures in their It management. Their It management\u0026rsquo;s\nfailures was they hadn\u0026rsquo;t asked for more staff. They hadn\u0026rsquo;t said we need to\nspend more money on security. They no investment in security again no\nMFA. This becomes a common story. You\u0026rsquo;ll see this through a lot of these.\nMFA is a great tool just to be a barrier if nothing else, to stopping these\nattacks. The text was stored in plain text on the server that was attacked.\nThe reason they were able to extract them so easily was once they were on\nthat web server, they had a lot of information in a word file that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t\nhave been there. There was no air gap in the way that this company is set\nup. They have a lot of servers, they have about 2000 public facing servers\nto be honest, in the way that they\u0026rsquo;re set up and there\u0026rsquo;s no real air gapping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 25:14\nThe ones that are public facing versus the ones that do internal systems,\nthe ones that are servers running devices that make their components are\nall in one flat network. That meant once you were in you could see\neverything. They had external sharing in place as well, which meant that it\nwas really easy for these attackers to find a lot of ways to inject additional\nattacks and additional vectors for them to start deleting data and\nspeeding that process up. There was no information security\nrepresentative at board level again. The It director for this organization is\na lovely person and they\u0026rsquo;ve done a really outstanding job. Without being in\nthat room and being at board level and saying, I need more money, I need\nmore investment, they were just shouting into a void. They knew they\nneeded more stuff, they needed better security, they needed to do better\ntesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 26:04\nThey were just unable to tell anyone. There was no DMZ in place on their\nfirewall. Everything again, flat network, easy for everything to sneak into\nthe network and they even had systems hosted inside of Azure and they\nwere accessible from the same flat network approach. The span of the\nattack was very easy to go. From on premise to the cloud and start really\naffecting their systems. They also have loads of legacy It equipment. What\nI mean by legacy is I\u0026rsquo;m talking about devices that run 2000, 2003 servers\nthat should have been decommissioned a long time ago, or if they\nphysically can\u0026rsquo;t be decommissioned because they\u0026rsquo;re attached to something\nthat only runs that version, they should be completely air gapped from the\ninternet and from the wider network. They had loads of those in place that\nyou could simply dial onto, but the organization essentially hadn\u0026rsquo;t scaled\nwith the business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 26:59\nThat was shown very much in my final piece, which is that they still were\nusing tapes, they still had tape based backups, so they had to rely on older\ntapes that would take a long time to recover. They had a long time to get\nback up and running from backups have been taken nearly a quarter\nbefore this attack happened. They lost the first three months to the year\nessentially in recovery. Again with this one, they\u0026rsquo;re a smaller organization,\nwe\u0026rsquo;re only talking 2000 end users. They spent 50,000 pounds on the first\nday on an instant recovery service. That was a rapid response service from\nthe company. Sophos and they offer that, it\u0026rsquo;s a kind of a set fee. So they\npaid 50,000 pounds for that. They were losing 5000 pounds an hour in\noutages because of the turnover and what this business does and the\nsemiconductors and the chips and all that stuff that it sells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 27:52\nThey were losing so much money per hour that it was a case of throw\nmoney at recovery. Let\u0026rsquo;s do it quickly and let\u0026rsquo;s get going. They then had to\nspend 90,000 pounds on a new system, on bits and pieces they should have\nupgraded anyway. They\u0026rsquo;ve then poured 90,000 pounds into all of that\nmoney was spent in a month. So, we are what, mid April now, all of this\nmoney has already been spent, this attack happened in March. Within a\nmonth they\u0026rsquo;ve spent a huge amount of money. They\u0026rsquo;ve calculated that one\nmonth of disruption cost them around 450,000 pounds, including the cost\nof recovery in the new system. That\u0026rsquo;s a huge impact to their bottom line.\nThey anticipate the final cost will be around the 540,000 pound mark.\nThey are lucky in the fact their cyber insurance will cover some of this\nbecause they had the right level of COVID in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 28:47\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not going to cover the full 540,000 pounds worth. It\u0026rsquo;s not going to\nrecover them from the loss of reputation, the damage that\u0026rsquo;s been done to\ntheir brand because they were offline. Companies that have been using\nthem for 20 years to buy parts couldn\u0026rsquo;t buy parts that day, so had to go\nsomewhere else. It\u0026rsquo;s never going to recover them from that and they will\nsee that damage for years to come in their bottom line. For scenario three,\nI\u0026rsquo;m going the other way, we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about a huge organization.\nThis is a multi site regional education provider. They cover a little over\n18,000 users across 16 sites, all in the UK. They\u0026rsquo;re an education provider.\nIt is critical in modern education. And they were hit really badly. The\nreason they were hit was they had misconfigured firewalls. That\u0026rsquo;s as\nsimple as that. Their firewalls were the weak link.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 29:44\nThey weren\u0026rsquo;t configured correctly, they weren\u0026rsquo;t configured to best\npractice. An automated attack got through them and was able to\nessentially encrypt all of their systems and ransom them, or, sorry, present\nthem with a very large ransom equivalent to a couple of billion pounds. I\nthink it worked out worth in bitcoin without having to have any\nintervention from a human. They were able to get all the way through, get\nonto a system and get it deployed like that. They started in very much the\nsame way. It scanned for IP addresses, it found direct access to a system.\nThis system was literally completely open and published to the net. It was\na server that you could have gone on any port you could have used, you\ncould have very simply, using the IP address, found some file shares on it.\nThere was no proper protection in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 30:34\nIt was something that everyone believed had been removed, but no one\nhad actually checked. The manual tools that were run on there were tools\nthat you would manually run to hack on it, but they were actually run an\nautomated script. Essentially, once they found this box, they dumped all\nthat on there. The script ran, pulled some passwords, it managed to work\nout that it could get onto every system because it was on the domain. It\nwas very much a legacy system. They silently deployed a payload across\nall the sites and systems. This is the key one for me with S is this was\ndeployed everywhere for around five weeks. The antivirus that was in\nplace on the endpoint didn\u0026rsquo;t notice it because the antivirus was\nmisconfigured as well. The antivirus was told not to scan the systems to\nsave because the systems were older, they didn\u0026rsquo;t want them to impact\nperformance, so they cut corners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 31:27\nThey said, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to scan systems. Once the package had been\ndeployed onto them, it was very easy for it to sit there under the hood.\nThey triggered this attack at a time that was coordinated across all sites.\nWhen they knew someone wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be there, so they knew their\neducation and they knew there was a half term coming up. They waited till\n330 on the day the half term started on a Friday, press the button. That\nattack then started, data was extracted, systems were encrypted, including\ncopies of their system that were online backups with a third party\nprovider. The system was in a complete disarray, unusable. They had to\nrebuild from the ground up. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about rebuilding every laptop,\nevery desktop, every network appliance. They had to start from scratch.\nThey are pretty much a new organization now versus where they were in\n2021 when this happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 32:26\nThey detected all this well too late. They actually came back in on the\nMonday to find none of the systems working. Everything was broken and\nthey were scratching the headers to why nothing was working. No one\nnoticed it. There was no alerting, no monitoring. All this attack happened\nover the weekend. When they came in the Monday they were essentially\ndead in the water and we came in a few months afterwards after they\u0026rsquo;d\nbeen trying to recover It themselves and then ultimately a midterday, they\ncouldn\u0026rsquo;t do the recovery and they needed some expert advice to guide\nthem through how to rebuild a system from scratch. When we look at\nwhere they failed, you\u0026rsquo;ll see there\u0026rsquo;s some very common themes appearing\nhere. The first one, there was no one at Information Security represented\nat board level. There was no one who had that vested interest. Again, It\ndirector would seem very high up in the business, but he had no voice at\nthe table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 33:16\nThe people that he reported into were not It people. They weren\u0026rsquo;t\ninterested in looking at what could be done. They were interested in other\nareas of the business. There was a huge lack of staff for them. They had\n16 sites, but only one person that was trained actually to cover those sites\nto a cybersecurity standpoint at all. They had systemic failings across It\nmanagement as the other ones did. They had misconfigured firewalls, they\nhad breaches again recorded for over twelve months on that system.\nThose breaches had done nothing. The big one for me that makes them\ndifferent is they ignored the early signs of an attack. They just went, look,\nwe\u0026rsquo;re seeing some strange behavior here. We\u0026rsquo;re seeing that there\u0026rsquo;s a\ncouple of these systems that we\u0026rsquo;ve rebuilt that have got random files on\nthe map, just be students or something. They ignored it. They had the\nopportunity there to stop it and to prevent this, but no one took the action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 34:13\nThe only thing on this slide that really to me only really takes effect, I\nsuppose previously in the education space, but now more in all businesses\nas we\u0026rsquo;re looking at this kind of cost saving Is. The organization was\nmassively focused on cutting costs and saving budgets. What they were\ndoing was taking money away from the It team and saying, well, we\u0026rsquo;re not\ngoing to invest in cybersecurity, we\u0026rsquo;re not going to invest in these areas\nbecause we don\u0026rsquo;t need to. This is a shocking one. The amount of cost for\nthis recovery. They spent a million pounds instant recovery. That was\nhiring in specialists, hiring in equipment, replacing equipment, requesting\nsoftware. They literally went town with a shopping list. They had\nconsultants in there who were coming in to build systems. They had loads\nof extra bodies running out. They spent a million pounds that came out of\ntheir pocket straight away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 35:06\nThey had to find that. They then got a fine from the Department of\nEducation and they had inspections across all the sites because of the\ndisruption they caused to teaching and learning that cost them nearly\n100,000 pounds in the actions that the DfE expected them to put in place\nafterwards. They then spent 700,000 pounds on replacing core\ninfrastructure that was just, they recovered to the old equipment and kind\nof got systems working. When it was looked at by the DfE and it was\nlooked at by ourselves as independent assessment, we made it very clear\nthat equipment wasn\u0026rsquo;t suitable moving forward. They had to spend\n700,000 pounds replacing that equipment and then they spent around\nanother 250,000 pounds procuring new third party suppliers. What I mean\nby that is they had an It support provider in place, a third party. They\ncouldn\u0026rsquo;t use them anymore because they couldn\u0026rsquo;t trust them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 35:59\nThey had to go out and tender for a new contract and then the money\nstopped spiraling. 1.1 million pounds spent essentially initial attack, but\nthen they overall spent just over 2 million pounds. They are never going to\nrecover from the damage that\u0026rsquo;s been done to the reputation. If you do of\nsearching, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to find them. They were in national papers, they\nwere all over social media, they were very high profile when they were hit.\nThe continuation of that effect is that parents are not sending their\nstudents to these schools. Their numbers are down, so their budgets are\nbeing squeezed. They\u0026rsquo;ve got a long road to recovery and they will continue\nto see this for years to come. The damage has been caused by this. Lots of\npeople at very senior levels were forced out of their roles. It\u0026rsquo;s a big\nchange. It\u0026rsquo;s not just, oh it\u0026rsquo;s, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 36:55\nThe final one I wanted to add is scenario four, small business in Snark in\ncompare comparison to the other ones, 500 users. But they\u0026rsquo;re a law firm.\nThe key there is I want to show this can happen to anyone and you\u0026rsquo;re not\nabove it just because of the sector that you sit in. We\u0026rsquo;ve had education\nproviders, we\u0026rsquo;ve had people that make microchips and now we\u0026rsquo;re looking\nat someone who is a law firm. This happened late last year and this was a\nstupid mistake. Again, as we\u0026rsquo;ve kind of mentioned a couple of times, this is\nsomething that they should have known about. Everyone saw the news,\nsaw the LinkedIn posts about the vulnerability around Exchange.\nExchange had a problem on premise. Microsoft very quickly released a\npatch and said you either deploy this update to your systems or you take\nthese systems off of public facing connections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 37:48\nThis organization did neither. They had scheduled to upgrade the server to\nthe new version of Exchange at a time that would suit the law firm. That\nwas scheduled for eight weeks down the road of the day this attack\nhappened. This attack chain follows the exact vulnerability. It used\nExchange OA to gain direct access to the system, leveraging the\nvulnerability in the unpatched server to deploy a command and control\nsoftware. In this case, it was the equivalent to your, like, log me in one,\ntwo, three, or team viewer. It deploys a version of that onto the desktop.\nOnce they\u0026rsquo;ve done that, they then use that system to deliver commander\ncontrol software to multiple servers. And then they started harvesting\ndata. Now, the big thing here is this was a law firm and they had lots of\ndata that was very interesting and a lot of high value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 38:40\nThis is the first scenario I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved in where the insurance\ncompany said, I think you probably should pay the ransom before any\nactions have been taken because of the type of business they were and the\ndata they had access to. The attack started harvesting data and then it\nstarted encrypting the systems. The ongoing attack was only spotted\nbecause of that routine server maintenance. The engineer who went to do\nsome basic maintenance to that server, he was going to install an update\non another bit of software logged into the system via RDP, saw a random\nicon on the desktop, and he called us and said, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t look right. At\nthat point, were like, this is not right. You need to shut down your access\nto your systems, cut your Internet connection, you\u0026rsquo;ve got something in\nyour system. Once the investigation was started, it was very apparent it\nwas too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 39:34\nBy that point, it was like, well, we could have got lucky and could have\nfound this just before it happened. Unfortunately, we didn\u0026rsquo;t. It had already\ndone the damage it intended to do. Just by the fact that they started\nscrubbing It, the C to C software, they deployed, started reinfecting lots of\nsystems and started respreading as they tried to do the clear up. Their\nfailures are a little bit different. The first one is the lack of critical\npatching. If a patch is critical, you should be deploying it that day. You\nshouldn\u0026rsquo;t be waiting to an appropriate time. The business should move to\nIt, not It. Move to the business. They had a consistent change of It\nmanagers. They had three It managers in two years. The rest of the team\nhad been there for 20 years. And that\u0026rsquo;s not collectively, that\u0026rsquo;s 20 years.\nFour people have been there 20 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 40:26\nSo they were stale in their roles. They lacked the training, they lacked the\nupdates to be ready for these modern kind of attacks. They also assumed\nthat the third parties they were paying were doing a lot of this work for\nthem, even though they didn\u0026rsquo;t check the contract. They didn\u0026rsquo;t know if they\nactually were. It was just assumed. They had no testing in place, no pen\ntesting, they had no cyber essentials, they had nothing in place. They just\nwere assuming their system was good because they felt it was. They had\nno monitoring as well, so none of these systems were being monitored. It\nwas assumed they were up and it was all good. The issue was just spotted\nby chance, had they logged into that server three weeks later or three\nweeks before? The outcomes have been very different. The threat actors\nhad been monitoring this vulnerability for months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 41:12\nThey had been able to deploy C to C software. They\u0026rsquo;d been able to get into\nsystem and really get a good understanding of who they were and really\nbuild a very strong attack that was going to give them most valuers as\nattackers. The entry point was ultimately a documented and no\nvulnerability that everyone was very much aware of. Their costs for an\norganization of their size are pretty scary. They spent 75,000 pounds just\ngetting off the ground with instant recovery. They were losing around\n10,000 pounds per hour because of unbillable services. So they had twelve\ndays. Ten of those were working. They weren\u0026rsquo;t able to bill for. They had a\nhuge loss of customers. You\u0026rsquo;re a law firm and you\u0026rsquo;ve lost our data and\nnow you\u0026rsquo;re telling us you can\u0026rsquo;t help us. There was a huge swathe of\ncustomers who left them initially, straight away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 42:08\nThey have then anticipated they\u0026rsquo;re going to lose about 100,000 pounds in\nthe next five years in profitability because of the damage that\u0026rsquo;s been done.\nThe initial attack cost them around 875,000 pounds, they reckon about\n1.4 million for the final attack cost overall. The truth of this one is they\nwill forever live with the reputational damage of being the law firm that\nwas hit by cyberattack. They won\u0026rsquo;t ever get away from that because\nagain, it was in the national press in the area. It was in the local press for\nthree or four days because it was very high profile that they were offline\nand they serviced some very high profile clients who couldn\u0026rsquo;t use them. It\nbecame quite a nice little local news story. Cyber insurance did cover some\nof this cost, but not all of it. We\u0026rsquo;ve talked about what happens, but then\nthere\u0026rsquo;s something that I always want to lean onto, which is just because\nover doesn\u0026rsquo;t really mean it\u0026rsquo;s over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 43:07\nOnce an attack is finished and you go, right, clean the art. I\u0026rsquo;ve had my five\ndays of working solid, we\u0026rsquo;re all good, all the systems are back up. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t\nmean you\u0026rsquo;re finished. You\u0026rsquo;ve got things you still need to do. You still need\nto do a post attack cleanup. There still will be systems, data, stuff that\nneeds scanning, cleaning, making sure that you\u0026rsquo;ve got no trace of any\nattack left in your system. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve been attacked once, you will\nalways get attacked again. The community online is really key on sharing\ndata of places that threat actors have been successful. It gets shared very\nquickly in the Dark Web, so you will get attempted reattacks. Whether\nsuccessful or not depends on the steps you\u0026rsquo;ve taken. If data was stolen,\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a high chance after attack it\u0026rsquo;s going to be used. Whether that\u0026rsquo;s for,\nwhether it gets sold online or whether you end up with them coming back\nto you for ransom, there\u0026rsquo;s a chance it\u0026rsquo;s going to be used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 43:55\nThere is always then the chance that you\u0026rsquo;re going to get legal challenges\nput against you. If you\u0026rsquo;ve mishandled customers data, you\u0026rsquo;ve mishandled\nany information. There\u0026rsquo;s always the ability for an individual organization,\nindividual or an organization sorry to challenge you, take you to court and\ntry and get some damages from you. The ICO in the UK will always get\ninvolved if the case is big enough and near enough. Every one of the cases\nI\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned, the ICO have been involved in some way. The level of\naction they\u0026rsquo;ve taken has been dependent on how they\u0026rsquo;re feeling at the\ntime, but they\u0026rsquo;re always going to be there. As I mentioned, threshold\nactors love to share success. You will lose business and clients to attacks\nas soon as people know that\u0026rsquo;s the thing that\u0026rsquo;s happened. Would you trust\nyour bank with your money knowing that they\u0026rsquo;ve managed to lose load of\nit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 44:39\nNo. You\u0026rsquo;re not going to trust a business with your business if you think\nthey\u0026rsquo;re not going to be good at it. You\u0026rsquo;re then going to have to rebuild\nyour reputation, you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to manage the press and any\npublicity, and there will be lots of jobs. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t always hit the It team or\nyour information security teams, your sock teams. It may hit upper\nmanagement, but that then will affect you. I always use this slide when I\u0026rsquo;m\ntalking to business owners and say, look, just because your It team are\ndoing their job, it may be that it falls actually on you as a business owner\nor a director that you\u0026rsquo;re responsible for these failings, and therefore, you\ncould be the one that\u0026rsquo;s losing their job at the end of this. Here\u0026rsquo;s the big bit.\nWhat should you be doing differently? Where should you be changing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 45:23\nWell, the first thing is everyone should be investing in their staff. Both your\nIt staff and your wider staff should be trained to a decent level of\ncybersecurity. All staff should have some form of testing done against\nthem. All staff should have yearly training done, but your It staff should\nhave more targeted training done more often as an It professional, always\nhave a paper trail of everything you\u0026rsquo;re asking for, everything you\u0026rsquo;re being\ntold you can\u0026rsquo;t have. There is always going to be those scenarios where you\nsay, I need 100,000 pounds to buy a managed threat service, and your boss\nwill go, not a chance. Have that paper trail because when this all goes\nwrong, you want to be able to go, sorry, I told you this was going to\nhappen, but always fight for those investments. Having been an It\nmanager for a number of years before I did this job, it is a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 46:14\nYou have to be the one that\u0026rsquo;s willing to stand in that room and say, if you\ndon\u0026rsquo;t give us this money, something bad\u0026rsquo;s going to happen and it\u0026rsquo;s on your\nhead, not on mine. Don\u0026rsquo;t also settle for risks. When a business wants to\nmake changes, they want to implement a system, they want to do\nanything. Don\u0026rsquo;t settle for the fact that it has risk with it. Be the one that\nflags it, be the one that says we need to change this. You should be testing\nthree things. It should be your staff, it should be the systems and it should\nbe your approach. Your approach is normally best tested with a third\nparty, someone who can come in and say, is that the right way to do\nthings? Maybe do it through certification like Cyber Essentials. You should\nbe physically testing your system with penetration testing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 46:54\nYou should be doing vulnerability scanning and you should be doing\nphishing and simulation training with your staff and testing them on a\nregular basis. Your staff are your weakest link. They also can be your best\nprotection. You need to make sure that you\u0026rsquo;re spending that time with\nthem doing this. Now, I mentioned at the very start around policies and\nprocedures, you just kind of try strategies and you just get on with things\nin the attack, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to do that. You should have dry run and\ntested all of your policies and procedures and your approach to Dr before\nthings happen. Now, I suggest you do that via what we would call a\nroundtable event, where you pull in your cyber insurance specialist, you\npull in your It team, you pull in business ownership, leadership, marketing.\nYou bring everyone into a room and you give them a scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 47:43\nI normally do it in a brown envelope, no one else knows what that says.\nYou open that up and say, right, this is what\u0026rsquo;s just happened. Now let\u0026rsquo;s\nwork through it end to end, how we get things sorted. Yes, to your hand\nup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:55\nCan I make a little addition here? One of the things that I use that and do,\nthe amazing examples, I definitely use some of the data because I think\nyou provide lots of really good examples. I tend to like to use existing\nincidents almost as dry run. Basically you take a P three and you run it as\na P one. In a way the justification is if you go back to your six of events is\nyou might have a P three business on the impact, I say at the end, but I\ncan justify to running a P one because it was detected there not detected\nhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 48:29\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:30\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s really interesting is that as you do that in a way, you\u0026rsquo;re not doing\ndry runs, you\u0026rsquo;re actually running for real. The first ones tend to be super\npainful. Even just getting the team together, just getting the stuff, getting\nthat machine starting slack channel super fast, creating playbooks, all\nthat stuff, right. That in a way, because it\u0026rsquo;s a P three, you have more\nmargin for error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 48:51\nYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:53\nI think that works really well once everybody\u0026rsquo;s on board with the idea\nthat, yes, this is not a P one for the business, but it\u0026rsquo;s a P one for security\nbecause we elevated that P three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 49:05\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the way often I have to do it. I often get brought into businesses to\nrun these and be the kind of outsider leading the scenario. I have to kind\nof do that, kind of the forcing everyone into a room and going, right, you\nare going to talk about this and you are going to see how bad it can be.\nBecause when it\u0026rsquo;s a real scenario and they\u0026rsquo;re trying to ring you at three in\nthe morning, they\u0026rsquo;re going to want to know where you are and why you\u0026rsquo;re\nnot answering your phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:25\nThe advantage of doing on top of a real scenario is that you can then do\nwhat ifs that are very realistic. My problem with a lot of even corporate\ndisaster recovery is everybody to relax. The VRS, right, the tabletops,\neverybody\u0026rsquo;s far too relaxed. It\u0026rsquo;s far too much optimistic around the table\nwhere when you have a real example, the whole idea that is this possible?\nJust went out the window because it just happened. Now, the attackers\nmight have turned right instead of left, which is why it\u0026rsquo;s a P three instead\nof a P one. But they happen to be there, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 50:01\nYeah, definitely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:02\nMatthew, you got your hand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 50:08\nHi, james and Dennis, longtime listener, first time caller. No, what I\nwanted to ask is you mentioned about fighting for investment, which is\nobviously very difficult. People hate spending money, they just hate it. I\nwas wondering, is it actually a good case to make that maybe spending\nmoney when it comes to maybe things like insurance, cyber insurance, you\nsave money by putting that upturn, investment in things like prevention.\nWill that bring the premium of your cyber insurance down?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 50:41\nYeah, definitely. I\u0026rsquo;ve got some bits on cyber insurance, but you\u0026rsquo;re right in\nterms of the way that I normally do it when I\u0026rsquo;m speaking to someone,\nbecause obviously I\u0026rsquo;m an outsider to a lot of organizations, I\u0026rsquo;m coming in\nas someone they\u0026rsquo;re bringing in to provide advice. I\u0026rsquo;ll say, look, I can show\nyou these real world scenarios and show you what the cost is if you get\nthis wrong and say, well, look, you could spend 100,000 pounds now or\nspend a million pounds when it goes wrong. Do you want to take the risk\nif you\u0026rsquo;ve got the million pounds in the back pocket. Often it comes down\nto weighing that up and saying, look, I\u0026rsquo;m happy for you to say, look, we\nhaven\u0026rsquo;t got the money, but that\u0026rsquo;s a you call for the business, I\u0026rsquo;m not\nmaking that call. A lot of the times, certainly being in It management\nroles, they try and put it onto your SEC ops, your It managers, and say,\nno, it\u0026rsquo;s your problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 51:24\nWith noise, if you\u0026rsquo;re not going to give us the money, it becomes your risk\nand you\u0026rsquo;re swallowing it. That\u0026rsquo;s the way I always try and take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 51:31\nBut you touch up for me. One of my, I think the pet peeves I have with the\ncybersecurity industry, in fact, we did a couple of sessions in the Summit\nthat talked about It correlation between your security posture and the cost\nof insurance. I think the cyber insurance companies are still pushing for\nsometimes big insurance blocks, but the new ones, I think, going in the\nright direction, where they, for example, ask you for data feeds. They ask\nyou for a lot of data. They fail to ask for digital data that they can\nconsume on your posture, and then they can adjust the premiums on it.\nAnd I think that\u0026rsquo;s the future. Because then you can go to a division or a\ngroup and say, look, yes, if you guys don\u0026rsquo;t invest on it, a, you have to buy\nthe risk, but also you have to buy these loans because the insurance for\nyour part of the business is going to be way higher than the insurance of\nthat part of the business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 52:14\nThat we actually have this business in place. Here\u0026rsquo;s the ask for the\ncybersecurity companies or an entrepreneur. I still feel that market is not\nwell served at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 52:26\nNo, at the moment it\u0026rsquo;s still very much an old fashioned insurance business\nin terms of going, oh well, you\u0026rsquo;re going to pay this much and that\u0026rsquo;s a risk\nwe\u0026rsquo;re taking. Whereas you could have spent a great deal making your\nsystem really secure and they don\u0026rsquo;t really care. They\u0026rsquo;re still going to give\nyou the same premium because it\u0026rsquo;s the price that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 52:40\nYou said, because it backfire, right, because they now run, they get to the\npoint where it starts to be uninsurable, right, companies where they\u0026rsquo;re not\ninsure because they just don\u0026rsquo;t have the data. Right. I think we\u0026rsquo;re facing a\nbit of a backlash of all these rush to do stuff, insurance where the\ncompanies didn\u0026rsquo;t really know what they were doing. They just sell lots of\ninsurance, then they got hit by lots of payouts and now I think they\u0026rsquo;re\nmodernizing, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think we\u0026rsquo;re there yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 53:10\nI say the final thing from this slide I want to take away is that security\nmust be your priority number one. We say it all the time, but when people\nare talking about launching new web systems. New services. Security has\nto be the trump card and your business needs to understand that if you go,\nthis isn\u0026rsquo;t secure, then the business needs to stop. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so many\norganizations that have failed because they\u0026rsquo;ve gone, well, we\u0026rsquo;ve got this\nlovely new app that we\u0026rsquo;re going to run and we\u0026rsquo;re going to launch it now,\nbut it\u0026rsquo;s not secure, the back end is not ready and they just do it anyway.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s something as an industry, we need to learn to change. We need to\nforce on people that it should be. Security is the gatekeeper. If security\nsays it\u0026rsquo;s not ready to go just because there\u0026rsquo;s a marketing deadline or\nsomething free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 53:52\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a big, hard thing to change in business, but it\u0026rsquo;s something that I\u0026rsquo;m\ncertainly with what we do at Planet, we\u0026rsquo;re trying to embed that into our\ncustomers, that you can\u0026rsquo;t get away with hiding from it. On that matter of\ncyber insurance, just to wrap up, I suppose there\u0026rsquo;s a few things I want to\nleave people with. We\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot of this recently, so it\u0026rsquo;s a must. You must\nhave cyber Insurance 2023. There\u0026rsquo;s no excuse for business to not have\ncyber insurance, but you need to read that small print. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of\nexpectations in that small print on you as an organization. There\u0026rsquo;s also a\nlot of caveats on how they can get out of paying and you need to be very\nmuch aware of what you signed up to, not just, oh, cool, well, X Company\nsaid they\u0026rsquo;re insure us, so we\u0026rsquo;ve signed up for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 54:34\nBecause when it all goes wrong, you may not be able to lean on that\ninsurance. You also need to understand their approach to an attack.\nRight? A lot of these organizations were attacked, they call their cyber\ninsurance and they have a cool, will we bring in X Team to do it, or? We\nexpect you to do y you need to know that, because if you start making\ndecisions and making changes, but their cyber insurance expects you to\ncall them straight away and their team to take over, you may have\ninvalidated your insurance immediately by even touching anything that\u0026rsquo;s\nbeen attacked. We\u0026rsquo;ve seen two instances, which I haven\u0026rsquo;t talked about\ntoday, where they didn\u0026rsquo;t get cyber insurance paid out because they started\nfixing the problem. Their insurance specifically said, if you find a cyber\nincident, you have to ring this number and our team will take over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 55:20\nAgain, understanding your coverage, that\u0026rsquo;s critical. You need to know to\nwhat value you\u0026rsquo;re protected and what they will cover. I would also argue\nthat you should be bringing someone from your cyber insurance into those\nroundtable exercises. Last three I\u0026rsquo;ve run, we\u0026rsquo;ve managed to get someone\nfrom cyber insurance there. It\u0026rsquo;s been really useful. They\u0026rsquo;ve come in and\nthey really open that conversation up because they go, well, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t\nwarrant that or we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t support that. The business then has to adapt\nits approach. You have to be aware they will not pay in some scenarios\nand you have to be ready for that. You need to have details of that cyber\ninsurance as well, kept somewhere other than your emails. The number of\nscenarios I\u0026rsquo;ve had where someone goes, oh, I have the login details for the\ninsurer, it\u0026rsquo;s on my emails, or I don\u0026rsquo;t know, it\u0026rsquo;s a PDF that we have saved\non our system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 56:07\nThat\u0026rsquo;s useless if you don\u0026rsquo;t know who insures you and you haven\u0026rsquo;t got a\npaper copy of the records, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be difficult if you have no, it\nsounds stupid, but I\u0026rsquo;ve done that a couple of times in the last three years\nand I\u0026rsquo;ve been like, cool, who insures you? No idea. Ensure the value is\ncorrect and don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to shop around. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to just buy any\nold cyber insurance. Loads of companies are offering really interesting,\ninnovative solutions that like you were talking about leverage, what\nprotection you actually have and go, great, well, you have managed\nthreat. Well, we\u0026rsquo;ll lower your premiums. Oh, great, you have industry\nrecognized firewalling in place. We\u0026rsquo;ll drop your premiums. You do pen\ntesting every month. Great, okay, we\u0026rsquo;re going to lower your premiums.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what you want to be looking for. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to insurer who\u0026rsquo;s\njust going to throw out a solution because it ticks their boxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 56:52\nBy the way, when you said that they come in and take over, a lot of times\nthey come in and take over an extra crazy cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 57:00\nOh, yeah, right. Or they come in, take over and walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 57:05\nThey also bring in lots of other companies. In fact, your company might be\none of them that gets called in van insurance. Right, but that gets charged\nat a crazy premium. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 57:14\nUnfortunately, yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s the way it works. Whatever we charge, they\u0026rsquo;ll\nput their premium on top of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 57:19\nAbsolutely. I just asked a really good question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 57:26\nYes, that\u0026rsquo;s correct. Hello, James, thank you very much for the\npresentation. In my PhD thesis, I\u0026rsquo;m investigating cybersecurity decision\nmaking dynamics, but I\u0026rsquo;m from international relations department, so my\nfield is different. Basically I\u0026rsquo;m trying to understand how these cognitive\nbiases or decision flows are impacting this kind of awareness trainings, or\nhow these decision flows impacting the decision, the quality of decision\nduring an incident and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 57:55\nYeah, I think from my experience, the quality of decision making very\nmuch falls apart if people haven\u0026rsquo;t got some form of bias in terms of if\nthey\u0026rsquo;ve not been exposed to technology or the way to approach things,\nthey crumble under the pressure. You\u0026rsquo;ll see that where a lot of these\nattacks get extended out is because the It manager or the security ops\nmanager hasn\u0026rsquo;t got the actual exposure to real world scenarios. They\u0026rsquo;ve\nread about it in their textbook and they go, yeah, this is what we do. They\ndon\u0026rsquo;t know what that pressure feels like. Some of the most successful\npeople and some of the people we have working for us who deal with these\nthings all day, every day, they have that cool, calm head because they\u0026rsquo;ve\nbeen there, they\u0026rsquo;ve done that, and they have that bias of, well, this is the\nway I\u0026rsquo;m going to approach it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 58:39\nAlthough it can be a bad thing to say, well, I\u0026rsquo;ve already made decision\nabout how I\u0026rsquo;m going to start fixing this, ultimately it gives them a\ngrounding in terms of, well, I know how I\u0026rsquo;m going to approach this. Even\nif I\u0026rsquo;m wrong with my initial, oh, it looks like this kind of attack, or it looks\na bit like it might be an imitate attack, they will at least have some kind of\nstrong belief that they will follow. I think that can especially in a high\npressure environment, that can be really beneficial. We see a lot of that in\nterms of where we get pulled in it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of the time it\u0026rsquo;s people that are\nunsure and don\u0026rsquo;t have anything to lean on. That\u0026rsquo;s where they start making\ndecisions that are kind of knee jerk and things that no one else would\nwarrant. You\u0026rsquo;d never make that decision if you were given it in a cool,\ncalm scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 59:26\nUnder pressure, they go right after deleted everything, it was easy. You\u0026rsquo;re\nlike, Why did you just delete everything? That\u0026rsquo;s just given us nowhere to\nwork from. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it happen where that was their initial response was\njust to delete all the systems because that was a way to fix it. So, yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s\na very good bit. I\u0026rsquo;ll be interested to read what you write because there\u0026rsquo;s\ndefinitely a lot of people under a lot of pressure out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 59:48\nEven in terms of budgets, right, and negotiations and when you\u0026rsquo;re\npresenting before the incidents or after incidents, having individuals who\nhave experienced it in past organizations or even an organization that has\nexperience makes a big difference, right. Unfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit like that,\nright. The ones who understand the side effects, they tend to relate. They\nhave a much more personal connection to the situation, so they can\nanchor much better the requests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 01:00:14\nYeah, that\u0026rsquo;s it. You have to have something to fall back on. That\u0026rsquo;s. For me,\nmy backing is the fact that I\u0026rsquo;ve unfortunately had to go through this\nbefore and I get to go through this with customers. It\u0026rsquo;s never a nice\nexperience, but I always learn from it. Every one of these that I\u0026rsquo;ve been\nbought into, when it\u0026rsquo;s happening, you just feel dreadful, but then\nafterwards you look back and you do the thought exercises afterwards\nand you go, actually, we learned quite a lot about how to deal with things.\nAs a business, we continue to get better as we get involved with these\nbecause we see we\u0026rsquo;ve learned from the 2030 that we\u0026rsquo;ve been involved in\nthe last three years. We\u0026rsquo;ve learned from those and we\u0026rsquo;ve learned a quicker\nway to respond and unfortunately the person that gets attacked tomorrow\nwill get a better response than the person who did three years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 01:00:56\nBecause we\u0026rsquo;re more aware of from the decision making that we\u0026rsquo;ve already\nbuilt into our processes, we know how to be more equipped to deal with\nthem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:01:05\nI use incidents as a way to also get a lot of stuff done, especially on the P\nthree elevated because it\u0026rsquo;s a great way to drive change. It\u0026rsquo;s a really\namazing way to drive lots and lots of change. Actually James, I\u0026rsquo;m going to\nmake you a host because I need to go to the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 01:01:24\nYeah, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:01:26\nFeel free to continue. That\u0026rsquo;s fine, you guys can continue until another\nquestions. Matt so then what you can do is just make the ones who ask\nquestion, right? Like for example, Matthew hand up just co host and then\nthey can ask the question and then just have the recording. Yeah, would it\nI was going to mute myself but you guys keep cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 01:01:47\nMatthew, you should be able to unmute now in theory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 01:01:52\nThere we go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 01:01:54\nI can use them. It\u0026rsquo;s not too bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 01:01:58\nYeah. So you picked my interest just there. You said you\u0026rsquo;ve been involved\nin 20 or 30 of these kind of coming in and fixing the problem. How many\nof these do you see where you\u0026rsquo;re running a managed service into\nsomebody and you stop an attack before it gets anywhere?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 01:02:14\nYeah, for a lot of our managed service clients we\u0026rsquo;ll be seeing the indicators\nof attack and we\u0026rsquo;ve got a large sock team and they\u0026rsquo;re dealing with that\nkind of early doors. Right, so those guys are picking stuff up in the kind of\nfirst two stages and dealing with it day in, day out. Those ones we don\u0026rsquo;t\nclass as instance because they normally get resolved out. To be honest\nwith you, most of the ones 2030 I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved in are from the other\nside. They\u0026rsquo;re people that aren\u0026rsquo;t our customers, or they might have bought\na tin from us, bought a server from us ten years ago, and they just know of\nour name. We get pulled back in as that kind of trusted advisor and that\u0026rsquo;s\nvery much those customers a lot of the time end up being managed service\ncustomers by the end of it, but we get pulled in very much from the outside\nof it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 01:02:54\nAs okay, well, tell us what you can do to help here with our managed\nservice clients. We try to be all over it and I think that\u0026rsquo;s one of the things\nthat we strive for, to be honest is that we are investing in our people to\nmake sure that we are stopping this attack change from managed service\nclients. Unfortunately being involved in some of these tax you see that\nwhere there is MSPs involved, they\u0026rsquo;re not always doing everything they\ncan do. They know that maybe the monitoring is not quite up to scratch or\nthey\u0026rsquo;re not pushing new technologies. One of the things that I do for our\nmanaged service clients and my team does, is that we\u0026rsquo;ll do that fighting a\nbit. We talked about earlier, we\u0026rsquo;ll be the ones that are going to have to\nfight with the MD or whoever the purse string holder is about these\nsecurity products and go, look, you\u0026rsquo;ve got us doing your It.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 01:03:41\nWe really need to be investing in these technologies and we\u0026rsquo;re kicking\nScream until it gets done because we know that without those tools in\nplace, we\u0026rsquo;re the ones that get hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 01:03:51\nThank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 01:03:52\nNo worries. Is there any other questions at all? I think perfect. Right, well,\nI am well aware that I\u0026rsquo;m overtime, but I just want to say to everyone,\nthank you for listening. If you did want to either have a further\nconversation or you just wanted to reach out and have a bit more of an in\ndepth discussion around some of the things we talked about, my email\naddress on the screen, you get my Microsoft teams. I don\u0026rsquo;t ever bother\nputting a phone number on there because teams come through to my\nphone and everyone does it that way, but I\u0026rsquo;m always available. It\u0026rsquo;s not\nsomething that we ever charge for. If you want to have a conversation\naround how we can help better protect your systems, that\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m here\nfor. If you want to learn from what other people\u0026rsquo;s mistakes are, that\u0026rsquo;s\nultimately why I\u0026rsquo;m here today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 01:04:39\nEverything I do for our customers is about helping us learn from mistakes.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily about spending money, it\u0026rsquo;s about going, well, where\ncan we better? Do feel free to reach out and I\u0026rsquo;m always available to\nfurther discussion. That brings me to the end of this session around the\ntruth around Cybersecurity. Thank you very much for your time and I look\nforward to seeing you all again soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 01:05:20\nHi, James. Just before I pop off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 01:05:25\nYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 01:05:27\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve actually just really interesting stuff. It was really sorry, lots of\nwords. End of the end of a Monday. No, it was really interesting hearing\nyou talk about all the case studies you\u0026rsquo;ve been through, but this like, did\nyou say would you think you\u0026rsquo;ve covered like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 01:05:50\nThe worst of the worst?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 01:05:51\nYou mentioned the huge one that you came in and dealt with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 01:05:53\nYeah, I think some of these are kind of it gives a good flavor across the\nspaces. There\u0026rsquo;s quite a few that happened around kind of 2021 to 2022,\nwhich were all very much targeted one sector. We saw a lot of attacks in\neducation and that was across the board. I think everyone saw that it was\nin the press a lot. There was a window where I think we used to about\nseven or eight back to back, where it was just education providers being\nhit. You see it, and they have a very similar vein to their attacks. The ones\nthat I shared there are kind of the very worst 16,000 users, but then some\nthat cover some of those nice user sizes. We do see the kind of 25 users get\nhit with attacks, but they\u0026rsquo;re kind of the ones you can recover from with an\nafternoon of hard thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames Dell - 01:06:36\nWhereas someone that\u0026rsquo;s been running for 20 years, all that data becomes\nvery difficult to cover.

It\u0026rsquo;s October 18\nand we have a panel session regarding threat modeling for serverless\narchitectures, if I\u0026rsquo;m not wrong. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re going to discuss.\nAnd we Denis Cruz on the line, Ayse Vlok from Vlog, Louis Servin, myself,\nand I\u0026rsquo;m not sure who else is joining.

Ayse, would you mind going first?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 01:04\nYeah, sure. Hi everyone. My name is Ayse. At the moment I am the head of\nPlatform Security Engineering at Densu. My background includes security,\ngovernance and compliance, security operations, security engineering,\ncloud security, and now I\u0026rsquo;m heading a security engineering function.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 01:31\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a big job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 01:35\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ll introduce myself. I\u0026rsquo;m Louis Herbin, security architect, currently in\nthe role of platform security lead at a very big shipping company called\nHapacloid. I have a bunch of experience over ten years in application\nsecurity, having created and rolled out application security programs with\na strong focus on threat modeling at this is my fourth company where I do\nthis. So it\u0026rsquo;s been a journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 02:07\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 02:08\nI\u0026rsquo;m Denis Cruz, I\u0026rsquo;m the CISO of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 02:11\nHolman Barrett, a UK retailer and a chief scientist of Glasswall, a UK\nkind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 02:16\nOf reasonably big startup these days. And I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing threat model, I\nthink since the beginning, I think, when he barely wasn\u0026rsquo;t called threat\nmodeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 02:28\nI\u0026rsquo;m a big fan and I think it\u0026rsquo;s a key part of the solution. So, looking\nforward to this session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 02:39\nPerfect. So how shall we start? Shall we ask each other questions? Shall\nwe put a topic on the table and try to move around it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 02:47\nYeah, I think that\u0026rsquo;s a good one. In fact, maybe just from a scalable point\nof view, why don\u0026rsquo;t we just.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 02:55\nStart with that topic of how to scale threat modeling? And that post you\nwere just mentioning about using GBT, especially the new visual element\nof it, right. To try to make a good dent on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 03:13\nCertainly. So I work currently with about 800 developers, growing to 1000\nwithin the next couple of years, probably, and we\u0026rsquo;re trying to roll out our\napplication security program right now. One thing we have been\ndiscussing, or where we\u0026rsquo;re putting the emphasis rather than the\ndiscussion, so we\u0026rsquo;re already active on this, is having cybersecurity\nchampions in every single development team. So we\u0026rsquo;ll have at least 80 to\n90 security champions in the company, and every security champion is\nembedded within their team. So at least we have someone who has heard\nof security in the team who can be our inside person. He or she will help\ndo these activities and make sure that these activities take place. But then\nthe question of threat modeling is difficult, first of all, because it has\nseveral stages. So diagram what do you need as a diagram for threat\nmodeling?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 04:21\nVery often we have boxes joined by arrows, by lines. What is the context,\nwhat is the reason of this arrow existing and joining the two boxes? What\ninformation can we take out of the diagram? Many times we don\u0026rsquo;t have an\nintention. Why is there a connection between two boxes? And that makes\nthreat modeling in an automated way very difficult because you cannot\nlook at the intention. You cannot see whether there\u0026rsquo;s something there just\nby looking at the diagram that screams of lack of encryption or anything.\nYou might have the port, perhaps the protocol, but you have no idea,\nreally, in most diagrams I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far whether that is actually still\ncurrent. I have yet to find a single diagram in all my experience, that is up\nto date. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 05:18\nIn Agile development, diagrams are the last documentation is the last\nthing that gets updated. It might be part of the definition of Done, but it\u0026rsquo;s\nnever updated. So I can try to put a diagram into Chat GPT or ERUs Risk\nor any other platform, recreate it there. But what is the value of that if the\ndiagram is not current? So the biggest challenge for scaling this is the\nvalue of threat modeling is the conversation you have around the system,\naround these possible shortcomings and possible attack scenarios derived\nfrom vulnerabilities or shortcomings in the code. So I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure\nthis can scale. I think this will remain at a craft level for a number of\nyears. I mean, you can verify in the implementation level on the cloud\nmany things that will alert you of vulnerabilities, but that\u0026rsquo;s not threat\nmodeling, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 06:23\nThat has happened already. You couldn\u0026rsquo;t prevent something. So I\u0026rsquo;ll give\nthe mic to Aisha. Maybe she has a better idea or want to comment on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 06:35\nNo. I think you touched upon a couple of dilemmas that I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced\nin my career as well, and I\u0026rsquo;ve seen one of them. Is it\u0026rsquo;s definitely true that\ndocumentation and diagrams are the last update? Sometimes developers\ndon\u0026rsquo;t even know the latest status themselves to be able to provide up to\ndate one. So if the diagramming problem was sort of solved, it could help\nwith the scaling. In the past, I used like AWS perspective. There are a\ncouple of companies coming up now providing solutions, but with that is,\nlike you said, you\u0026rsquo;re looking at what\u0026rsquo;s already in place rather than design\nstage. So that\u0026rsquo;s more like a security review, retrospective trying to put\nsomething in rather than bringing it together. And I like the idea of threat\nmodeling becoming a sort of an event sort of thing, bringing people in\ntogether and understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 07:45\nIt\u0026rsquo;s sort of like an awareness session that you can get in as well as what\nyou\u0026rsquo;re trying to do with the modeling itself, with the action items\nafterwards. Yeah. So those are the comments that I can really make. One\nthing that I\u0026rsquo;ve in my experience I\u0026rsquo;ve experienced sorry, in my career I\nexperienced is that infrastructure configuration have sort of been left out\nquite a lot. I I did briefly in the past look into incorporating all that in.\nHence me looking into if applications are becoming more and more\nserverless reliant on native cloud services, then configuration, access\nmanagement, IAM configuration of certain services, your pipeline, how\nyou push them, become really important as well. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 08:50\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 08:50\nSo I think you\u0026rsquo;re touching on a couple of interesting points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 08:52\nLet me ask you this question. If we had good up to date documentation\nand good up to date description of intent of what the code is supposed to\ndo, or it does, actually, and good visual representations I e. Diagrams on\nthat in a sort of diagram as code environment where you can version\ncontrol it. Would that change the threat modeling landscape and the\npractices that we have today?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 09:24\nIt could if we\u0026rsquo;re consistent across teams in how we document and create\nthese diagrams. The thing I don\u0026rsquo;t see talked about too often is what\nexactly is worthy of being diagrammed and how do you want to diagram?\nBecause even though the infrastructure might have a web application\nfirewall in front of the application, sending everything to the wasp\nbasically makes harder the analysis afterwards because what you want to\nsee is the connections between the user and the thing with a transparent\nwas, as if the request had passed already. The was and hit the backend\nservice or the load balancer. So many diagrams I see get lost in too many\ndetails and the right level of detail is incredibly important to get value fast\nout of a threat model or data flow diagram, if you want to call it that way,\nfirst of all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 10:26\nAnd second, do we need diagrams for security purposes or should one\ndiagram suffice? And I\u0026rsquo;m convinced one diagram is enough, but we just\nneed to be methodological across teams on how we do it. And yes,\ndiagrams as coded would be fantastic. But then it\u0026rsquo;s a new paradigm which\nis not taught in whatever people learn how to code. Right. It\u0026rsquo;s something\nthat the teams, the organization have to agree on and create competence\non and then it\u0026rsquo;s up to someone in the company to set the path, create the\ntraining material and get everyone on board and haggle a little bit, even\ntake and make sure that everyone has something similar, at least. Aisha,\nyou want to say something?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 11:22\nNo, but I want to ask you if you can give more information, tell us more\nabout like Dennis said, in an ideal world, if we had the right diagram up to\ndate, it\u0026rsquo;s reflecting the architecture and the application as it is for security\npurposes. How does it work with chargebit, if you can? A little bit\nelaborate on that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 11:56\nSo the reason I asked that question was a bit loaded because I think a lot\nof the conversations we have about Jet GBT and NLMs are a bit not very\nwell aligned. So I like the analogy these days, you know, Jarvis from the\nconcept of Iron Man. Tony Stark uses Jarvis as kind of his system. You\nguys get that reference. I think what happened here was we invented\nJarvis and then we asked Jarvis to write poetry and sing and then complain\nthat it\u0026rsquo;s making up lyrics, right? But meanwhile, it\u0026rsquo;s Jarvis, right? It has\nthat capability. So when I think about the AI gen AI, I\u0026rsquo;m not thinking\nabout, for example, something that\u0026rsquo;s going to create code and you ship it\nand you look at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 12:45\nSo this is a perfect example of we can use chattbt to create\ndocumentation, we can use chattbt to create architecture diagrams,\nbasically to start creating that documentation that I think we can all agree\nthat up until now, the development workflows has failed to create. If they\ncould create it, they would have it, right? So I\u0026rsquo;ll give you a good example.\nYou can take a git diff I e what change in a know commit, and you can\ngive it to chat GBT, and it gives a really good analysis of what was there,\nright? So if you start to extrapolate that, it means that, for example, you\ncan go to chat GBT and say, explain me this function. Right? So let\u0026rsquo;s say\nyou have a class. You first get chatgbt to go, explain me each function,\nand then you can go explain how the class does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 13:34\nAnd you can even start to connect the dots. So you can start to get chatgpt\nto create documentation about how an application works. And you can\nalso use it to create, even if not fully. Now, we\u0026rsquo;re not that far off because\nthe hard part is already done. And the hard part is to have a system that\nunderstands code. And it might even be that Jgbt is not even the best one.\nIt might be that AWS code Whisperer or whatever it\u0026rsquo;s called, or even\nCopilot has been trained like that. But we can have an Llam that basically\nis able to understand code, understand meaning that\u0026rsquo;s more important.\nNot just the code, but the meaning of the code and what is doing. And\nthen you connect the dots. So eventually you will have an application\nmapped. We\u0026rsquo;re not that far off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 14:24\nAnd once we start to play at that world, in a way, we do threat models on\ntop of it. But the first step is to have code that is actually explained. And\nit\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily just documentation of the code, is the intent of the\ncode, is what the code actually does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 14:43\nThe question is whether the code is the right level to create.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 14:47\nSometimes might be I don\u0026rsquo;t understand what they kind of don\u0026rsquo;t know\nwhat it is right now. Go on, Luke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 14:54\nSure. The question is one of levels of detail, right? So at which level do\nyou want to do your threat model? So we\u0026rsquo;ve discussed this in the past, you\nand me. And I like to take an approach in which I start from a very high\nlevel, in which I try to understand the business case, create use cases\naround it, and start going to the details. Using chat CPT to look at the\ncode is starting already at the details. But then I would need to look at the\ndetails. I would need to look at the infrast code. I would need to build\nupon that, perhaps ask UBT to build the domain model or the business\nconcept around it. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that\u0026rsquo;s necessarily the way to go without\nchatty. Perhaps hallucinating too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 15:41\nBut if you do it in bits, right, why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t that not be possible? Why\nwould it not be possible to feed, to stay? And by the way, Asia, when you\ntalk about mapping infrastructure, you spot on, because that\u0026rsquo;s a massive\nblind spot that we have in our threat models, in our security reviews,\nbecause you need the context of whatever the application that we\u0026rsquo;re\nreviewing is running at the right. But you can now do this kind of analysis\nalmost at a lot of levels. And then, more important, you can do analysis of\nanalysis and of analysis. And if you keep raising the abstraction layer, you\nshould arrive at Lewis, the top level architecture. But the beauty of this is\nthat I\u0026rsquo;m not saying that this is all done automatically. This should all be\ndone by the humans in the loop very finely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 16:28\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s very easy for somebody who understands the system to confirm or\ndeny or say, no, this is right, this is wrong. And then you kind of add some\ntraining to the system or to the data, and then you start to get good\nrepresentations of reality. And even if you think about it, even if that\u0026rsquo;s not\nfully possible, you can start to connect the logs to say, look, even although\nwe don\u0026rsquo;t think this is possible to go from A to B, we\u0026rsquo;ve seen logs from our\nfirewalls, from our internal systems, from our traffic flows. That actually\nmeans that traffic did arrive here. But a lot of this stuff in the past were\nimpossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 17:04\nAnd I think now with the LLM, as I can understand context, can\nunderstand complex data, even raw data like data dump or a firewall log\nor an im policy, this is becoming reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 17:20\nYeah, I think it\u0026rsquo;s just too exciting. Once again, my brain is rushing right\nnow, thinking of all the possibilities at the moment. It\u0026rsquo;s endless. Because\nimagine you could also give permissions to be able to query your cloud\nitself and carry out the API calls to check its actual status as opposed to\nwhat it thinks the risk is and everything. So it\u0026rsquo;s not impossible. I think that\njust imagining it is just brilliant. Think of it like a giant, very, extremely\nwell informed machine that\u0026rsquo;s going to be able to tell you see the big\npicture, because that is the trickiest bit, being able to see the big picture at\nhigh and low levels all at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 18:18\nOkay, here\u0026rsquo;s a very important concept, right? And the big paradigm shift\nthat I kind of did when I was looking at the models recently is I thought\nthat we had to train the models, right? So I thought that you had to take a\nmodel like, for example, that vision that you just showed of the big picture.\nOne way to kind of do it is to pump all the data and train the model like\nthat. Right? But I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that\u0026rsquo;s what best architecture for that. I\nactually think that what you have is you have lots and lots of explanations\nand small parts of basically the puzzle that we can now glue together. And\nwe can have models analyzing data from other models or keep feeding it,\nbut at every space we have basically documentation level. Does that make\nsense?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 19:15\nIt\u0026rsquo;s almost like even if you start with a source code, look, take a simple\nfunction. You could take a function in the source code and you can say,\nanalyze this function, tell me what it does. Right. Technically, tell me\nexactly what it does. And then you could say, okay, give me an architecture\nflow for this. And then you can say, okay, so this is a function that is\nsupposed to, let\u0026rsquo;s say, get a file from this on this particular scenario. So\nnow you can do analysis on the behavior of that function and you can even\nstart to do analysis on the business function of that function, right, but\nevery one of these needs to be stored, for example, in kits, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 19:52\nSo every piece of the puzzle, the problem we always had in the past is\nwhat didn\u0026rsquo;t scale was the maintainability of this data. That\u0026rsquo;s the problem.\nThe problem was you could always sit down and map the whole\narchitecture, but by the time you finished, you would have changed, right?\nAnd if you figure out something was wrong, you couldn\u0026rsquo;t easily modify it.\nBut now we\u0026rsquo;re going to be able to. So I kind of imagine what you just\ndescribed, not like a massive model like a Chat GBT for App X, but almost\nlike a Chat GBT or a code analysis engine that we then feed the right level\nof abstractions as almost the embedding, the prompts, and then ask\nquestions. And that also makes it very easy to understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on,\nvery easy to understand the outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 20:46\nAnd you\u0026rsquo;re also reducing the complexity of what basically the Chat TBT\nneeds to be looking at. And also you reduce hallucination, but by a lot\nbecause you\u0026rsquo;re almost seething the data that is doing the analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 21:06\nI got it. Yeah. It\u0026rsquo;s like in my head, the analogy I\u0026rsquo;d use is like instead of an\nelephant, think of a cheetah. You just want the agility to be able to pick up\nthat fluidity of the end state to keep the diagrams up to date, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 21:28\nKind of, yeah. You should be able to zoom in and out, but it\u0026rsquo;s almost like\nat every layer of the zoom, you\u0026rsquo;re loading different data points into your\nprompt. You could have analysis that talks about the architecture. You can\nhave a layer down that talks about data flows. You can have another layer\nthat contains information about the business analysis. So this allows us to\nbring a lot of context into the layers. But it\u0026rsquo;s almost like we use Chat, GBq\nor whatever, LLM to provide context and to do the analysis. Almost a\ntranslation from one part to the other. But then we store it and that\u0026rsquo;s what\nyou feed to the next analysis. Did you know, who needs these more than\nwe? The developers. Right. And the business, because they need it too.\nImagine you need to maintain that system, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 22:36\nImagine maintaining a system that you don\u0026rsquo;t understand. Imagine\nmaintaining a system that there\u0026rsquo;s no architecture diagram for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 22:42\nThat\u0026rsquo;s really hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 22:44\nEvery system I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in my life, we\u0026rsquo;ve been there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 22:49\nYeah, but then talk to the developers and see how stressed they are. Right.\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s a reason why. Because they having to maintain a system that\nthey don\u0026rsquo;t understand. And they do understand. It left long ago, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 23:02\nYeah, exactly. I would definitely love to see it in action. And I\u0026rsquo;m most\ninterested in the Gluing part. Look, there might still be things that will\nrequire, like you said, the qualitative analysis of what\u0026rsquo;s coming out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 23:23\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the thing. Right? Every one of those requires qualitative analysis.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s, for me, is the key piece of the puzzle. Every one of those outputs\nhas to be analyzed, verified in a way signed off by somebody who\nunderstands the context. The difference is that scales because it\u0026rsquo;s a one off\nexercise. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 23:48\nWho is the person who will be doing that? Very often, I find, when I start\nasking questions about the system, developers are very knowledgeable on\nthe classes they\u0026rsquo;re using, the libraries they\u0026rsquo;re using up to a level. Then\nsometimes they have to switch off to someone who is like the DevSecOps\nperson or the ops person who knows the infrastructure. But then these\npeople, whenever you ask them about the business context, they can never\nexplain to you, why does this system even exist? What is the business\ncontext?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 24:23\nI agree, but think about this, right? So you do that exercise and you\u0026rsquo;ve\ndone the mapping and then the threat models in your head. You now have\nprobably one of the best views of the application, correct?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 24:40\nCertainly, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 24:42\nBecause you connect the dots, right? You follow the things. Like you said,\nyou talk to the SecOps guy, he gave you this. You talked to the\ndevelopment team, he gave you that. You talked to the business analyst.\nGive the puzzle the problem. What you didn\u0026rsquo;t left behind was a the\nknowledge and the way to get that knowledge. So imagine doing the same\nthing, but every time you ask that question, you put that to an LLM and\ngoing and you look at the outputs of the LLM and then what you\u0026rsquo;re doing\nis you\u0026rsquo;re confirming it\u0026rsquo;s almost like imagine you\u0026rsquo;re confirming that is the\ncreation of that knowledge correct? Is the prompt that created that\nknowledge correct? Is this LLM that I use to create a logic correct?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 25:23\nBecause if it\u0026rsquo;s not, then you have a problem, but if it happens to be\ncorrect, then you know you have a good LLM, a good prompt that now is\nable to produce, for example, a technical analysis that the technical\nperson confirms. Yes, that\u0026rsquo;s how it works. That the business analysts go,\nyes, that\u0026rsquo;s how it works. And then if you add this to the mix that, for\nexample, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be right, because eventually we will be able\nto fine tune it. So, for example, if there\u0026rsquo;s a security vulnerability or you do\nanalysis, oh, that path is wrong, which is one of the things sometimes we\nfind in thread models, right, find blind spots. How your curves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 25:58\nThe problem is at the moment you have no way to go and verify or to\nchange the logic that created the artifact, where in this case you have to\ngo back to whatever LLM or whatever prompt was used to create that\nartifact and go, oh, we need to fix that. So again, these scales a lot more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 26:21\nWhich then makes the threat model of the LLM even more exciting, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 26:26\nExactly, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 26:28\nSo not the threat model of the system, but of the LLM, right? So where do\nyou hold all this information? How do you keep it in house if you\u0026rsquo;re a\ncommercial company so that you don\u0026rsquo;t leak data inadvertently when\nsomeone for a sample architecture from your company, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 26:50\nBut that problem starts to be solved already because you already have\nprivate models, right? So if you use zero OpenAI, if you use bedrock, a lot\nof those are already private models that they\u0026rsquo;re not using your data, right?\nAnd again, Google\u0026rsquo;s Vertex already has massive claims on they say your\ndata is your data. Right, like that. But I also raised the question that in a\nweird way, the less powerful and expensive LLM, the better, as long as it\nproduced the right results. So, for example, you already have a lot of\nscenarios where with a good prompt charge, EBT 3.5 is better, faster than\n4.0, right, so then you\u0026rsquo;re right, the LLM becomes by far important, but we\ncan verify the output of the LLM, which is why I always say that the\nfeedback loop is so critical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 27:51\nYeah, sure, there is definitely some prompt crafting that will need to be\nrefined. Difficult though, that\u0026rsquo;s the bit that how do you verify? Are you\ngoing back to the beginning where you\u0026rsquo;re like, okay, well, I still don\u0026rsquo;t\nknow what the end state is. No, but GPT verify with it because it already\nhas the information of end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 28:24\nState, then look, you verify it. Like for example, I would love to learn from\nyou on how you approach a thread model, but I can\u0026rsquo;t at the moment,\nright? Is or you might say you like to learn from me. I would like to learn\nfrom imagine being able to get in the brain of Michael Howard when he\ndoes a threat model, right? Or Adam schulshi. Go. That ground. Right?\nBut if I could see the prompt that you asked that helped to create an\noutput that you confirmed was correct, I could do that. And in this case,\nit\u0026rsquo;s you who verify it because you can look at it. Right. The problem is you\ngo from an art form where you go from A to an output which is in your\nhead, versus a by an LLM, the output you break a little bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 29:27\nYeah, it\u0026rsquo;s breaking a little bit. No worries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 29:42\nI think you were yeah, maybe go to the serverless mode more talk about\nserverless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 29:57\nSure. Okay. Aisha would need to rejoin. She cannot hear, something broke\non her side. So how do you approach serverless? Right? So, yeah, it would\nbe great if Chatt would do everything for us, but at the moment it can\u0026rsquo;t.\nOr not everyone knows how to do it, so maybe it can, but we don\u0026rsquo;t all\nknow how to use it that well to get the output. So we still have to do it by\nhand. So how do we approach a serverless architecture? And I think here\nthe question is are we using serverless as it intended to be or are we taking\nour knowledge from the old way of systems like we used to build them in\nthe early two thousand s and try to apply it to serverless architectures?\nRight? So one thing that is crucial in the cloud is identity. Identity is the\nperimeter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 31:06\nSo how are we looking at identity? That\u0026rsquo;s one of the first questions I ask\nmy stakeholders. So how do you identify your lambdas, your Azure\nfunction with the services? They consume themselves and very often\nthey\u0026rsquo;re still using passwords or they\u0026rsquo;re using things that they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be\nusing. And even if they\u0026rsquo;re using key vault, why even store the key as an\nenvironment variable which can be leaked and not use the native identity\nand access management functions or identity that you can provide to a\nlambda function and thus have a very granular access to the services and\nget rid of the whole password story. Right? So that\u0026rsquo;s one of the first points\nI usually ask for when I\u0026rsquo;m doing a threat model, because that\u0026rsquo;s usually a\nhigh gain, low hanging fruit that almost everyone is Ailing from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 32:08\nOne other thing is, okay, we all know that there is a possibility for server\nside request. So I trick the server, the function to do a request on my\nbehalf so I could trick it to dump environment variables I could trick it to\nmake a request to an external server. I could trick it to make a request to\nsomething inside my network and get more data the function shouldn\u0026rsquo;t\nhave actually access to. So the second question I usually ask when\ndiscussing serverless architectures is, okay, identity is clear. Now, how are\nyou limiting connectivity for this function? Are you grouping them inside\nnetwork security groups or are you doing something to cluster them and\nisolate them from the outside world?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 33:02\nSo those are like the first two points I usually attack when looking at\nserverless architectures because you have to start somewhere and those\nare like the easiest places to start and get some feedback. Hardly will both\nissues be considered from the get go in any architecture I have seen. So,\nAishen, maybe you want to give a trick or two on how you do serverless\nthreat modeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 33:30\nFirst of all, maybe I can talk about my gripe with it and the industry as\nwell. So while it is different, right, it requires cloud knowledge, it requires\ncloud provider specific service knowledge as well, right? So let\u0026rsquo;s begin\nwith that. In our industry, that is what you will need to have if you\u0026rsquo;re\ncarrying out threat modeling for service architectures. And it also requires\nknowledge around how to best securely configure them, how to best have\nthe state of your already existing infrastructure because it\u0026rsquo;s sitting on top\nof it as well. If we look at like an AWS environment, let\u0026rsquo;s just go with AWS\nexample. Starting from do we have a multi account approach to all the\nway down to which execution role is my Lambda using? All of that would\nneed to be so first graph is that it was fun when I did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 34:34\nNot really doing a lot of them anymore, but I will still be championing for\nincorporating infrastructure and configuration into threat modeling\neverywhere I go, I guess. Yeah, so definitely it is so multifaceted. You\u0026rsquo;ve\ngot to look at your access management, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to look at your existing\narchitecture it\u0026rsquo;s sitting on top of you got to look at what the application is\ndoing, which services it\u0026rsquo;s using. You got to look at its perimeter or the\nexisting toolage that it can be using for security, for perimeter protection\npurposes. I make it sound really gloomy. It is definitely possible and fun.\nThere is a lot of guidance right now. It requires sort of pushing threat\nmodeling outside of the generic idea of how we used to do it with Stride,\net cetera. But looking at it more from lower level details and then ongoing\nchecks thereafter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 35:56\nDo you think stride is still the way to go to look at serverless architecture?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 36:03\nIt was an example of a traditional way of approach of freight modeling.\nWhereas when you look at services architecture, not only do we need more\npeople with that knowledge that we don\u0026rsquo;t have enough of, but also a\ndifferent approach to threat modeling. Altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 36:29\nYeah, I think Strive I heard the comment. I think it was Gary Macro who\nmade it. Or Brooke Schunfield. That stride was great if your business was\ncreating operating systems, which is the roots of the methodology in\nMicrosoft. Right. But I find it very limiting when looking at cloud\narchitectures because there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more to consider. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s a nice\nattack library when you\u0026rsquo;re starting and don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do next. And it\nrhymes and it is easy to follow, but it\u0026rsquo;s very limiting and it will not really\nhelp you. And thus perhaps we need to change how we do threat modeling\nas an industry and move a bit away from this simplified model of strife\nbecause it\u0026rsquo;s not really working for the cloud, I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 37:30\nCertainly isn\u0026rsquo;t. And there isn\u0026rsquo;t really a specific framework that I\u0026rsquo;ve come\nacross with or specific approach that completely works because like I said,\nit really depends on what service architecture you are, which cloud you\u0026rsquo;re\non. Right. So now I\u0026rsquo;m working more with Azure. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to switch my\nmind from AWS to Azure. There are many things that are transferable, but\nalso very different things as well. And another challenge when you\u0026rsquo;re\nthreat modeling for service architecture is some of the strings that are\nbeing pulled for those configuration. For example, IAM, Role, et cetera,\nmay be centrally managed. So you\u0026rsquo;re looking at not just your app teams,\nbut also platform teams as well who are providing that sort of backbone\nto developers to build upon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 38:29\nSo developers may not even be aware of that sort of threat, let alone you\nexplaining to them, take any action for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 38:40\nSure. One of the challenges, especially at smaller or small companies\nstartups, is they get a crew of developers to create the application and\nthat is fantastic. They are creating something new from the ground up.\nBut then who knows something about the cloud? Who knows how to\ndesign a cloud? So if you tell them about a hub and spoke network\ntopology, they will just look at you with empty eyes and hate you internally,\nright. And tell you that\u0026rsquo;s probably not something I can do. Can I delegate\nthat to someone else? Why don\u0026rsquo;t you do it? That\u0026rsquo;s a big challenge because\nthey know about development but they don\u0026rsquo;t know about the cloud. And\nthen this knowledge impedes creating the right thing. So they might come\nto very wild ideas and want to open SSH for the VMs, if they have VMs to\nthe outer world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 39:43\nBecause how do you then log in and you tell them, hey, there\u0026rsquo;s passing\nhost and there\u0026rsquo;s VNet and pairing. And they\u0026rsquo;re like, I don\u0026rsquo;t have time for\nthat, I have to do business value. You\u0026rsquo;re just slowing me down. That\u0026rsquo;s not\nhow we do things here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 39:57\nCan you guys hear me okay? I\u0026rsquo;ve stopped at service, actually. And by the\nway, Aisha, you are so spot on with infrastructure. Don\u0026rsquo;t lose that bone.\nRight? That is absolutely critical, right? Keep on that one. I think there\u0026rsquo;s a\ncouple of parts here, right? I think there\u0026rsquo;s the part of understanding the\nenvironment, understanding what are we looking at, right? And I think\nthat\u0026rsquo;s more binary, right? It\u0026rsquo;s like visibility. Do you understand it? Do you\nknow it? And the nice thing of serverless is, I would say standardized a\ncouple of layers, if you think about it, right? If you compare, for example,\nserverless with other architectures, by definition they are other\narchitectures, right? You might have a net framework, a spring\nframework, this framework, that framework, this thing, an EC two\ninstance running a Kubernetes, all those flavors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 40:44\nThe good news of Kubernetes is that lambda, it normalized a number of\nthings that exist. And I actually think that what\u0026rsquo;s missing a bit in our\nindustry is a couple of templates. Like you were saying, you\u0026rsquo;re saying,\nlook, we know that in lambda functions, this bit is provided by the\ninfrastructure. But you need to look at that. You need to look at this. You\nneed to look at this, right? I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of chain thread models, almost\nlike and threat modeling is by layer, where you almost say, for example, in\na way, you should do a threat model of your hello world lambda, right?\nLike, if you take the hello world environment in a particular deployment,\nwhat does it look like? What threads do you have? Because you might get\na whole lot of threads already, a lot of risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 41:27\nJust by the way it\u0026rsquo;s configured, right? By the permissions it\u0026rsquo;s given, the\nenvironment is running everything that\u0026rsquo;s sitting next to it. Like you\u0026rsquo;re\nsaying Lou is like, what\u0026rsquo;s next to it? Right? So if I can go from that\nlambda function, this to that, to know that\u0026rsquo;s massive, and that\u0026rsquo;s just\nbefore you add a line of code to it. But the good news is, again, we can do\nthat, right? So we can then say, by the way, this application, if there are\nany server side requests, include vulnerability, for example, it\u0026rsquo;s game over,\nright? Because there\u0026rsquo;s no other protection or it\u0026rsquo;s okay, right? Like it\u0026rsquo;s\nnicely segmented. The Im rule is really locked down. There\u0026rsquo;s not a lot of\nsecrets, et cetera. And you\u0026rsquo;re right, that is specific.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 42:09\nBut on the other hand, I would ask, and I would say that the cloud\nproviders should give us these threat models, or at least we have a\ncommunity driven threat model. And that\u0026rsquo;s the reality. And in fact, it\nshould be vetted by the experts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 42:24\nI mean, you have some of it, right? AWS has a security paper for every\nsingle one of their services, and that is a bit a threat model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 42:33\nNow, it has to be in a threat model structure, right? By the way, this is also\nwhere I think the LLMs will help a lot, because I think they can help us to\nunderstand this and to create customized views of this, right? But we need\nthose layers, we need that analysis. And this goes back to that point.\nVerifying it, right? Like you want the experts to look at that and go yeah,\nthat is correct. That\u0026rsquo;s not correct. For example, if you talk about tricks on\nlambda functions, I would say one of the big gotchas that I don\u0026rsquo;t think a\nlot of developers are aware of, an architect is the fact that the cold start in\na lambda function actually means that you have state between sessions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 43:11\nWhich for me was really weird because I thought the whole point of\nserverless was not to have state between requests. But it\u0026rsquo;s not true, right?\nLike if you start a lambda request and if you start a process and the\nrequest ends and the thing is frozen, but that process will still be there the\nnext time the next lambda invocation, you add a file to disk, guess what?\nThat file will be available the next time it\u0026rsquo;s invocated. So that means state\ncan actually be a massive problem again, depending on your application,\ndepending on what you do. Right, but those are specific. And here\u0026rsquo;s the\nthing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 43:48\nWhen you go from one platform to the other, I always find actually, the\nsecurity documentation to be really good to tell us what actually changed,\nbecause the security crowd tends to ask how it works, what is actually\ngoing on here? Versus sometimes the Dev crowd I can focus more of how\ndoes it work? Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s still python. Oh, I haven\u0026rsquo;t changed my code a lot.\nCool, let\u0026rsquo;s go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 44:08\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 44:08\nIt\u0026rsquo;s either security or Phenops that will have the bird eye view because\nthey want to see exactly how much it costs. What do we have here? And\nsecurity wants to see how is it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 44:20\nSo my point there was that I think there\u0026rsquo;s one element which we need to\nunderstand how it works. And that\u0026rsquo;s what I was saying, that we very align\nwith the tech crowd and the business who also would like that. But like\nyou said, Louis don\u0026rsquo;t have the time, they haven\u0026rsquo;t been given the time. And\nthe reason they haven\u0026rsquo;t been given the time is because they haven\u0026rsquo;t been\nasked or it\u0026rsquo;s not seen as a requirement to deliver and that\u0026rsquo;s the main\nreason why they don\u0026rsquo;t do it. Right. But I think there\u0026rsquo;s the other part of it\nis, once we have that, how do we do security reviews on top of that? And I\nthink strides it\u0026rsquo;s a good one because it\u0026rsquo;s a waste to start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 44:53\nBut the best malls experience I had is when I had teams that would do as\nmuch as they could with stride, with this, with that. And then I would\nreview it, and I find myself being insanely productive because it\u0026rsquo;s almost\nlike they\u0026rsquo;ve done the legwork, they\u0026rsquo;ve done the bits, and all I would find is\nthe blind spots, in a way. I would then use a bit more security experience to\ngo oh, what about this? What about that. The good news is they learned so\nthey wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make the same request again. So it\u0026rsquo;s almost like it was a\ngreat way to feedback, because in a way, it\u0026rsquo;s almost it didn\u0026rsquo;t matter if in\nthe beginning they missed some threads. What matter was that they got\nthe documentation, they got the structure, they got the flow, they did a\nfirst pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 45:31\nAnd you know what happened in the end, which I found really funny? I\nbecame a voice of reason, which is really weird for me, because they will\ngo over the top, right? So suddenly they will have these massive threats\nabout a gui that\u0026rsquo;s not random enough. And I was like, Right, guys, went\nfrom Incremental 12345 to guides, right? Okay, right. But it\u0026rsquo;s interesting\nbecause then again, developers and sometimes security crowd, they can be\nquite binary, right? But that was great because then we get to define the\nrisk appetite, okay? And also we can find standards of how we want things\nto happen, right? But then we need to collaborate a lot more. And I still\nthink that and this is I go back to my LLM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 46:19\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like if what you do is a prompt with data, with the output that you\nverify, we can now share those LLMs. We can share that prompt. And\nthose prompts are important because there\u0026rsquo;s an art form in how to create\nthat. But imagine, like, even know when you\u0026rsquo;re describing I was imagining\na prompt. I was imagining a prompt, which is right here is Louis first five\nquestions for a dev team. And then you can see that to a bot, and you go,\nhey, guys, can you talk to Louis bot? Lewis threat modeling bot, right? And\nthat has your first five questions. And then imagine you\u0026rsquo;re taking that, and\nthen that create a nice view for you. And then you\u0026rsquo;re reviewing that and\nyou go, oh, okay, guys, can you ask another five questions here, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 47:04\nSo that allows you to scale a lot more and allows, in a way, your team to\nscale a lot more. True.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 47:12\nI mean, take my money, where do I buy it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 47:17\nBut we\u0026rsquo;re not that far. This is what I think is cool, right? The reason I\u0026rsquo;m so\nexcited about LLMs these days is because forget about all the other crap,\nright? That has tons of problems. But this is real. This already works\ntoday. And in fact, the Chat GBT that we have, and Claude Too and\nCopilot, they already do this really well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 47:42\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s interesting. Can I ask Copilot to create a data flow diagram\nof a project you can GD code?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 47:53\nWell, the thing about this, you have to understand how they work, right?\nBecause you have to understand the context window. Does that make\nsense when I say that is what you put in the middle, right? And that\u0026rsquo;s\nlimited. So they cheat. They don\u0026rsquo;t cheat. What they do is they do an ounce\nof analysis and then they feed that in. So you can totally go to Chat GPT\nor Copilot and say, here\u0026rsquo;s a bit of code, give me an architecture diagram,\ngive me in fact, the latest visual element of Chat GPT is awesome because\nyou can now do a fucking diagram, right? And then going, Boy, dude,\nanalyze this. And you can say, hey, does this match the code right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 48:32\nInherently doing it? Or is it like a plugin that you\u0026rsquo;d have to use for the\ndiagrams? Because I\u0026rsquo;ve not tried that one before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 48:39\nSo Chat GBT, they annoyingly only well, they\u0026rsquo;ve been doing that for a\nwhile, but well, at least in UK, where I am, it got released a couple of days\nago, four or five days ago. So if you go to Chat GBT, well, you need to use\nthe paid version, which you should invoice your company, right? That\u0026rsquo;s\nwhat I always tell my team, right? But the paid version had the advanced\ndata analytics, which is pretty awesome, by the way, if you guys haven\u0026rsquo;t\nused that. Again, that is pretty insane, right? The data analytics, where it\nwrites a lot of the code, you can ask all sorts of cool questions and\nvisualizations, but the second part is they just added the ability to upload\nan image. So you can literally upload that\u0026rsquo;s what that guy was doing, that\ndude that was doing thread modeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 49:18\nI think one of the persons, like, you upload an image, a diagram, and then\nyou start to connect from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 49:25\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the one I saw. I found the potential exciting. If I were working for\nEU\u0026rsquo;s Risk, I could be a bit scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 49:33\nWell, they need to leverage it, right? Like, this is the thing, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 49:37\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a chance and it\u0026rsquo;s a threat, right? With two s. Either they are caught by\nit or they cut with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 49:45\nA lot of this I did a presentation yesterday, which I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing recently. I\nsaid, look, you should be panicking and be very excited at the same time.\nAnd if you\u0026rsquo;re not, you\u0026rsquo;re going to be like Nokia, right? Like Blockbuster,\nright? The only difference is going to happen faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 50:03\nDefinitely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 50:06\nThat\u0026rsquo;s exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 50:07\nNow, the companies, especially big companies, are risk averse and new\ntechnologies excite many people. But then it falls to us in the security\ndepartment to do the risk and compliance analysis and determine whether\nthe risk or the use is more or less for the company, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 50:28\nSo we pushed a policy, by the way, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to open source, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad\nto share it. We pushed a policy that fundamentally said don\u0026rsquo;t connect with\nthe outside world yet, because the prompts we don\u0026rsquo;t really control, but for\ninternal use and internal workflows, don\u0026rsquo;t put any personal data on it and\nit\u0026rsquo;s okay. And this was Chat GBT, so we actually about to push and update\nthat policy because we\u0026rsquo;re now devopsing our policies, right? So we\u0026rsquo;re\nputting an update to our policy where we\u0026rsquo;re actually saying, if you\u0026rsquo;re\nusing OpenAI or if you\u0026rsquo;re using AWS bedrock, you can start to put,\nespecially if you can control the region where it goes. So you can start to\nuse it. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think most of the use case we needs a lot of advanced\ncases. It\u0026rsquo;s just people learning how to use it, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 51:12\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 51:15\nDefinitely. Everyone needs to learn how to use it because it changes how\nyou interact with machines, right? But the question is, right now everyone\nwants to use it and then someone has to do the analysis and someone has\nto determine the risk and the policy needs to reflect this. And yes, it\u0026rsquo;s what\nyou\u0026rsquo;re saying, Dennis, definitely. And it\u0026rsquo;s also the fine print.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 51:40\nIn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 51:40\nThe terms and conditions of the AI companies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 51:45\nAnd by the way, if you do a threat model on chat CPT or prompts from the\noutside world, it\u0026rsquo;s ridiculous, right? Like went from having raw SQL, to\nhaving people concatenating strings, to having parameterized queries hey,\ncool, right? At least some level of security, to now prompt engineering,\nwhich is like SQL injection on fucking steroids, right? Because in principle\nyou can modify the whole behavior of it, right? And that problem is not\nsolved because we don\u0026rsquo;t understand the layers. In fact, I had an amazing\nconversation yesterday where were talking about what happens if you\ntrain a model with data, right? Customer data, right? And this is a DPO,\nright? But then you do an erasure, right? So now you need to go and\nremove the data for that user from your model. You can\u0026rsquo;t, right? Exactly,\nright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 52:34\nYou need to retrain the model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 52:35\nYou need to retrain the whole model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 1 - 52:37\nRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 52:37\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s why I was kind of saying that I think the future of this is\nactually to have highly specialized models who have reason, and then the\ndata is what we feed into it. That\u0026rsquo;s the difference. And that\u0026rsquo;s why when I\nwas saying about the code, it\u0026rsquo;s like you have the raw code, imagine chant,\nGPT analysis or whatever of each one will give us this value and then that\nanalysis gives us the next one, and then the next one, and the next one.\nAnd as you go up this way, you start to get the bigger picture, right? You\nstart to understand the method view. But we can do architectural\ndiagrams on every single layer here, right? And the beauty of this is that\nyou can be here and you can say, oh, let me feed the infrastructure view,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 53:18\nLet me feed the business view here. In the past, this was impossible. That\u0026rsquo;s\nwhy people didn\u0026rsquo;t figure out how to do it, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 53:25\nThat\u0026rsquo;s easier to control when you want to centralized in a centralized way.\nHighly specialized decoupled solutionizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 53:38\nAnd serverless is actually an interesting example because the problem\nspace is smaller. Like for example, Lewis, imagine the scenario just talked\nabout to say, look, you should be using IAM policies IAM groups IMS for\nservice to server communication instead of passwords. We can now go\nfrom a mode where imagine I can train a bot or give a prompt that is\nfocused on that I can train a bot to say, your job is to find this. If you find\nthis, here\u0026rsquo;s our guidance, here\u0026rsquo;s the technical documentation of how to do\nit, provide information to the dev of how to do that transition and the\ntests. So that prompt I just said, it would have been millions of pounds of\nengineering to pull off. Now it\u0026rsquo;s realistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 54:25\nAre you talking about like remediating it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 54:27\nActually, yeah. So this is where you can go from almost identifying to\nremediation, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 54:33\nYeah. So imagine I\u0026rsquo;ll give you another use case. It\u0026rsquo;s already possible with\nAWS, for example, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about lambdas, right? So you give an\nexecution role to lambda, which can be an IAM role. It can be as\npermissive as you want. So one of the best practices and secure way of\ndoing it is not allowing it like an admin level permission. And AWS has this\nservice that they also provide, which is it runs the lambda, does exactly\nwhat it carries out the execution, sees what it\u0026rsquo;s doing, tells you exactly\nwhat to include in the permission policy. That\u0026rsquo;s how you can formulate the\nrole. So you can get that entire process automated and implemented with\nno impact on the application at all because you know what it needs to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 55:26\nAnd if you train a bot to provide that, it can have guidance, it knows what\ninputs to get. So a really crazy feature which is really good on chat DBT is\nability to have functions. So you can say, here\u0026rsquo;s an API that depending on\nthe analysis, can give you the functions to call. So you can have a prompt\nthat eventually go, oh, now can you go and get me the change in IAM\npolicy? So the bot can now even start to react with live data and then say,\noh, actually, no, sorry, that configuration you made actually didn\u0026rsquo;t make\nan effect or is going to have this problem or blah, blah, blah. So there\u0026rsquo;s a\nlevel of intelligence that in the past we couldn\u0026rsquo;t do, that we can do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 56:10\nI think we in fact, the next session, which we\u0026rsquo;re going to have, by the way,\nyou guys should join because me and Sarah are going to do it. But I think\nit\u0026rsquo;s very relevant to what we are doing here, which know the chat GBT\ngen AI privacy, right, which is I think is a massive uncertainty, but I also\nthink it\u0026rsquo;s a massive opportunity because I think we can now do privacy\nanalysis that in the past was impossible because we couldn\u0026rsquo;t scale. So I\nthink it\u0026rsquo;s, again, one of those two angles. So, any final comments and\nnotes on the serverless since we\u0026rsquo;re just finishing this one off?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 4 - 56:47\nNo comments. It\u0026rsquo;s been really lovely talking to you. It\u0026rsquo;s really informative\nas well. So I\u0026rsquo;m definitely going to clear up sometime tomorrow to look up\nthe data analytics GPT site. I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to join, but I\u0026rsquo;ll watch the\nrecording, so it sounds really interesting. Nice chat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 57:06\nSo from my side tomorrow we\u0026rsquo;ll be doing another session on threat model\nin Qatar. We\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at a serverless architecture this time so as to put\ninto practice what I\u0026rsquo;ve been saying. Now, you\u0026rsquo;ve picked my curiosity and\nthis not being a work system, but a play system I just invented. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll\ntry to get something from Chattypt and perhaps even fail. Live tomorrow\non that, but let\u0026rsquo;s see how that goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 2 - 57:34\nCool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 3 - 57:35\nI\u0026rsquo;ll join in, help you with that.

We have\nLewis who is going to talk about a really cool concept and a really\ninteresting merging of different practices where he\u0026rsquo;s going to take us over\non how to use the CATA concepts around threat modeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 00:19\nSo, Louis, over to you. Thank you very much, Dennis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 00:23\nSo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 00:24\nYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 00:25\nMy name is Louis Serving. I\u0026rsquo;m a cybersecurity architect, and since\nMonday I may call myself platform security lead at a company in\nHamburg, Germany. In this case I\u0026rsquo;m talking about things. In my\nexperience, my employer knows nothing about it, and I\u0026rsquo;m not saying they\nendorse me in any way. This is just flexing our threat modeling muscles\nbetween friends, and I hope everyone in the meeting is willing to\nparticipate. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make a presentation as such. I want to have a\nworking dialogue with anyone in the call that feels like participating. Of\ncourse, me, I have been doing threat modeling for nowadays about over\nten years. I have no idea when exactly I started, but it was around 2011,\n2012. I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at the aerospace systems, automotive systems, It\nsystems, OT systems, IoT and yeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t tweet that often, but still I have\na Twitter account, I mastered an account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:40\nI\u0026rsquo;m all in for infotech, information and exchanging information. I will be\nreferring to my GitHub account. There\u0026rsquo;s a repo there which you can clone\nand from there we can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:58\nJust take it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:59\nOkay, so to get started, what is threat modeling? I like this definition the\nmost from Brooke Schunfield. Threat modeling is a technique to identify\nthe attacks a system must resist and the defenses that will bring the system\nto its higher defensive state. As you see in the definition, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing\nsaying it has to be, and it is about understanding the system. We have\nunderstanding situation and understanding its particular threat exposure.\nAs usual, threat modeling is a four step process. You model the system,\nthat is, you try to understand scope and understand scope, and then model\nthe system, which means you basically draw a nice diagram. You analyze\nthe threats, trying to identify and document vulnerabilities and threat\nscenarios that affect these vulnerabilities. Of course, the most important\naspect of all of this is mitigation and validating the outcome. So that\u0026rsquo;s all I\nhave to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 03:08\nThreat modeling, kata, are we going to apply it? Feel free to make any\ncomments, any questions on the chat. I\u0026rsquo;ll ask Dennis to maybe open the\nsession in a second for everyone to participate freely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 03:29\nYeah, I\u0026rsquo;ll keep an eye on the chat and anybody asks questions and I\u0026rsquo;ll\nbring people in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 03:34\nThank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 03:36\nSo kata is very nice symbol. Well, there\u0026rsquo;s actually two symbols, but I\u0026rsquo;d.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 03:40\nLike to one more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 03:41\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a Japanese word which means form. There\u0026rsquo;s like several words that\nare pronounced kata, but this candy in particular refers to form and it\u0026rsquo;s\nbasically, if you have ever done karate or other martial arts, it\u0026rsquo;s a\nrepetition of movements. It\u0026rsquo;s the choreography, if you want to call it that\nway, of movements. You can do the kata by yourself or you can do the\nkata in a group. The idea is that you train your body to move in a certain\nway. You train your muscle to create what is called muscle memory, so that\nthe movements feel natural. I was doing karate many years ago, when I\nwas doing karate many years ago as a child, I remember spending about\nhalf the time of the karate lesson doing qatar. There\u0026rsquo;s a question by\nconsole where does the concept of risk comes in as we perform threat\nmodeling?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 04:44\nIt could be around here. When you analyze the threat, so when you\nanalyze the threats, you have a vulnerability, you have a actually, I have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 04:54\nA presentation on that topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 04:56\nI was not planning on showing you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 04:59\nThat slide, but I can show it, of course. Give me 1 second, if I can very\nquickly open it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 05:10\nThat will make the concept threat modeling kata.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 05:13\nA lot easier to understand. Give me 1 second and I\u0026rsquo;ll have it ready for you.\nOkay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 05:32\nIn terms of risk management or risk assessment, threat modeling fits in\nthis way. We speak of systems which are our assets. Assets have value I can\neither assume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 05:51\nOr use the pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 05:53\nI\u0026rsquo;m very sorry for that. An asset has the value, the more value you have,\nthe higher the risk. Because of the impact, assets might exhibit\nvulnerabilities. The more critical vulnerability, the higher your risk. Or\neven the presence of a critical vulnerability might lead to an increased\nrisk. In an attempt to curtail risk, companies induce policies to try to\nreduce the risk exposure, which basically mandate controls, at least the\ntechnical policies. The controls might help protect, detect, respond, or\nrecover from a given threat scenario. For threat scenarios elicitation\nwithin threat modeling, we can speak of stripe, linden, attack trees,\nattachment, pasta, whatever you want to do, but these are usual threat\nscenarios. The question for me for creating a credible attack vector is\nthere has to be a threat agent attached to a threat scenario which is in\ncontact with a vulnerability for there to be a risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 07:09\nJust having a vulnerability with no way to exploit it basically means there\nis a very low risk because of the chances of it happening. I hope controller,\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how to pronounce your name, sorry. That answers your\nquestion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 07:32\nActually, can you post that question? Because I think he sent it directly to\nyou, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 07:37\nYes, directly to me. So sorry for that. Let me copy paste it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 07:44\nTo everyone in the chat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 07:46\nSo that was the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 07:50\nConsole, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 07:51\nYes, console, I\u0026rsquo;ll make you co host.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 07:55\nOh, michael is here. Hey, Michael, I also made you a co host. Feel free to\nchip in right. Cassell, you can unmute if you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael - 08:06\nYeah, thanks reason why I asked that question is I think a lot of times\nwhen you walk within 1st, 2nd, 3rd line the conversation of risk becomes a\nproblem. We are coming from third line perspective without really\nunderstanding the threats right? Because a lot of times from a first line\nperspective, the folks on first line, they implement the controls and all that\nstuff. You come to them and tell them there is a risk itself without really\nbeing able to articulate what the threats are, what the trade scenarios are,\nbecomes a problem to drive that need to remediation. That\u0026rsquo;s kind of the\nreason why I was asking that question though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 08:45\nDefinitely. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons I tried to do threat modeling in a bit\ndifferent way than Shostek has made famous or Microsoft before. Shostak\nhas made famous with Stripe. Actually, I\u0026rsquo;m more of the Church of\nschunfield, if you want to think of it that way. Or the philosophy branch of\nSchunfield rather than Schustuck, in which he speaks of the concept of the\ncredible attack vector, which is basically the same thing I just mentioned.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just explained in a different way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 09:20\nWhich is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 09:21\nYou have a threat agent with skilled motivation, resources, risk tolerance,\nan exploit so an active action, then a path that puts the vulnerability in\ncontact with the exploit and the threat agent. That leads to a cradle attack\nvector, which then you can measure in money impact and probability of\noccurrence based on all these three or four elements existing. In the past I\nhave tried to match this within the automotive company I was working I\ncould not call it risk management but I did create a likelihood assessment\nbased on these things and then an impact assessment based on the\ntechnical impact, not the monetary impact. The impact to the mission that\nwas a cheap way to get out of the political conundrum that makes of who\nowns the Isms in the company. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if that helps answer your\nquestion console?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael - 10:26\nNo, sure it does. Thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 10:28\nOn this graph Louis is also a case where for example before or after an\nexploit or even the thread agents there\u0026rsquo;s a direct correlation with the risk\nright? Because like you said there so the higher the threat agents that you\nsee, the higher the risk goes. Right, but also once they exploit also the risk\nincreases, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 10:52\nYeah, I would say so having more threat agents who are in the capacity of\nexploiting generating this threat scenario increases your exposure because\nthe probability increases. If we split the world in three or four categories\nwe have amateurs that work on by their own then you have a consortium\nof amateurs that might help each other and then you have the NSA, right,\nor the Mossad or the nation state. If your only attack agent, threat agent\nis the Mossad or nation state, it depends on what you\u0026rsquo;re building. Right. If\nyou\u0026rsquo;re building weapon systems, you have to protect against them. If you\nmaybe not, but if my 13 year old nephew can hack your system, you\u0026rsquo;re\nreally in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 11:48\nThat\u0026rsquo;s important because it allows you to start focus more on the risks\nthat are exploitable by the threat agents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 11:54\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 11:55\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the ones that you should be priced. That\u0026rsquo;s the ones I really want to\nmake sure they\u0026rsquo;re hard to exploit or that you have enough visibility right\ninto what\u0026rsquo;s going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 12:02\nOf course, you cannot take the threat agents away. What you can do is\nbasically cut this exploitation. If you\u0026rsquo;re able to take away the vulnerability,\nit\u0026rsquo;s fantastic. If you\u0026rsquo;re able to get them not to be in contact with the\nvulnerability anymore and you can just cut this access, they can still be\nthere, they can still try to exploit it, they just won\u0026rsquo;t be able to reach it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 12:31\nExactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 12:34\nNot everything in the security controls that you propose is about cutting\naccess to or impeding the vulnerability from succeeding. Sometimes you\ncan just cut the weight to the vulnerability and you can buy yourself some\ntime to patch or do something else about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 12:51\nOkay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 12:54\nRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 12:56\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 12:57\nAny comments, questions on that? Let\u0026rsquo;s get to the fun part. We just saw\nthe concept of the Qatar and then the concept of the architectural Qatar.\nNow if you want the threat modeling kata, so there\u0026rsquo;s new words, I don\u0026rsquo;t\nknow when exactly, because I\u0026rsquo;ve been hearing about architectural Qatars\nfor at least like five to seven years, based himself on the work of Dave\nThomas. Dave Thomas was one day at the karate practice of his son and\nsaw that they were doing a kata and then decided that he should create\nthis to allow developers to experiment in programming languages, new\nsmall programs that were complete. This concept was taken by Tesnor to\ncreate architectural catas. He created a whole website around it,\narchitecturalcatas.com. He keeps all the architectural catas in a\nrepository which can be visited. Give me a second to open it. So this is the\nwebsite from Tetnor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 14:33\nHe has to give you a repo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 14:35\nYeah, this is a repo. Tetnoord, Archkatas, and here are all the catas\ndefined as Jason. Why are they defined as Jason? Because you can go then\nto his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 14:47\nWebsite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 14:49\nClick on the Roulette and basically you get one description of Akata. The\nidea is that you can make an after work party like we\u0026rsquo;re doing, have\nperhaps one or several groups of colleagues or friends and just give them\na CATA each and then give them an hour to build it up or design it and\nthen come back and show to everyone else what they did. In that sense, I\nwas looking for something that was taking my interest and I chose one\nabout the grading system. So I\u0026rsquo;ll present that in a second. Just wanted to\nshow the site again, I am referring to my GitHub repo. This we could\ngladly host the OSS repo as well or in the organization OSS if you have, if\nI can. Basically what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to do is create here resources for the cat\nthat I\u0026rsquo;m doing. This is the second cat that I do and the most important\nthing here is the setup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 16:08\nIf you want to follow along, I\u0026rsquo;ll copy this into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 16:17\nThe chat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 16:19\nThis is really cool. Nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 16:22\nI just lost the chat. Where\u0026rsquo;s the chat? Could anyone type hello, I\u0026rsquo;m trying\nto find the chat. Oh, there\u0026rsquo;s, sorry for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 16:34\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s the repo. I have to push the latest commits I\u0026rsquo;ve done to the repo.\nI try to organize it so that we can have a clean slate to start right now.\nBasically what I\u0026rsquo;m saying is I\u0026rsquo;m giving you instructions on how to do this.\nThe most important thing is install Vs code, install a graph based plugin\nand if you copy paste this Jason, you can just follow along as I do it, but\nyou don\u0026rsquo;t have to do it, you can just watch and enjoy the show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 17:16\nSo that graphics, which one is it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 17:20\nJason? Jason is called so this is just for dot files, which is the graphics\nformat, the shortcut, the user created settings. Give me 1 second to show\nyou how it looks like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 17:37\nThere it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 17:41\nIf I go to file so you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 17:44\nUse yes code to create the I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 17:47\nUse Vs code, but it could be anything. Actually this is an idea I snapped\nfrom Udnus long time ago you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 17:53\nTalked about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 17:56\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if everyone was able to follow So file settings or preferences.\nSorry, user snippets configure user snippets and I choose graphics for the\none I have and this opens this file here called dot JSON.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 18:13\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t choose the name, so it\u0026rsquo;s horrible. Let me close this and let me close\nthat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 18:21\nHere basically I have templates that allow me to create nice looking\ndiagrams without spreading it. So it\u0026rsquo;s all there. Just take it while I talk and\npresent the case. Maybe you can set up your environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 18:37\nHow do you render this on the escape?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 18:40\nI render it with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 18:45\nA second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 18:51\nSo, I have installed the graphics preview. This one is the one I like to use\nfrom F and Z-H-I installed that one and I installed all the preface methods,\nbut I always installed them together graphics language support and that\nbasically allows me to create a diagram from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 19:15\nThe graphics second diagram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 19:23\nOh, this is from the threat model link had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 19:25\nOkay, yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s a good point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 19:26\nBasically I have my graphics dot files created this way and I hit on the\nmagnifying glass and I get the context diagram and the container\ndiagram. I\u0026rsquo;ll get into the details right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 19:42\nCool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 19:43\nThis is just to help you set up your environment because we\u0026rsquo;ll be working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 19:46\nWith it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 19:51\nAs a matter of how I like to diagram. I don\u0026rsquo;t like DFDS as Microsoft and\nShastak have promoted these circles and lines with no context. I really\ndespise them because they are very security specific. Developers cannot\nstart anything with them and who owns the file, no one feels responsible\nfor it except for the security person, so no one updates it. Actually\ndocumentation of the architecture is something that should happen as the\narchitecture is being created. I look for software architects to find a way\non how to best do it. The best I have found so far is the simple model\ndiagram definition or context, if you want to call it that way. From Simon\nBrown. He divides the world in four C\u0026rsquo;s context, container, component and\ncode. Meaning context is the system and the world around it. Container\ndeployable units, not docker containers. Component is when you zoom in\nand you have different things talking within a deployable unit and then\ncode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 21:05\nI have never had to diagram the code myself. There\u0026rsquo;s always a way to\ndiagram the code if you ever need it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 21:10\nRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 21:11\nThe most important thing is everything has to have a label. The diagram,\nthe elements, the edges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 21:18\nBe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 21:18\nConsistent in the colors you use. I\u0026rsquo;m using gray for out of scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 21:22\nAnd blue for in scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 21:25\nEach node in the graph needs to have its purpose and characteristics, the\nedge, the lines between the nodes demonstrate the intent and try to keep it\nshort, not to overburden. Basically the idea is I have the system, its users\nand third party dependent system. I zoom into this green square and I\nhave my container, my deployable unit. Within the deployable unit, there\u0026rsquo;s\nusually one thing that really does magic and that\u0026rsquo;s the one that maybe you\nwant to zoom in further. If you zoom into one of these boxes, you basically\nhave code. Again, I could basically make a line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 22:14\nSorry for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 22:16\nI would make a line here on the level I usually go for threat model. If I\never have to go deeper than that, I ask directly for the code and how\nthey\u0026rsquo;re implementing that. Usually I do this for input validation and JSON\nweb token validation when I want to make sure that they\u0026rsquo;re really doing\nwhat they\u0026rsquo;re telling me to do. Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:41\nI think this is also a great way to sometimes avoid mixing context and\nmaking sure that the elements stay at the right altitude or else sometimes\nyou have some threat models that mix things in the middle of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 22:54\nRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:55\nThis allows you to each one leads to the next one, right, which is actually\nquite cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 23:00\nWell, while I was this automotive company, I had a big number of software\narchitects or security architects that were doing threat modeling. More\noften than not, I had a network diagram that actually tells you nothing\nabout the application because it stops at layer four. Yeah, so that\u0026rsquo;s a\nproblem I have with EFTs. They usually stop at layer four. If you want to\nmake them more detailed, you get such a big diagram, it\u0026rsquo;s very confusing.\nWhereas here you can basically pick every one of these containers, tear it\napart, and create a separate diagram for every one of these containers.\nFor every one of these components, you can still zoom in at different\nlayers and then you can always separate them very well. I rather have this\nkind of diagramming which is created as code, which can live in the kit\nrepository together with the code, so that now the developers don\u0026rsquo;t need\nto go out of their IDE to create, enhance, or update the diagram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 24:12\nThere\u0026rsquo;s no excuse not to do it. The problem with using Figma or Draw I O\nwith the web version, of course, is that you have to go outside and do it\nand you have to use a Gui. Sometimes you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use a Gui.\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s just, as a developer, a lot easier to type. Fill in three things,\nmake a line and that\u0026rsquo;s it. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 24:36\nWhere do you store these files? Do you put them on the GitHub repos? I\nthink you mentioned a bit about ownership. Where do you put them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 24:43\nUsually when I engage with the developers, I try to get access to their\nrepo. If they have a slash docs, I put it right there. Docs images or slash\ndocs architectural diagram. And then the thread model. The report is a\nmatter of where.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 25:02\nYou want to put it. Yeah, cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 25:09\nMichael is asking about TFT boundaries and where do you enforce the\ncontrols? I ask you to be patient. I will show you that this is just a matter\nof diagramming and agreeing on how we\u0026rsquo;re going to do it. All right, so\nlet\u0026rsquo;s start with our Qatar. The Qatar is called. Make the grade. Basically\nwe have, I mean, this is very US. Centric, probably, but still fun. A very\nlarge and popular state would like a new system to support standardized\ntesting across public school systems, grades three through twelve. We have\n40,000 plus students, 2000 graders, and 50 administrators. Okay, so far so\ngood. Perfect requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 26:03\nYes, sir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 26:05\nStudents will only be able to use the application within testing centers\naround the state. The application will only be used within testing centers.\nMost of them will be in schools, but not all of them. Students should be\nable to take a test and the results eventually consolidated. Sorry, I\u0026rsquo;m not a\nvery good underliner. To a single location representing all of the test\nscores across the state by school teacher and student. Just by looking at\nthis, we have perhaps a huge problem with Pai data tests will be multiple\nchoice, short answer and essay. The system should have reporting the\nsystem should have a reporting system to know which students have taken\nthe test and what score they received. Now, the question here is, who is\nseeing these reports? Who has access to these reports? Every school\ndirector, every school teacher getting a report of which students have\ntaken it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 27:16\nOr is the state or I have no idea how the US. Separates states into\ncounties. I think is the county marshal or the county education person the\none that received this report? So it\u0026rsquo;s not quite clear here. Of course, it\u0026rsquo;s\nmultiple answer questions, but there\u0026rsquo;s also short answers with sentences\nand essay questions that will be graded by teachers, and the teachers will\nthen ask the essay grades to assist. To be honest, that\u0026rsquo;s a great question,\nMiguel. I have no idea whether a student will be able to take a single test.\nI assume that they will take a test. As standardized tests are, I suppose\nthey will take one math test, one English test, and one something test. I\nhave no idea whether they will all be put together in the same exam or\nthey have to show up three different days for three different exams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 28:25\nI have no idea how this works, but let\u0026rsquo;s assume it\u0026rsquo;s one test for the subject\nthat needs to be assessed. This is something that we can define, right? So\nthese are the business requirements. We, as the system designers and then\nthreat modelers, basically decide all questions that are not quite here. The\nlast thing for context is a change approval process involving three\ndifferent government agencies is required for changes to the way student\ngrades are kept to ensure security. The state does not own its hosting\ncenter, but outsources it to a third party. The project must defend its\nbudget every fiscal year. Basically, don\u0026rsquo;t get hacked, don\u0026rsquo;t make a scandal,\nand you might be able to. And don\u0026rsquo;t mess up records. Don\u0026rsquo;t be in the news.\nYou would be able to keep your budget, I assume. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep the\nrequirements at hand, and then I\u0026rsquo;ll probably switch the screen so that I\u0026rsquo;m\nable to see it directly so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 29:34\nAny questions, any comments to this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 29:41\nCool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 29:41\nNothing? All right, we lost your screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 29:45\nAre you going to show I know. I\u0026rsquo;m switching screens because I had the\nsecondary screen with the presentation, but I want to show my DS code on\nthe main screen, and for that, I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 30:00\nNeed to switch modeling and share my screen. How can how do I increase\nthe size here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 30:34\nI hope you could set up your system. I will create a new file for threat\nmodeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 30:44\nLet me create a new directory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 30:48\nFor this session. So I will call this session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 30:59\nAnd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 30:59\nInside Grace data, I will create the context diagram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 31:13\nOkay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 31:13\nSo with that, I can start using.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 31:15\nThe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 31:25\nThis is part of the JSON file that I told you in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 31:28\nThe beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 31:31\nI need to change the.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 31:35\nHow do I change setting preferences?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 31:38\nSorry I\u0026rsquo;ll change the font to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 31:40\nIt easier to read setting accelerator font make it really huge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 32:01\nIs that readable anyone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:06\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a bit small can you make it bigger?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 32:08\nStill a bit small okay, let me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 32:09\nMake it bigger of course is it readable? Yes okay, thank you for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 32:30\nOkay, so basically I have created a graph. I will call it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 32:36\nContext Title. This is the system context diagram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 32:58\nI want to see how I create it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 33:01\nSo far so good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 33:05\nAnd I start with the first entity. I will put my system in the center. I will put\nit without an image because we don\u0026rsquo;t have any icon for it. So we\u0026rsquo;ll call it\ngrading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 33:28\nOh, come on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 33:34\nAs you see as I type graph is this graph is plugging is updating the\ndiagram it\u0026rsquo;s a.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 33:44\nTask solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 33:48\nDescription of purpose so here I would define basically what we had in the\nQatar where I have it sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 34:04\nMr. Kata.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 34:08\nSo here I have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 34:12\nSo we have the test. It allows students to take tests trades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 34:27\nUnder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 34:30\nTesting platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 34:36\nSince this is HTML, I have to do it this way. It\u0026rsquo;s a standardized platform\nsetting platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 34:55\nServes with students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 35:04\nAllows teachers to grade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 35:10\nLong form answers, provide results to I forgot. Provides quick results to\nmultiple choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 35:45\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s the first one. So that\u0026rsquo;s my creating system. This is the first\ndecision that I take. I say this thing is within a.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 35:54\nCluster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 35:58\nI will put it in AWS. This is an AWS instance. And AWS is my cloud service\nprovider. Since I came to this large idea a bit late, I have to move\neverything up there so give me 1 second don\u0026rsquo;t discourage if it disappears.\nNow, Miguel, you were asking about the context. There you have it. I have\nmy dotted line things in execution environment and when we think about\nit. We were told that students will be taking this in test centers which\nhappen to be school, but not exclusively. They could be something else.\nNow we have another type of diagram. So we have another cluster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 36:54\nThis cluster is cool. This is a system center located in a cool and here I am\ngoing to have students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 37:18\nThe beauty of having this thing is that it has already predefined fields\nwhich you can tap into them and start filling them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 37:27\nSo this is a student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 37:31\nThe path is images person PNG so there you have it. We have our student,\nit\u0026rsquo;s a person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 37:43\nThis is a PC in computer lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 37:53\nI have no idea what kind of PCs they will be using but I assume that if\nthey\u0026rsquo;re using schools it\u0026rsquo;s because they already have an infrastructure with\na PC lab or computing lab with PCs where they will be doing the test. And\nwhat is this person doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 38:13\nThis is a student sitting to take an exam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 38:24\nOkay, now we have something very similar in this case, it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 38:33\nIsn\u0026rsquo;T out. I will call it in exactly same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 38:50\nI have to move it to a different path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 38:52\nSorry for that. Images person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 39:00\nAnd the type is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 39:06\nUnspecified location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 39:10\nWe have no idea where this location would be. And again, this is the\nstudent seeking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 39:16\nTo take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 39:20\nAnd again, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 39:22\nI was too fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 39:27\nBecause this should logically be another cluster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 39:31\nSo this is a cluster out, this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 39:37\nIs another testing center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 39:42\nWhich is not a school. Here I want it to have this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 39:52\nMiguel, as you see I have or Michael, sorry, as you see I have now two\nstudents, one grading system. Now I need to connect them together. So\nlet\u0026rsquo;s say student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 40:07\nIs interacting with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 40:11\nIn C four. There\u0026rsquo;s ways to simplify that code, right? Because you could\nconvert that into functions, right with the Plant UML, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 40:20\nPerhaps you could if you use Plant UML. I don\u0026rsquo;t use plant. UML to be\nhonest, I always use graphics because it\u0026rsquo;s relatively easy to read. I mean\nright now it\u0026rsquo;s too small and too tight and then you cannot read it but plan\nyour mail creating huge Java thing, it\u0026rsquo;s harder to follow through what\u0026rsquo;s\ngoing on. Yeah, I find at least in my experience of course not everyone\nwants to write this by hand, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 40:48\nThat means the system is called Craving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 40:57\nNow I have the student talking to that and then I have the.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 41:01\nOther type of student out who was also talking to Craving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 41:09\nThe thing that I was saying is, okay, we need to specify here how are they\nconnecting, right? Here we say if we have a system that is sending so here\nwe basically have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 41:31\nRetrieves questions from right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 41:38\nThis is following the C four methodology again, so here we retrieve\nquestions from grading system. We read it as a sentence and we also have\nthe case in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 41:52\nWhich we send responses to the creating system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 42:05\nThis is where the threat modeling comes in. How are we connected? Let\u0026rsquo;s\nassume we are connecting with Https. So the connection is kind of secure.\nNow the question here is how are we going to identify so how do we\nprevent spoofing? So Michael was already thinking about spoofing.\nMichael, if you\u0026rsquo;re still there, how could you prevent spoofing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 42:32\nActually, a follow up question to that Louis, is I assume you can break this\ndown further, right? For instance, in the case of AWS, you might think of\nmultiple components eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 42:43\nLet\u0026rsquo;S say you have a microservice container diagram. This is the context\ndiagram. We don\u0026rsquo;t want to jump right into the technical stuff. We just\nwant right now to put the system in the context of its users, in the context\nit. Lives in the world. Just like in Google Maps, you zoom in, we could\ncreate a container diagram in which we start tearing apart our\narchitecture in the cloud and putting all the systems that we have and\nWAF and whether we want to deploy in Kubernetes or in Lambdas or it\u0026rsquo;s\nall open, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 43:22\nYeah, that makes sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 43:24\nThat is just a context. Very often I have found some developers are not\naware of the context the system operates because they\u0026rsquo;re working in this\nsmall knob inside the bowels of the beast, and they have no idea how the\ncontext looks like. You ask them who\u0026rsquo;s your client, who\u0026rsquo;s using your\nsystem? Very often they don\u0026rsquo;t have answer, which means they assume\nthings are happening in some way, but who knows how they\u0026rsquo;re really\nhappening. That\u0026rsquo;s why I like to start with a helicopter view 10 km above\nthe earth and then start zooming in towards the details, rather than start\nright away with the details, because then you\u0026rsquo;re overwhelmed with\ninformation. What we could start seeing here is okay, which is the first\nthreat that we see here. My students what is the motivation of the students\nto not behave correctly? Can anyone think of any threats coming from the\nstudents?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 44:39\nOne thing that I was thinking about is the students, right. So let\u0026rsquo;s say\nthreats now, those coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 44:51\nFrom the students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 44:54\nI think you were saying it at the beginning, Michael poofing. What does\npoofing mean in the context of this person sitting here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 45:09\nYeah, like an A student attempting to make an exam on behalf of\nsomebody else. Let\u0026rsquo;s say my brother, right. He studied, he wanted to do\nthe exam instead of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 45:20\nRight, exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 45:22\nI had thought of the same one. So take an extended one else. Anything else\nyou can think of?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:31\nCan you have extra coms, like a mobile phone or a watch or something\nthat gives them data?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 45:40\nCome again? Could you repeat that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 45:41\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t understand it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:43\nYeah, I think about actually categories. The students, when they take the\nexams, have a mobile phone or a watch that gives them the answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 45:49\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 45:50\nOkay. This is the one I called like telling the questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:56\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 45:58\nAsking charge UPT or something like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:00\nYeah. Can you charge you PT. The thing getting to take the exam is one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 46:09\nSo this one actually has.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 46:16\nTaking pictures of questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 46:17\nThen you also have memorizing questions. It\u0026rsquo;s incredible what young\nminds are capable of in memorization capabilities. What else could you\nthink of taking pictures of questions? And here we have two things, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 46:37\nFor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 46:40\nSelling and the other one would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 46:42\nBe taking pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 46:46\nOf questions for cheating, which means someone or something is giving\nyou the right answer to their question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:55\nDon\u0026rsquo;t you need also to capture the receiving of the data? Right, because\nthat\u0026rsquo;s a bit different. Right, so that\u0026rsquo;s almost like having a feedback loop,\nisn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 47:05\nYeah. This is a lot more exposure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 47:08\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 47:08\nThis is a lot easier to be cut. Whereas this one here is more tedious. Right.\nHide it. Or they take pictures all the time. They have it in the glasses, but\nthey\u0026rsquo;re not actually communicating with anyone. They can still go and\ndump the whole exam for everyone to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 47:26\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 47:28\nMemorizing the questions. What else do we have? Spoofing or reputation,\nmaybe. I don\u0026rsquo;t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 47:35\nIf a student taking an exam in different locations?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 47:42\nYes, why not? So I\u0026rsquo;m selling the questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 47:49\nPending different locations for the exam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 47:56\nReputation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 48:03\nWasn\u0026rsquo;T there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:08\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t them, right? Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 48:10\nThose are not my answers. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaker 5 - 48:17\nThere was a failure during taking the exam or something like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 48:22\nYeah, well, I mean, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t there, right? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. And then the other\none is Reputation. I am pretty sure I answered something else. Now they\nchange it. So there\u0026rsquo;s a mistake in the matrix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 48:38\nRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 48:40\nYeah. So those are not my answers. Would be a reputation attack to the\nsystem. If they don\u0026rsquo;t like the grade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 48:49\nHow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:50\nDo you connect this to the individual elements? Are you going to yeah, we\ncould.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 48:55\nAdd them all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 48:56\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 48:56\nThe idea is not to get it to burden. What I try to achieve with these\ndiagrams is to inherit them to the developing team. Because very often\ndeveloping teams don\u0026rsquo;t have good diagrams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:12\nWell, if you think about it, the ideal situation, this was created actually by\ncode, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 49:19\nYes. You could use the structure actually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:24\nProgrammatically. Yep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 49:32\nSo that could help. So now we have the teacher. Right? I know we\u0026rsquo;re\nrunning almost on the hour, so I\u0026rsquo;ll do the teacher quite fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 49:50\nTeacher, teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 50:01\nTeacher, grader. So they didn\u0026rsquo;t really call them teachers. They called them\ngraders. But I have no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 50:07\nSo grade long form answers, and then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 50:16\nThe teacher is in a very different context. Actually we have no idea where\nthis person is living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 50:21\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 50:21\nWe have the teacher, perhaps in his or her home. We have no idea where\nthis person is located. Could be an employee of the grading system, could\nbe someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 50:34\nTeacher is talking to the grading system. Label locks into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 50:50\nLocks into the grading system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 50:56\nGrade answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 51:05\nWhat else is this person doing? I think that\u0026rsquo;s all we have from the, from\nthe use case. We have systems should have a short answer and say\nquestions will be manually graded by teachers, who will then add the essay\ngrades to the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 51:26\nOkay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 51:27\nThey report the grades now locked into grades answers, and the system\nconsolidates grades. Okay, so we don\u0026rsquo;t have to do that. Now, if we think of\nthe teachers, what could be the incentives of teachers to cheat? So we\nhave here an interesting sentence. Results eventually consolidated to\nallocation representing test scores across the state by school, teacher and\nstudent. I was thinking, what would be the intrinsic motivation for a\nteacher to misbehave. Now, if I\u0026rsquo;m going to be compared to other teachers,\nthere could be an economic incentive. If my class has a better average\ngrade if my school is going to be compared to other schools in the district\nand my school gets a better grade in average, the school might get more\nmoney for the next semester, the next year, whatever period. There\u0026rsquo;s a\nperverse incentive here for the if the teachers are the graders, which is an\nassumption I\u0026rsquo;m making because I don\u0026rsquo;t know where else they would get\n2000 people to create long term answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 52:50\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a perverse incentive to cheat on the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 53:00\nIf you go follow that then you also probably want to put almost the head\nteacher in the school right? Because they might also be involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 53:09\nRight, sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 53:12\nThe problem here is I have no idea what the head teacher is doing. Right,\nnot necessarily mentioned. We do know that they have a reporting\ncapability which I suppose so they have a reporting system which I\nsuppose this person would be consuming. Actually when I was doing this\nby hand during the day, thinking about it, I was thinking about a lot of\nother people which are not mentioned but unfortunately we didn\u0026rsquo;t have\nthe time. We can continue this next time or we can take a different cat\nnext time. Teachers, I just want to put this in writing and commit it to the\ncode, to the kids, report that everyone can read it. Teachers have the\nincentive to break own students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:04\nYeah, correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 54:07\nNecessary. I would say they could also grade other students worse than\nnecessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:22\nNow could they share the questions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 54:25\nThe answers? They have the questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:27\nThey could also sell yeah, sell the answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 54:30\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 54:31\nOr not even sell them but in the same way to prepare the students. Sell\nmisuse the questions to prepare students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 54:43\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 54:52\nWhat else could the teacher do? Create their own students better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:59\nWell are they monitoring the exam? They could facilitate some of the\nactions of the students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 55:12\nYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 55:16\nCan you take it to the next level and spoof a teacher?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 55:20\nYeah, of course. Right. They could facilitate a cheating of course in a\nsecond to put that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 55:27\nOn the right hand side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 55:31\nThey could facilitate cheating during what is called proctoring. It\nproctoring the word for this kind of exam? During the exam, right, during\nthe exam. Specific cheating during the exam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 55:48\nSpoofing get teacher access to the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 56:00\nCan you spoof a teacher? The student pretends to be a teacher and then\ndo that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 56:07\nI will try it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 56:08\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 56:08\nI mean it depends how desperate you are. I think this is a matter of\ncreativity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 56:15\nYeah, it depends on the threat agent, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 56:18\nYeah. Here the teacher could be losing or having his password on a post it\nin the class exit or the student guesses the teacher\u0026rsquo;s password based on the\ncar model or the reset question or whatever not students are very creative.\nSince this is at the school network, students could prepare the school\nnetwork to floss the network. We could even have here does the network\nlevel at school, of course, center B, which is not a school. We have the\nother variant, which is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 57:07\nWould you put that as a separate dos? Because you\u0026rsquo;re kind of following\nthe stride here, right? So that could be of dos, right. Is on section, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 57:17\nSure. Oh yeah, you\u0026rsquo;re right. This is here I would say network level at\nschool. Of course you could also have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 57:33\nApp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 57:34\nLevel for the grading system. They could actually try to plot the grading\nsystem, not just the network here, but overflow these ones. One is\nattacking the physical link, the other one is attacking the end of the\nsystem. Teachers, grade students, other students. Some issues facilitate\ncheating during the exam. We of course have the Admin. Within the\ngrading system we have an Admin. And here I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 58:15\nAdmin it\u0026rsquo;s admin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 58:46\nNow the question here is this Admin? The admin, right? We have\ninformation regarding the admin, almost nothing. We know there are 50\nadministrators, which I think it\u0026rsquo;s too many for a system. I have no idea,\nthey\u0026rsquo;re nowhere in the description. We can only guess what that means.\nWhich is for me, basically admin the grading system, which for me would\nbe maybe not a grading system Admin, but this could be the school\ndirector or head teacher of the school. School director. This is the person\nwith Admin capability for the grading system, for their school. And this\nperson let me zoom in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:00:04\nBecause it\u0026rsquo;s not visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:00:08\nThis is the person with Admin access to the school. So this person can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:00:24\nTeachers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:00:38\nReports yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:00:39\nManage the grades per class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:00:45\nCool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:00:48\nManages the grades. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, but yes, sure, that would be getting the\nreports. Right. So the system is going to well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:00:54\nAlso editing the reports. Editing the data, right. Can the admin edit the\ndata?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:01:02\nI think that is a different kind of admin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:01:05\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:01:05\nThis is the tenant admin, if you want. You have the real admin of the\nsystem, the one that sets up the system and keeps it alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:01:14\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:01:14\nSo this is the tenant admin. You could think of it like as a SaaS solution.\nEvery school that is on board is a tenant, should be kept separate. You\nhave Admin, let\u0026rsquo;s call it SRE, people managing it with access to the real\ndata.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:01:36\nCompromise. They could change the grades, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:01:39\nYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:01:39\nThose are the ones that can change the grades, the teachers. We have the\nincentives for the directoradmin. Here the incentive would be to get better\ngrades. Could they have access to the answers? I don\u0026rsquo;t know, but I mean,\nthey could probably try to. That leads to a very interesting question.\nEveryone is talking about the grades, right? Everyone has to do with\nquestions. Who\u0026rsquo;s putting the questions in, who\u0026rsquo;s creating the question?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:02:24\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:02:25\nThat question is not answered at all. Sometimes it takes me a lot longer to\ndo the non technical diagram than to do the technical diagram, because\nthere are so many unanswered questions that immediately show you\nabuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:02:41\nWell, and it goes back to the idea that sometimes when we do these things,\nthe hard part is creating architectural diagrams, right. Getting designs of\nactually how things actually work. Once you have that, it\u0026rsquo;s easier to find\nthe vulnerabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:02:53\nYes, exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:02:56\nWe\u0026rsquo;re already ten minutes. About time. I think we might have to close it\nand then we can decide whether in the next month yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s do another\none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:03:05\nThis is really cool, man. I think this is a great way, too. If you share the\nlinks, then especially with the recording, because the thing sometimes we\ndon\u0026rsquo;t do is let\u0026rsquo;s add more data to the session itself, because once we share\nthe video, the summit session, it\u0026rsquo;s quite a nice one, because the video I\nneed, Adam, is actually here. He adds to it, but, for example, adding the\nlinks, adding some more examples. So, yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s do that. And let\u0026rsquo;s do\nanother session in Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:03:28\nThat\u0026rsquo;s cool. Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:03:30\nSo, without further ado, we come to an abrupt end, but to extend it too\nmuch, maybe next time we can book an hour and a half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:03:41\nYeah, absolutely. Brilliant, man. Good stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:03:44\nLimit anyone in the room that wants to comment or add a question to\nwhat has been said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:03:52\nSure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:03:52\nI think Michael had to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael - 01:03:54\nJust a question. Do we get a copy of the.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:04:00\nMaterial that was presented in GitHub? I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet pushed, because I\u0026rsquo;m\ncreating it live, but everything here, the code you see on the left side, the\nimage and the findings will be on GitHub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:04:14\nYeah. On that link you shared. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:04:18\nThis one here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:04:18\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:04:19\nI just put it again. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:04:45\nOSS threat modeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:04:47\nYeah. I just put the link on the chat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:04:50\nI have to commit, so don\u0026rsquo;t be amazed if it\u0026rsquo;s not yet there. Sorry for that,\nbut I still have to push. In the end it will be here, I promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:05:01\nYeah, cool. Great price to collaborate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:05:03\nThanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:05:05\nSo, yeah, feel free to comment. Feel free to send me. We can link on\nLinkedIn or on Twitter or master them if you\u0026rsquo;re in.

He explains\nthe four-step model for threat modeling and suggests using a structured approach from\nsystem architecture instead of relying on threat modeling tools. Louis then discusses a\nSaaS solution that supports grading systems in one state of the United States as their\ntarget for evaluation and identifies potential threats from students and teachers.\nThe transcript discusses the potential risks of cheating in an exam system and suggests\nways to prevent it. They discuss adding an admin to connect with the grading system and\ncreating architecture diagrams to understand where vulnerabilities may lie. The group also\ntalks about different components involved in the testing process, such as a Node JS API for\ndisplaying questions and a teacher UI for submitting them. They mention that short answer\nand essay questions will be manually graded by teachers before being added to the\nsystem\u0026rsquo;s reporting feature.\nThe speaker discusses creating documentation with dev teams and the value it adds to\nsecurity teams. They also discuss the Python Fast API, node JS UI, and student\nauthentication for a test-taking system. They emphasize the importance of not giving\nadmin rights to everything and improving readability in code by aligning arrows and\ngrouping related items together. The diagram serves as a basis for threat modeling.\nTwo individuals discuss the potential of creating graphs programmatically to scale their\nwork. They prefer the simplicity of graphics and want to create relationships between text\nand code bases that are created programmatically. The need for change is acknowledged,\nbut people often resist it due to time constraints. The speakers plan to make connections\nbetween UI and API less wide while acknowledging between UI and API less wide while acknowledging there is room for innovation in this area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"outline\"\u003eOutline:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m sorry, but based on the transcript provided, I cannot create an outline with chapters and\ntimestamps.

And Luis will walk us through a\nmore in-depth analysis of this great technique and this great practice,\nwhich more in-depth analysis of this great technique and this great practice,\nwhich actually brings a lot of science to this process. So, Louis, over to\nyou.\n00:30\nThank you very much. So.\n00:34\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to continue the threat modeling Kata we did last time. So me,\nI am a security architect, and platform security lead in my current role. I have\nbeen doing threat modeling of many different things since the early 2010s.\nAirplane systems, It systems, OT systems, automotive systems, and some IoT\ngot in the way.\n00:57\nThese are my social media.\n01:01\nAnd let\u0026rsquo;s get started. So I know there are plenty of definitions of threat\nmodeling. My favorite one is the one from Brooke Schunfield. Threat\nmodeling is a technique to identify the attacks the system must resist and\nthe defenses that will bring the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e01:16\nTo a desired defensive state, which informs.\n01:21\nUs why we\u0026rsquo;re doing threat modeling.\n01:22\nRight.\n01:23\nWe want our system to resist the level of attack for which we design it, and\nthat is based on the criticality of the system and the value.\n01:32\nOf the data that we\u0026rsquo;re processing.\n01:35\nNow threat modeling. Regardless of which methodology you take, I think\nthe whole world has settled down into one, into this four step model,\nwhich is understand the system model it.\n01:46\nAnalyze what could go wrong, identify and.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e01:50\nDocument vulnerabilities and threat scenarios, do mitigation analysis or\nrisk treatment, if you prefer to call it that way, and then validate the\noutcome. Make sure that you analyze the right resources and didn\u0026rsquo;t start\ntoo late or didn\u0026rsquo;t do too much or too little. Kata is a word that comes from\nthe Japanese. There are two different kanji symbols for that. I don\u0026rsquo;t really\nknow enough to tell the difference between either, but I chose this one,\nand it means form.\n02:27\nSo if you know the word kata.\n02:30\nFrom martial arts, it means basically choreographing your movements to\nmake them be fluid and make them flow on unitan. And it is practiced to\nmemorize or to create muscle memory.\n02:47\nIn that sense.\n02:48\nMany years ago, Dave Thomas was visiting his son during karate practice,\nsaw what a CATA was, and he said, hey, we know we should be doing this\nfor coding. Dev NEWART took it further and said, okay, let\u0026rsquo;s do software,\narchitectural catas, and there\u0026rsquo;s a repository with catas in GitHub, and\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a website where you can look at them.\n03:16\nAnd basically I\u0026rsquo;m extending that idea, taking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e03:19\nIt further and saying, okay, let\u0026rsquo;s take one of these architectural catas, let\u0026rsquo;s\nfigure out what could go wrong, and then.\n03:27\nGet started with it.\n03:30\nSo to set up your environment.\n03:35\nGive.\n03:35\nMe just a second to make my screen a little bit smaller so that I can see\nyou in the center. So to set up your environment. I am working with Vs\ncode. I am working with a graphics plugin. And in this repository,\nGitHub.com lfservingosthreadmodeling, you will find a file that you can\nimport directly into your Vs code. So if you open Vs code and.\n04:12\nYou open the OSS threat modeling repository.\n04:18\nDirectory, you will see a JSON file. This JSON file, you need to put it in\npreferences, user snippets, choose dot and you should paste it in here. So\nreplace the existing file and paste yours. That will be all you need to be\nable to follow this example as it is. So give me a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e04:46\nAll right, so that\u0026rsquo;s basically all you have to do. And the plugin I am using is\nthat one here.\n05:11\nI have two plugins installed. You can choose to install them both as well\nfrom fans and from your AlPinto.\n05:19\nThese are good places to start so.\n05:20\nThat you can follow along. Now, as to the threat modeling part, so the\nfirst step is modeling. Perhaps you have seen threat modeling diagrams\ndone with a threat modeling tool. So data flow diagrams created with a\nthreat modeling tool from Microsoft.\n05:45\nI don\u0026rsquo;t love creating my threat models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e05:48\nWith a threat modeling tool because sometimes the level of detail is not\nclear, sometimes there\u0026rsquo;s too much detail, sometimes there\u0026rsquo;s too little\ndetail. And the tool is incredibly verbose. So you can have hundreds of\npotential findings that you need to validate. And it\u0026rsquo;s incredibly noisy. So I\nwould suggest not to get too deep into that, I rather use a more structured\napproach from system architecture. I like the model, the diagramming\nmodel from Simon Brown. It\u0026rsquo;s called C four model because every layer\nstarts with a C context the system and its users and third party systems,\ncontainer components and code containers are deployable units, not\ndocker containers. And the most important thing, and this is where the\nthreat modeling tool fails horribly, is that everything has to be labeled. You\nlabeled your data flows, you labeled your elements. And you are consistent\nin the usage of colors.\n06:52\nFor example, blue for in scope, gray for out of scope. And you tell what\nevery element is there for both the nodes and the edges. So meaning the\nlines connecting the notes. Once that is done, basically you can imagine it\nas being some sort of Google Maps where you can zoom in. So you have\nyour system, your target of evaluation in context of its users. You zoom in,\nsee the deployable units that make up the system, you zoom in to one of\nthem, you see the code libraries or whatever you have. And then you can\nzoom into one and you can see individual functions. I hardly ever have\ncome so far down except when I ask for a demonstration of a particular\nway of an implementation of, for example, authentication authorization.\nSo there\u0026rsquo;s a.\n07:53\nThis is the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e07:54\nWe\u0026rsquo;Re gonna do the analysis. Someone rang the door. I need to open the\ndoor for a second. I\u0026rsquo;m extremely sorry. I\u0026rsquo;ll be back in 30 seconds, but in\nthe meantime, you can look at the system requirements.\n08:08\nYes, no worries.\n08:09\nI\u0026rsquo;ll pause the recording meanwhile.\n08:11\nYes, thank you. Sorry. All right, so back from a very short break. So again,\nthis will be in the show notes and in the slides. This is the repo where you\ncan find the exercise and the diagrams.\n08:30\nAnd this is our target of analysis.\n08:33\nSo our target of analysis is a SaaS solution that supports grading systems.\nSo statewide grading systems in one of the states of the United States, but\nthere\u0026rsquo;s nothing saying we couldn\u0026rsquo;t do this in other states or in other\ncountries. I know Germany has the same kind of because I live in\nGermany, I know it has the same kind of nationwide tests that every\nstudent has to go through when they want to graduate from high school.\nSo that could be a system that we could sell overseas.\n09:09\nSo if we\u0026rsquo;re flexible towards the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e09:13\nWe could add these requirements.\n09:15\nAnd the idea is that students will.\n09:19\nOnly be used the application in testing centers, and most of these will be\nschools. But not all students are able to take the test. And the results are\nconsolidated into a single location representing all of the test scores\nacross the state, by school, by teacher, by student. Tests will be multiple\nchoice, short answer, and essay. So we have three types of.\n09:47\nAnswers or test.\n09:49\nWell, test will have different types of questions, and the questions will be\neither multiple choice, short answer, and essay. So I suppose for math you\nmight have multiple choice, whereas for literature or language of choice,\nit will be an essay or a short answer. There would be some reporting to\nknow which students took the tests and the scores they received. So I\nsuppose that is especially useful for the directors of every school or the\nteachers. Short answers and essay questions will be graded by teachers\nand they will add the estate grades to the system.\n10:33\nAnd last but not least, any changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10:37\nInvolves three governmental agencies to make sure that the data is secure.\nThe state does not own the hosting center, everything is outsourced. And\nevery project, the project must fight for its budget every year. So without\nfurther ado, we can start. Any questions as to the use case?\n10:57\nNo. Cool.\n10:58\nNice to meet you.\n10:59\nOn.\n11:00\nAll right, so we started doing this last session and this is what we had. So\nour target of evaluation is a software as a service solution. And of course,\nthese are all the.\n11:27\nDetails that we decided and we came.\n11:30\nOut with this diagram. So let me show the diagram again.\n11:33\nAnd then we can start working on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:35\nThe next version of the diagram.\n11:39\nSo I create the diagram, make it small. Now, there it is.\n11:48\nDo you need to do something to open it in graph vis or should you open\ndirectly.\n11:56\nYou might need to have graphics installed. So I\u0026rsquo;m working on.\n12:04\nIf you go.\n12:04\nTo your terminal, if you run dot.\n12:08\nIt gives me answer.\n12:10\nYes.\n12:10\nIf I go to the terminal and.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12:11\nI write dot, it minus H, it tells me something. Got it?\n12:18\nYeah, I think I need that.\n12:19\nSo you have to have that installed. That\u0026rsquo;s the last requirement.\n12:24\nOf course. Sorry for that. So, .\n12:32\nBased on what we just read so we have testing centers which could be\nschools. We have testing centers which are not schools. So different\nnetwork zones, different scenarios, different threat actors.\n12:45\nWe have students in both, we have teachers, we have a grading system.\n12:54\nAnd this is our target of evaluation.\n12:56\nThe grading system, find IDs to these things. So, for example, a lot of stuff\nin my world we end up in jira, but it could be something else. But I think\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a need to connect this to other systems, right, to wider things. If\nyou have an ID, you would put it here, correct?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e13:19\nOf course.\n13:20\nNow the question is, do you have an ID for the environment it should be\nrunning or for the user?\n13:26\nRight.\n13:26\nBecause in this case, it could be both the same user. But one year the same\nuser does it in his high school and the other year the high school is not\nlending the lab and they have to go to a testing center.\n13:39\nNo, I meant almost the ID for the node. See what you have here. When I\nlook at it, these are nodes.\n13:44\nRight.\n13:45\nYou got a node represents the student, the PC in a computer, PC and\nprotector, and then the teacher and even the grading system. All of those\nare, if you think about nodes, of actually a wider graph. And then part of\nmy thinking here is eventually to start to create this programmatically\nusing a graph database. Because at the moment, the data for this is in the\ndiagram, correct?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14:13\nYes.\n14:14\nI think in a medium term, we almost want this diagram to be created\nalmost from a graph. Do you know what I mean?\n14:24\nExactly.\n14:25\nSo, yes, you could add that. I\u0026rsquo;m not exactly sure where to put it. So it\ncould be some metadata for the node.\n14:34\nYeah, you will be metadata. You will be one of those.\n14:40\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure how much metadata is supported in the graphics format. To\nbe honest. I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried that. So that\u0026rsquo;s something we definitely could try.\n14:47\nCool.\n14:48\nSo basically what I\u0026rsquo;m doing when I create a node, I\u0026rsquo;ll make the diagram a\nbit smaller is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14:57\nMake it a.\n14:58\nBit prettier than it usually is by default. So I create a node that has no\nshape, so all the shapes are plain text, so that I can do some HTML inside.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m basically creating a table, an HTML table that has images. And if I\nturn the table on.\n15:22\nThe cell borders to one, so you could see here how the table looks like.\nCool.\n15:32\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s pretty much easy to read, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\n15:36\nAnd the advantage this has to draw I O and other formats is you\u0026rsquo;re\nactually able to see the commit message or in the diff kit div what changed\nin the diagram?\n15:49\nYeah.\n15:51\nDraw.\n15:51\nI o.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e15:52\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fantastic. You can also have the plugin here. Now the problem is all\nvisual and it\u0026rsquo;s all a bunch of XML in the background. And it\u0026rsquo;s so huge,\nthere\u0026rsquo;s no way to know what change.\n16:02\nExactly.\n16:03\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why we almost want another level of abstraction, isn\u0026rsquo;t it, where you\ncould start almost as diff the behavior right, almost the content, and then\nhave a way to create some of these. So even that table is powerful, but I\nwouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to see the diff. I guess you\u0026rsquo;re saying that if you\u0026rsquo;re only\nmaking a couple of changes on the content, that\u0026rsquo;s what you see on the diff\nin GitHub.\n16:30\nYes, exactly.\n16:31\nSo if I change the description, if I change a connection between nodes.\n16:40\nCorrect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e16:41\nThat\u0026rsquo;s incredibly powerful. And I can just replicate this to do the\ncomponent diagram. Right. So we have the context diagram. Based on the\ncontext diagram, we created a list of findings last time when were\ndiscussing this. So we have Spoofing take an examiner on behalf of\nsomeone else selling the questions. So we had taking pictures of the\nquestions for selling, for cheating, for memorizing the questions, attending\ndifferent locations for the exam repudiation. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t there. Tell me that I\nwas. Those are not my answers. So how do you make sure that there\u0026rsquo;s no\nrepudiation on the answers, on the content? Spoofing get the teacher\naccess to the system and grade myself. So if teachers are grading answers,\nthere are competing interests here to get access to the system. So these\nare all things that students could be trying out.\n17:49\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t it amazing how fast things have moved that now we should add one\nwhich is GPT take the exam on.\n17:54\nBehalf of the student, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Of course.\n17:56\nI mean, we could add that one here and basically is well, not selling the\nquestions, but basically cheating. Right. So cheating couldn\u0026rsquo;t be classical.\n18:12\nAnd you could even add an interesting thread, which is how to do that\nwithout being detected. Do you mean? And that\u0026rsquo;s going to be an\ninteresting thing. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit like if you are a student that has 56% out of\n100, if you then get an exam submitted, that or you get 99 or 98, you\nalmost need now a cheat that actually almost gives your score.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18:39\nExactly.\n18:40\nI just added that one. So what did I do wrong? Cheating.\n18:49\nWhy is it not taking?\n18:57\nYou might need an enter about okay, one more level. I know something\nhappened there with the levels. Oh, it\u0026rsquo;s the space.\n19:05\nIt will have a space too many. No, it\u0026rsquo;s not.\n19:09\nIt might have a tab actually.\n19:13\nThat\u0026rsquo;s okay, now it\u0026rsquo;s working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19:16\nSo use chat TPT to answer the question. So these are all threats that we\nhave identified from the student side. This is just a recap from last month,\nright? And the teachers, were saying, okay, grade your own. There\u0026rsquo;s an\nincentive. Teachers are graded with the students, right? So if my students\ndo better than average, I get a better grade, thus opening positions for\nsalary increases or something else. So if I know whose answer I\u0026rsquo;m\ngrading, I might be more lenient than if I don\u0026rsquo;t know who am I grading?\nGrading other students worse than necessary. I could also be making\nmoney on the site by selling the questions. I could facilitate cheating, so\nattending several locations or allowing someone to take the exam on\nbehalf of someone else. And of course, directors also want to have better\ngrades by taking the answer. So we need to figure out how we\u0026rsquo;re going to\nkeep the findings safe from everyone.\n20:31\nSo this is what we came up last session last month. Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to go\nfurther. So we have the admin. We don\u0026rsquo;t yet know how the admin is\ngetting in, but we know that the admin well, the school director, right? So\nwe have a school director that adds teachers at students get three ports\nper class, per school. So someone has to manage who will have to take the\nexam, right? So we said that was the school director or someone on the\ndirection side of the school.\n21:05\nBy the way, just for reference, to get this UI that we\u0026rsquo;re seeing here with\nLewis, I had to go to the command palette and open the graphics open\npreview and then that\u0026rsquo;s the one that will then preview the what\u0026rsquo;s it called?\n21:26\nDid you every time I have a.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21:29\nGraphics diagram, I have this Open preview.\n21:32\nTo the side activated.\n21:34\nThere you go. That works, too.\n21:36\nPerfect. Yeah.\n21:37\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s a bit easier for wildly maps, they don\u0026rsquo;t have it. So I do have to go\nand click on Open View, but for dot I usually just yeah, that works too.\n21:46\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t used that. Cool.\n21:49\nBrilliant.\n21:49\nYeah, I got it. And we do so which one are you looking at the moment? Are\nyou looking at the great context on the root?\n21:56\nYeah, I think we didn\u0026rsquo;t add the admin, so basically we could add the admin\nnow and say, okay, the admin connects to the grading system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e22:11\nVery cool.\n22:12\nBy the way, this is crazy reference. When you do this with an audience, for\nexample, threat modeling session on site or remote, it\u0026rsquo;s super powerful to\nhave it on screen and then literally be changing the code and seeing the\ndiagram for everybody.\n22:30\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very powerful, to be honest, even if presential, I don\u0026rsquo;t use the\nwhiteboard that much anymore because I have to pass it in clean\nafterwards. So it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of work to.\n22:40\nDo it you might as well be creating the diagram in the session, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\n22:47\nI do. So basically I share the right hand side to more or less show you how\nI do it.\n22:56\nI basically make it big and now.\n23:01\nMove it to the side. So basically I show that side when I\u0026rsquo;m sharing the\nscreen with someone and.\n23:05\nWork on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e23:06\nOf course, now I\u0026rsquo;m not doing it in that exact way because I want you to\nsee how I change the code. But basically here we say, okay, logs.\n23:17\nIn, does administrative functions and that means.\n23:27\nWe now have to open up the system and start looking at the system.\n23:31\nRight.\n23:31\nSo we already identified problems at this very high level. These are usually\nunhappy path scenarios that are not considered in the usual requirements.\nAnd this is the first place where you can start looking. So you don\u0026rsquo;t even\nhave to start doing strides at this layer. At this layer it\u0026rsquo;s just abuse cases.\nSo what could go wrong? How can I use the functionality against the\nsystem now? Frank Adam, do you see any other things on how you could\nabuse?\n24:06\nSo do you think it\u0026rsquo;s different a.\n24:09\nStudent taking the assessment in the testing center, which is not a school\nrather than the school? Are there any difference we should consider? Raise\nyour hands if you think of anything that we should consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e24:30\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t seem so okay. So I mean, it depends a lot.\n24:37\nOn who is proctoring the exam.\n24:39\nRight?\n24:40\nAre the teachers who know the students proctoring the exam for their own\nstudents so they know and they can pass list? Or do we have people who\ndon\u0026rsquo;t know the students and students at a young age don\u0026rsquo;t have IDs. So\nhow do you make sure that whoever is taking the exam is actually who\nthis person should be?\n24:57\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know. Right.\n24:58\nSo if we\u0026rsquo;re taking the test in not a school and the teacher is not\nproctoring, I have no idea how they are identifying the students. So this is\na lot more risky. So we could add here a threat actor. So we could add\nhere a fake student.\n25:18\nLet me see if I yeah, because.\n25:20\nThe student could even somebody could be there doing it for them, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e25:24\nYeah.\n25:24\nSo here we could add a fake student. The short form I use is HTML and I\nwill call it Bad student.\n25:46\nBad Student.\n25:48\nSo if you tap through the snippet that is created, you will jump\nimmediately to the corresponding spaces. So I jumped from the name of\nthe note to the label of the note student.\n26:06\nThat\u0026rsquo;s interesting. What creates that?\n26:10\nThe Snippet that I put the shirt remember JSON, the one you copy paste?\nIf you type HTML and you tap through the fields, it helps you jump from\none to the other. Cool. So I jump to the file path. I have one in images.\n26:31\nHacker transparent.\n26:37\nPNG. No, I didn\u0026rsquo;t name it that way. Give me a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e26:46\nTerminal. No, not the hackathon. Sorry.\n27:00\nHacker minus transparent. Okay, sorry. For that. My mistake.\n27:06\nHacker.\n27:09\nMinus transparent.\n27:10\nSo here you can see I just.\n27:13\nAdded within the picture without a lot of trouble, a nice looking hacker.\n27:19\nSo the bad student.\n27:32\nSo this is someone pretending to be a student. And the purpose is.\n27:40\nCheater pay for the student to pass the exam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e27:52\nSo that the only thing with it being HTML is that you cannot really add\nbreak lines. So I had to ask the break line, like in HTML to pass exam on\ntheir behalf.\n28:07\nAnd this is fundamentally planned. UML, right. So basically, behind the\nhood, if I\u0026rsquo;m not wrong, all graphics or graphics uses this to render it. So\ngraphics has some support for HTML.\n28:19\nYes, this is native graphics. So this is just the reason this works is because\nthe node type is plain text and it just fills in within everything. So I control\nevery aspect of these nodes. So this is also part of the Snippets I created\nand I shared it\u0026rsquo;s. Just start typing, I think, diagram or degraph, and it just\nfills it out for you.\n28:48\nYeah, very cool.\n28:52\nBut student cheater paid for the student to pass the exam on their behalf.\nAnd the nice thing about this is that I can do the student out.\n29:02\nIn a group.\n29:03\nSo student out and bad student. So that easy it is to create new lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e29:11\nRight.\n29:11\nSo bad student and the student try to do this, pass the thing on the exam.\nSo now we know who is doing.\n29:22\nThat\u0026rsquo;S. The interesting one, because you put the brackets in there. Is that\nwhy you create that box around it?\n29:27\nYes.\n29:28\nNo, the box around them is because they\u0026rsquo;re a cluster.\n29:32\nOh, because I got it. Because you got the cluster.\n29:35\nNo, the box around them right now.\n29:37\nIs can I make it bigger?\n29:40\nNo, the box around the curly brackets here is to make sure that they both\nhave the same line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e29:47\nYeah.\n29:48\nSo now in this sense, I\u0026rsquo;m answer label.\n29:54\nFirst of all, label and then answer exam.\n30:01\nSo here we have the bad student answering the exam and here we could\nhave the student cheating and doing all the things. But I mean, in both\ncases it is different, right? So here we have someone pretending to be\nsomeone else. So here we have the nice student and here we have the path\nstudent paid for or whoever is the twin brother or the older brother or\nwhoever.\n30:29\nRight.\n30:32\nSo we have the teacher and now we could start looking at the\narchitecture, right?\n30:36\nSo we could say, okay.\n30:39\nIf we.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e30:40\nOpen the grading system, what could we expect to find? Right?\n30:47\nAnd this is the point where we have to work with an architecture. So since\nthis is an architectural CATA.\n30:53\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t have a given architecture, so.\n30:56\nWe would have to create architecture. So this works great with developers\nor with system architects because they could help you create this. And you\ncan do threat modeling on the fly as they start creating the system. So\nbasically we could copy so let.\n31:16\nMe save this file. Okay, it\u0026rsquo;s saved. Now I\u0026rsquo;ll just replicate the file, copy\npaste, and I will rename it to container. Come on.\n31:43\nWhy is it not working?\n31:44\nCome on, come on. I have no idea why I kind of changed the.\n31:56\nOh, I pasted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e31:57\nIn the wrong place.\n31:58\nOkay, I need to open the terminal.\n31:59\nPardon? Great context. So move great context to create kata.\n32:16\nContainer graphics. So now here what I can do is.\n32:27\nClose this thing.\n32:29\nI close this thing, I close this one. Now, of course, this is still the.\n32:36\nSame one.\n32:39\nBut now I could start adding.\n32:44\nImages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e32:45\nI could start adding AWS architectural elements, right?\n32:50\nSo one thing I could expect to.\n32:53\nSee here is some sort of WAF. Well, first of all, a network, right?\n33:00\nSo.\n33:03\nI will start carving out here the network, and I will start pruning the\nnumber of students, right? Because we don\u0026rsquo;t care too much about the\nstudents, we care about the connections and where they are connecting to.\n33:21\nSo in terms of groupings a bit together, would it be good to, for example,\nstart creating folders for these scenarios? And then inside those folders\nyou can almost have a markdown that explains what it is. And then all the\ndiagrams that you create based on that particular scenario.\n33:39\nWhat I usually do, to be honest, is give me a second, I have the report\nhere.\n33:46\nSo I have the report, I start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e33:50\nAdding the diagrams and how I look at things. So this is the diagram I\nrepresent whatever I start finding here. And then I start adding here the\nvulnerability, the attack scenario and the outcome. So I have one\ndocument that encompasses this. And then I add this document with a\ncontext diagram, the container diagram. So the detailed technical view of\nthe cloud system in this case. So basically, I could add here. So here, of\ncourse, we don\u0026rsquo;t yet.\n34:44\nHave the trading system container diagram images. Well, it couldn\u0026rsquo;t be\ngreat context, but rather grave container.\n35:02\nAnd I will just print out the grave context again, give me 1 second because\nwe made some changes.\n35:08\nSo.\n35:12\nContext. So pardon me just for 1 second while I print the great context\nwith the changes. Thread modeling images create context. Yes, override.\nAnd that basically overrides. It in my diagram so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to suffer too\nmuch. And then I can start with the container diagram. And here I could\nstart by deleting this grading system, because now we\u0026rsquo;re going to go into\nthe details of the grading system. So here we could say, okay, I have a\ncluster, and here we have.\n35:55\nAn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e36:01\nExternal zone cluster, external. Here we have the.\n36:07\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know.\n36:08\nLet\u0026rsquo;S call it DM set. This is the exposed. This is to the Internet. So we can\nsee that has changed a bit. Actually, it\u0026rsquo;s not yet there because we removed\nit. So it\u0026rsquo;s an empty cluster right now. And here we could have different\nnodes. So I will not put images right now. I\u0026rsquo;ll add the images later. So here\nwe could have the test API.\n36:53\nTest API.\n37:02\nThis is a I don\u0026rsquo;t know, let\u0026rsquo;s say Python. Which framework do we like in\nPython for making APIs?\n37:13\nIt\u0026rsquo;s called fast API.\n37:15\nFast API. Lovely.\n37:17\nPretty awesome API, because it also gives you the Swagger file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e37:21\nI know, I know, they\u0026rsquo;re like different flavors, right? But then you can say\nthat. And then this one is receives answers from authenticated users. Okay,\nlet\u0026rsquo;s see where we have it. So we can see that it\u0026rsquo;s growing here,\ndisconnected from everything. But we can start seeing that.\n37:50\nHere we have the test API.\n37:54\nNow we have the test UI, which is hosted in a react or whatever. So let\u0026rsquo;s\nsay this is the test UI.\n38:09\nNo HTML?\n38:12\nNo test UI.\n38:19\nTest UI.\n38:22\nBy the way, what\u0026rsquo;s cool about this is that what we\u0026rsquo;re really doing is also\ndefining those what\u0026rsquo;s it called, pressed boundaries, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Where we start\nto understand exactly what\u0026rsquo;s running where, and that will make a massive\ndifference in our threads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e38:41\nExactly, that\u0026rsquo;s the idea. So the idea here is that we have Node JS that we\nunderstand. And that\u0026rsquo;s why I like the C Four modeling convention, because\nyou really understand.\n38:52\nIn a very structured way who interacts.\n38:56\nWith your system, how your system is distributed, technology choices. And\nthen you can add on that whatever else you need to add on that. If we\nneed to understand how the test API is built, the individual components.\n39:10\nThat make up the test API, we.\n39:13\nCan go so far. But we don\u0026rsquo;t need to go so far to see what could go wrong\nin general. So here we have the Node JS interface. Let me make this word\nwrap.\n39:28\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a bit easier to work with word wrap. I lost myself, sorry. Node JS.\n39:34\nOkay, we have a Node JS API.\n39:37\nAnd this one basically shows the questions to the students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e39:46\nSo now we have we call it TMZ. But I mean, this could all be running\nwithin a Kubernetes cluster. Or this could be running wherever we wanted,\nright? So that\u0026rsquo;s the testing part. Now we need the testing creation part,\nand we need a few more elements, right?\n40:03\nSo we have the teacher UI. Here we have it.\n40:19\nSo here we have another HTML node.\n40:23\nTeacher UI. Teacher UI. And again.\n40:32\nThis is a python.\n40:36\nFast API thingy.\n40:39\nAnd this.\n40:42\nAllows teachers to.\n40:47\nSubmit questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e40:50\nFurther.\n40:56\nIt allows teachers to we could save ourselves some trouble. Allows\nteachers to break here.\n41:09\nAnd then submit questions. Great.\n41:26\nAnswers. What else could the teacher do?\n41:32\nOr you could also have a malicious teacher, right?\n41:35\nNo, well, I mean, the normal right.\n41:37\nNow, like the normal requirements right now.\n41:40\nWe\u0026rsquo;Re just painting the happy picture. And then we can start doing the\nhacking, the bad stuff.\n41:46\nRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e41:46\nBut first we. Need to understand what we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with. So students test\nwill be multiple choice. The system should have a reporting system to\nknow which students have taken the test and what score they received.\nShort answer and essay questions will be manually graded by teachers,\nwho will then add essay grades to the system. Change approval state does\nnot own project, must defend its budget.\n42:14\nSo, yeah, that seems fair.\n42:17\nAnd also, the other thing that\u0026rsquo;s interesting about up until now is ideally\nthis should be provided by the dev team, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\n42:25\nIdeally this to be honest, I usually create it with the dev team because I\nhave yet to see a dev team that keeps their documents up to them because\nthey have to go to VCO, they have to go to draw IO, they have to leave\ntheir ID.\n42:41\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s why the developers eventually start to love this kind of stuff,\nbecause this allows them to keep maintaining their documentation up to\ndate. And this is a good example where we can add a lot of value to\nsecurity teams because we need this and they also want it too.\n42:57\nYes, exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e42:58\nSo in one of my previous positions, I actually gave like a class on how to\ndo this, and some teams.\n43:07\nActually started doing it, so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t.\n43:11\nEnforce it, but at least it won enough traction that people were willing to.\n43:15\nTry it out, which for me is a win, right?\n43:20\nOh, no, I got it wrong.\n43:21\nSo this is the Python Fast API.\n43:25\nThing, and the UI is node JS.\n43:36\nProcesses input from users from teachers.\n43:48\nNow, we could start looking at this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e43:50\nAnd say, okay, well, actually, not everyone.\n43:53\nWill be talking to the same thing, right? So ideally we could have students\nnot talking to grading, but talking to.\n44:08\nWhat.\n44:08\nDo they call it? And that\u0026rsquo;s the only thing you need to keep in mind always.\n44:12\nLike, how did you call things?\n44:14\nSo we called it teacher API. Teacher UI.\n44:17\nLet\u0026rsquo;s make it all look the same.\n44:20\nSo teacher API with small and API and PS.\n44:23\nTeacher UIP, test UI and test API. Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e44:32\nSo with that naming convention in place, it\u0026rsquo;s easier.\n44:35\nSo the student talks to the test UI to retrieve questions from the student.\n44:51\nTalks to the test API. And this is a crucial thing that is often overseen by\ndevelopers, right? The UI being node JS is loaded into my browser, which\nexecutes in my context. And the API is actually not necessary. It\u0026rsquo;s optional\nat the moment where it runs in my context. I can just decide to use it or\nnot.\n45:31\nBut also you could argue that test UI should not be inside that DMZ.\n45:36\nRight? Well, you\u0026rsquo;re going to serve it.\n45:40\nSo the static file oh, God, I got it.\n45:44\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the static version of the test UI, basically.\n45:47\nWell, rather than retrieve the questions and send responses to disappears\nfrom this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e45:54\nRight?\n45:55\nWell, to be honest, I think there\u0026rsquo;s value in actually putting it on the\nbrowser? Because if you think about it, that\u0026rsquo;s what you have. Then there\nit\u0026rsquo;s almost just static files, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\n46:07\nIt is, but you still have to identify that you have a node JS or not node JS\nNGINX, probably, or CDN or something serving these files.\n46:19\nYeah. But then isn\u0026rsquo;t it better to put the test UI on the browser context?\nBecause he implies that the trust boundary, like you said, we need to go\nhow does he get the data? Because that is just almost a static server of the\nprovide content. Which is important because you might actually have a\nnode back end. Right. You might actually have. Which in this case we\nactually say we don\u0026rsquo;t have, because you actually say you\u0026rsquo;re using Python\nfor it. If I saw this, I was going, why are we using node JS? But if I have a\nPython past API, what is the actual node JS actually doing that an NGINX\ncan do? Because that would increase the attack surface.\n47:17\nYes.\n47:18\nWell, I mean, to get here, you do need some authentication. Right. And this\nis the point where I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to give the so either every student\ncomes to school or to the test day with their password or their Identifier in\nthe hand that they received during class, or there\u0026rsquo;s no way to onboard\nthem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e47:38\nRight.\n47:39\nSo there\u0026rsquo;s here there\u0026rsquo;s a cat in a sack that\u0026rsquo;s not exactly clear how it got\nthere.\n47:45\nYeah.\n47:46\nOr they can be given a UID, some token when it is lost.\n47:50\nYou can give them something, but how do you give it to the student?\n47:53\nI mean, think of eleven year olds.\n47:57\nThey might or might not have a cell phone. They might or might not have\na laptop. So you need to give them a piece of paper that they can take.\n48:05\nTo the exam on that day or.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e48:07\nReceive on that day and use it to type in and identify themselves towards\nthe system. Right. So here at some point retrieve static content from and\nthen we might need to even say, hey, this is the browser running the test\nUI. So now, because this is a computer.\n48:25\nNot a student, the browser is running.\n48:28\nThe test UI, is sending answers to the test API, retrieving the static content\nfrom here. So now we identify the relationships.\n48:35\nYeah, got it. So in your case, the browser is the box above.\n48:40\nYeah, got it.\n48:41\nSo this is the browser running the test UI. And now we need to figure out\nhow does the user authenticate. Right. And that\u0026rsquo;s not something that they\ngave us.\n48:50\nSo we might need to add for.\n48:52\nAuthentication, which is something I usually add after the protocol itself,\nhttps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e49:01\nUID for authentication.\n49:07\nSo this person has a UID and then we could enhance this in the context\ndiagram saying how this person gets.\n49:15\nThe authentication code, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Right.\n49:18\nSo we could add that later and basically the same story happens to the\nteacher. So the teacher does not log into the grading system. The teacher\ntalks to the teacher, UI, logs in.\n49:40\nRetrieves static content, and this.\n49:46\nIs Https, and they do have a.\n49:56\nUser ID, clues, passwords, or some other.\n50:01\nWay to authenticate themselves or their single tenant, let\u0026rsquo;s say.\n50:05\nSingle tenant. Single tenant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e50:07\nSo they need to use the same credentials they use for school. Single\ntenant. Let\u0026rsquo;s make ourselves CC yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s fair enough, right?\n50:14\nWhich actually then when you go into the remote one, that might\nintroduce a curveball because they might not have the.\n50:22\nSame system, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Yeah.\n50:28\nSo give me a second while okay, there it goes. So label, and now the label\nis.\n50:38\nSends grades to questions.\n50:46\nRetrieves at the content. Oh, well, sends and receives.\n50:50\nSo sends grades queries questions from.\n51:04\nSends grades to.\n51:08\nSo basically the API, the teacher use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e51:12\nIt to query questions to and send grades to. And this is just for the long\nform and short form answers. So this is the teacher and we can say here is\ngrading.\n51:28\nGrades, long.\n51:29\nForm answers in the browser. So little by little you can see that the\ndiagram starts to look differently.\n51:40\nAnd we could even say, okay, could.\n51:43\nThey even be in the same segment?\n51:45\nI mean, to be honest, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t.\n51:48\nHave these things in the same segment. I would probably want to isolate\none from the other.\n51:56\nAnd then we could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e51:58\nKeep on doing this exercise. I mean, I\u0026rsquo;m running out of time now, so I\u0026rsquo;m\njust going to wrap it up. Showing like the next logical step would be to\nadd here another cluster.\n52:14\nDatabase.\n52:18\nDB zone, VPC database.\n52:26\nHTML, DB.\n52:35\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s the SQL database from AWS called.\n52:39\nI always refer Aurora. Believe so, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, it seems good enough.\nAurora SQL database. Now we know what we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with.\n52:54\nAnd then who connects to it, right? So on the one here stores, questions.\n53:13\nAnswers, sorry, it\u0026rsquo;s too small.\n53:17\nStores, questions, answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e53:21\nGrades.\n53:32\nWhat else do we have here? Student.\n53:37\nData, maybe? Stats, school districts, schools.\n53:47\nWhat were you mentioning?\n53:48\nStats, statistics and activity data.\n53:53\nDepends. Right.\n53:56\nStatistics.\n54:02\nYeah. And then of course something has to.\n54:07\nConnect to it because else it has no value, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e54:09\nExactly.\n54:10\nThis reminds you of that joke of that teacher that was doing a pen test\ncourse and said, here\u0026rsquo;s a page that has all your scores and you all failed.\nYour job by the end of the semester is to pass. You have to hack into the\nsystem and change your grade.\n54:29\nIf you do, you pass.\n54:31\nSo that was such a cool way to say teach your grade. At the moment,\nyou\u0026rsquo;re all failing.\n54:39\nThat\u0026rsquo;s great. Teacher API. They both.\n54:46\nRead.\n54:47\nNo, they talk to the did I just call it database? I just called it database.\n55:00\nOkay, so that\u0026rsquo;s the only thing when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e55:03\nYou do this, you have to keep.\n55:06\nThe names of the notes in your head database.\n55:09\nAnd here we could add a label in which I mean, this couldn\u0026rsquo;t be all too\nuncommon, in which you say.\n55:18\nRead, write data, two, and they connect.\n55:23\nAs the.\n55:27\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s encrypted communication.\n55:33\nWhatever protocol the database speaks, but admin user. So I have found\nthis so often, and it\u0026rsquo;s always a great discussion why.\n55:45\nIt\u0026rsquo;S a bad idea to need, right? Yeah, because that makes a big difference.\nBecause what\u0026rsquo;s interesting is that you have, for example, these different\nUIs here, and then you can ask the question, why should the test API has\nprivileges to change stuff where you should be in a situation where even if\nthe test API has a vulnerability, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have the privileges to change\nstuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e56:07\nThat\u0026rsquo;s exactly what I end up in my discussions with developers. So I\nusually end up here with developers saying, okay, it\u0026rsquo;s a terrible idea to\nhave admin rights here. Oh, but we do this and we do that.\n56:23\nYes.\n56:23\nBut if by any chance any one single location, you miss something and I\u0026rsquo;m\nable to say, drop tables, you lost the game.\n56:31\nYeah.\n56:33\nAnd sometimes they react to that and.\n56:35\nSay, okay, you\u0026rsquo;re right, it\u0026rsquo;s a good example of saying that makes a\nvulnerability in that test API ten times more toxic than otherwise, because\nthen you almost limit the damage that can be done.\n56:50\nExactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e56:51\nSo give me just 1 second, because right now it makes no difference to have\nthe bad student here, so I\u0026rsquo;m just going to kill them. And we do need the\nadmin, right? So we need the admin to be able to talk to the admin\ninterface. So the teachers are doing some things and the admin is doing\nthe same. So basically we would need to add.\n57:11\nThe same again for admins.\n57:15\nBut we run out of time. So this is an exercise and commit to GitHub. I\nmean, I can commit to GitHub. Well, I will not do live. I\u0026rsquo;ll commit to\nGitHub in a few minutes after the call. And we can wrap this up next\nweek. Well, next Open Security Summit, in which we do compare these\nagainst threat modeling.\n57:40\nTools from Microsoft to see who gets more actionable results. For\nexample.\n57:46\nYeah, I think it\u0026rsquo;d be really cool to see if you can refactor a little bit. For\nexample, that HTML code so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have the complexity and you\nhave a better diff, isn\u0026rsquo;t it, on the actual code. But the super powerful thing\nis at the bottom of that file that you have there, where the relationships\nare now. Easy to read, easy to map, easy to like. If you scroll down on the\nleft. I think the real powerful is this bit here, right? In fact, if you just\nmaximize that\u0026rsquo;s the power, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Just a little thing. What I tend to do\nhere is just move it a bit to the right. Again, I tend to add spaces because I\nthink you can. So I try to align, for example, even the arrows so that you\ncan almost read them, so you can add space C, so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect the\nresult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e58:43\nSo you kind of get them all in one line. So you could see that at the\nmoment you almost want to have all the arrows to the right aligned.\n58:54\nYeah.\n58:55\nBut even on the student, I would also align that with the one below. Do I\nmean no, go up to line 96. On line 96, you know the arrow if you tab it?\nNo, tab to the left. Yeah. Now if you tab it and you align it with the arrow\non line.\n59:17\n98 oh, I see what you\u0026rsquo;re saying.\n59:20\nYeah. See, so by doing that and then it might be that you might sometimes\neven allow I\u0026rsquo;m just kidding.\n59:27\nThis one anyways, remember?\n59:28\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e59:28\nOr maybe if you kill that, then you maybe don\u0026rsquo;t need that. But you see\nwhat I mean? So I try to align it because it\u0026rsquo;s much easier to read, right.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s kind of like you almost go AB and yeah, so I tried to align that in code.\nYou might not need such a big space now that you don\u0026rsquo;t have the one\nbelow, but always add a little bit like that, a couple of extra spaces. And in\nthis case it\u0026rsquo;s cool because graph, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how many spaces you\ngot, it still basically uses the separator. In fact, even you could see even to\nthe right of the arrow, just add a couple of spaces, it becomes already\nmuch more readable.\n01:00:03\nRight.\n01:00:04\nSo even there yeah, just two spaces there, see? Or a tab. See, I mean, like\neven that is already much cool, you know, to read. See what I mean?\n01:00:15\nLike I know what you mean. So here I could basically ask admin.\n01:00:24\nAdmin UI.\n01:00:29\nAdmin.\n01:00:37\nAPI. Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s about the problem is once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e01:01:00\nYou cluster them, you lose a lot of space.\n01:01:04\nRight.\n01:01:04\nSo either you don\u0026rsquo;t cluster or you yeah. Break the line. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if you\ncan break the line, actually.\n01:01:11\nYeah, but see, this is a good example of sometimes I prefer the inefficiency\nof not clustering because it improves readability.\n01:01:21\nYeah. Do.\n01:01:22\nI mean, sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s like you might get a little bit of efficiency, but\nespecially in the code, I always goes, well, it\u0026rsquo;s not because you can\nimprove it or make it smaller that it actually makes you more readable.\nBecause I think the readability is a lot more important than sometimes\nsome of these clusters or some of these code optimizations that you have\nthere.\n01:01:45\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e01:01:47\nBecause even here, what you can do is you can start to group them. Look\nat how nice it is to have all the admins in one place, all the students in one\nplace.\n01:01:56\nYeah, I think it improves readability a lot.\n01:01:58\nAbsolutely. And especially once you start diffing it gets even more relevant.\n01:02:03\nCertainly I\u0026rsquo;m literally sending that screenshot to my team right now.\n01:02:09\nCheck this out. This is threat modeling as code.\n01:02:13\nWell, it\u0026rsquo;s diagramming as code, right? Threat modeling comes afterwards.\nThe problem is this is not even threat modeling, right? This is the basis for\nthreat modeling. And once you have this in place here, then you can start\ndoing threat modeling because it\u0026rsquo;s trivial now you have all the information\nyou want. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to consolidate or correlate diagrams with\ndescriptions and this other thing and this other that. Everything is one\nplace now. It\u0026rsquo;s very easy to focus and just zoom in and you\u0026rsquo;re done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e01:02:46\nYeah, and then there\u0026rsquo;s so much potential here man, this is definitely\nsomething we need to keep experiment on this. And this is also an area\nwhere I feel the new GBT world of code pilot and things like that. I think\nnow again to the point where some of these will be created\nprogrammatically so we can take it to the next level in a much more\nscalable way. But this pattern would always going to be needed. It\u0026rsquo;s just a\nway to scale this to the next level.\n01:03:11\nCertainly.\n01:03:15\nThe problem is I haven\u0026rsquo;t found something that\u0026rsquo;s really a lot better than\nthis. So I know this is a bit clunky and it\u0026rsquo;s not yet perfect, but.\n01:03:24\nThe simplicity of graphics is by far superior to me.\n01:03:30\nEspecially when diffing to draw IO or other things that are more wishy we\nwhat you see is what you get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e01:03:36\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;ve done is in some cases I start to just throw those nodes and edges\nsometimes in jira, sometimes in JSON files and then create the graph like\nthat using plan to ML which basically creates these graph bits, just a wrap\naround graph this and to try to make it easy to understand and to\nvisualize it. And I want to work on a system that were already creating\nthose text programmatically from reality. So imagine a world where you\nanalyze the code base or a repo and those relationships that you have\nthere literally that text is also created programmatically added to a\nversion control. So you still have the same base because it\u0026rsquo;s like you\nmentioned before, draw your visio, it\u0026rsquo;s all nice, but it creates works of art.\nPeople can\u0026rsquo;t maintain it and more we need things that come directly from\nreality.\n01:04:36\nCool. Exactly.\n01:04:38\nThat\u0026rsquo;s usually the problem I face. They\u0026rsquo;ve spent so much time doing one\nthing and then something changes, they don\u0026rsquo;t want to do it again.\n01:04:49\nAbsolutely right. And also the worst part for me is that everybody becomes\nallergic to change because in their heads they\u0026rsquo;re like oh, that\u0026rsquo;s going to\ntake me half an hour to do. So they almost start arguing why not to\nchange versus just saying no, that\u0026rsquo;s reality. That\u0026rsquo;s how he goes, that\u0026rsquo;s how\nhe evolves. And of course you can version control it. There\u0026rsquo;s lots of things\nthat are not.\n01:05:11\nVery good with it, certainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e01:05:13\nSo basically, I have now made the diagram, so, of course it looks a lot\ndifferent. And we could predify this a little bit in which we make invisible\nconnections between the UI and the API so.\n01:05:28\nThat it\u0026rsquo;s less wide.\n01:05:32\nBut usually screens are wider than they\u0026rsquo;re taller, so I\u0026rsquo;d rather have them\ngoing sideways than going is lengthwise.\n01:05:40\nYeah, well, man brilliant.\n01:05:43\nThat\u0026rsquo;s another session. Good materials. And then for anybody watching,\nright. This is real world, right? This is literally how, at the moment, we do\nstuff, and still the state of the art is there\u0026rsquo;s lots of great areas for\ninnovating here. So cool. So, Louis, thanks for doing this session and I see\nyou in the next one.\n01:06:02\nSee you next time.

He explains\nthe four-step model for threat modeling and suggests using a structured approach from\nsystem architecture instead of relying on threat modeling tools. Louis then discusses a\nSaaS solution that supports grading systems in one state of the United States as their\ntarget for evaluation and identifies potential threats from students and teachers.\nThe transcript discusses the potential risks of cheating in an exam system and suggests\nways to prevent it. They discuss adding an admin to connect with the grading system and\ncreating architecture diagrams to understand where vulnerabilities may lie. The group also\ntalks about different components involved in the testing process, such as a Node JS API for\ndisplaying questions and a teacher UI for submitting them. They mention that short answer\nand essay questions will be manually graded by teachers before being added to the\nsystem\u0026rsquo;s reporting feature.\nThe speaker discusses creating documentation with dev teams and the value it adds to\nsecurity teams. They also discuss the Python Fast API, node JS UI, and student\nauthentication for a test-taking system. They emphasize the importance of not giving\nadmin rights to everything and improving readability in code by aligning arrows and\ngrouping related items together. The diagram serves as a basis for threat modeling.\nTwo individuals discuss the potential of creating graphs programmatically to scale their\nwork. They prefer the simplicity of graphics and want to create relationships between text\nand code bases that are created programmatically. The need for change is acknowledged,\nbut people often resist it due to time constraints. The speakers plan to make connections\nbetween UI and API less wide while acknowledging between UI and API less wide while acknowledging there is room for innovation in this area.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Threat Modeling Kata Part 2","topics":null,"track":"Threat Modeling","twitter":null,"type":"working-session","url":"/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/threat-modeling-kata2/","website":null,"weight":0,"when_day":"Mon","when_month":"Jun","when_time":"WS-17-18","when_year":2023,"wordcount":9453,"youtube_link":"https://youtu.be/NG4_UIziVD4","zoom_link":"https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZErdOGtqj8iEtHB21i_tRD1pMsafhX7D_ZT"},{"company":null,"content":"\u003ch2 id=\"transcript\"\u003eTranscript:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 00:00\nYou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 00:02\nHi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 00:03\nWelcome to this open Security Summit in October 2023. And we have\nLewis for the part three or Thread Modeling Qatar, which is a really\namazing concept that a lot of people should be following because it\u0026rsquo;s all\nabout practicing, trying these things and getting a lot of amazing\nmomentum. So, Louis, over to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 00:24\nThank you very much, Denis. So this is Louis Servin. I\u0026rsquo;m an application\nsecurity expert, have been working in this area of knowledge for a long\ntime now, over ten years, 15 years almost. Yeah, probably more 15 than\nten. I have been doing threat models for such a long time. Oh, I should\nchange the title. Sorry for that. I promise not to. Okay, wait, it\u0026rsquo;s just a title\nthat I need to change. So again, I have been in threat modeling since two\nthousand and ten s. I have been threat modeling many different systems as\na consultant, as an in house expert across different fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:12\nI worked for a long time for an automotive company, and I had the\npleasure of being the first person to create a security assessment, a threat\nmodel of factory shop floor look at automotive systems, bridge over\nknowledge for threat modeling from it into the automotive domain. But\nwe\u0026rsquo;re not discussing that. So that\u0026rsquo;s just a bit of background. What we\u0026rsquo;re\ndiscussing is threat modeling. And because the topic of this session or this\nround of the Security Summit was serverless architectures, I decided to,\nhey, let\u0026rsquo;s do a serverless architecture threat model. Why not? And as I was\npreparing this, and I had already chosen the case and I was doing\neverything, I had a very interesting conversation with Dennis yesterday on\na panel were sharing, discussing how to enhance our threat modeling\ncapabilities through something like Chat GPT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 02:14\nSo I took the bait and I decided to try to do some threat modeling on a\nserverless architecture and enhance my superpowers or my abilities. No,\nsuperpowers enhance my ability to become a superpower by using Chat\nGPT. So I hope Chat GPT doesn\u0026rsquo;t make me look like a fool. I did try a very\nsimple rudimentary prompt, but I want to have the real prompt with you.\nBut first of all, let\u0026rsquo;s discuss what we\u0026rsquo;re doing. So feel free to interject with\na comment or something. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to keep them open. Let me see, how can I\nopen the comments? Chat here. So if you have any questions, drop a\nquestion into the chat and I\u0026rsquo;ll make sure to answer as fast as I can. All\nright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 03:15\nSo threat modeling, I like Brooke Schoenfield\u0026rsquo;s definition the most, is a\ntechnique to identify attacks a system must resist and defenses that will\nbring it to a desired defensive state. So no chances. Based on business\nvalue, we defend more, we defend less. And I chose the title of Kata based\non this martial arts practice of performing a set of choreographed\nmovements. If you ever took karate, for example, katas are part of your\nexamination to move from one belt to the other. And the higher up you go\nin the rank, the more complex the movements are. And catas give you a\nway to perfect or construct this so called muscle memory. So I\u0026rsquo;m not\ninventing the term of CATA for doing technical work. Actually there\u0026rsquo;s a lot\nof previous work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 04:17\nI like to take the architectural catas from Neil Ford and I think he took\nthe concept from someone doing development catas as well. So I could say\nat least ten years of catas as a concept for It systems. So I could advise\nyou to look into that if you want to test or flex your engineering muscles.\nWas I showing the right presentation? So kata. Is this symbol from\nJapanese? It could be actually two symbols and it means form. Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s\nmove to the next one threat modeling, just in case no one knows about it\nor someone doesn\u0026rsquo;t know about it, is basically a four step process. The\nfirst one being understanding what we\u0026rsquo;re building, modeling the system,\nthe second analyzing the threats, identifying what could go wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 05:14\nAnd the most important step is actually the third one, which is mitigation\nthe requirements, the things that need to be added on top to solve the\nthreats that we identified or the vulnerabilities and threats. So one\ncommon concept that we see is difficult for many people is to differentiate\nbetween a vulnerability and a threat. And I would like to use the\nopportunity to say a vulnerability is a characteristic of the system. It\u0026rsquo;s\nperhaps a negative characteristic, but it\u0026rsquo;s something that belongs to the\nsystem. And a threat vector, an attack is something that exploits this\nvulnerability for malicious purposes. And cross site scripting is an attack\nvector, not a vulnerability. Just out of principle, it\u0026rsquo;s an attack technique.\nThe vulnerability is taking input from an untrusted source and presenting\nit to the user where it can be interpreted as code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 06:15\nAnd the fourth step, which is validating the outcome, so is the\narchitecture. Is my understanding of the model in step one correct? Are\nthe threats I identified and the vulnerabilities present and reachable? Is\nthe mitigation correct, complete or should I add more or take some? And\nfor this session I took a system from a Tweet. So someone was let me see\nif I can find the Tweet. Give me 1 second to see if I have I had it open. Let\nme see if I have the Tweet here. Yeah, I have it here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 07:01\nCan you just quickly paste that content in the chat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 07:05\nOf course I can. So I will put it in the slides as fantastic. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s there in\nthe chat. Of course. So I took from Raul Hunko this definition of a Qatar.\nSo he\u0026rsquo;s giving a Qatar for development and he\u0026rsquo;s saying OK, I need a\nsystem to manage books. And he goes on to describe it and it looks very\nsimple like that. So basically I took his definition and made a couple of\nslides just to have it more present. So what are we building? What is our\ntarget of analysis? It\u0026rsquo;s a bookshop. The bookshop will have books, we\u0026rsquo;ll\nhave customers, we\u0026rsquo;ll have orders and payments. Not too difficult. Only\nauthenticated users can make orders. A customer can have many orders,\nan order can have many order items. An order has one payment, an order\nitem is one book. Easy peasy, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 08:10\nNow, connection to the database he says use an entity framework or\nHibernate. Let\u0026rsquo;s say we use Java, we use Hibernate to connect to the\ndatabase and map code entities, code classes to tables. So we delegated\nthat and Hibernate will manage the database connections and we will\ncreate some rest endpoints. So we have getbooks to get all books\nPostBooks to add a new book which is only accessible to the admin. Delete\nbooks and a book ID to delete a book by its ID and it\u0026rsquo;s the admin get\norders, get all orders. It\u0026rsquo;s something only the admin can do. Post orders is\ncreate a new order, get orders with an order ID is to retrieve a specific\norder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 09:04\nSo as a customer I can look at my order and see which books were\nincluded in the order and I can post a payment process a payment for an\norder. So that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;ve got. And now we say okay, we have an\nauthentication using JSON web tokens which means there is an identity\nprovider which will allow my customers and my administrators to log in,\nidentify themselves, gain a token to authorize themselves to make calls to\nthe backend system. He says configure serilog. I have no idea what Serilog\nis, but I will say configure log for J in Java for logging and logs need to be\nmanaged by Azure\u0026rsquo;s AWS log management service and there will be unit\ntests to test that the endpoints are working and integration tests and that\u0026rsquo;s\nabout it. I mean, we can look into the database and all that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 10:11\nSo the point here to start is and the first challenge always is where do I\nstart? So do I jump right into the details or do I want to spend some time\nlooking at the database or at the case in order? And do I have all actors\nrepresented in this solution? So what I usually do, let me stop sharing my\nscreen and share my well, I can share it here, so I have to work over there.\nSo let me share my GitHub. If you want to follow along what I will be\ndoing, you can follow on GitHub give me just 1 second to add the link\nhere, let me post it on the chat. So on GitHub LF serving OSS Threat\nModeling just lost the chat window. Where\u0026rsquo;s the chat window? There\u0026rsquo;s the\nchat window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 11:49\nSo if you go to this GitHub you will find so let me put it on the slides to\nmake sure that everyone has it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 12:02\nYeah, we\u0026rsquo;re only seeing your slide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 12:03\nYeah, you\u0026rsquo;re still seeing my slide or not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 12:07\nYeah, we only seen the slide. Let\u0026rsquo;s stop here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 12:10\nAll right, give me a second. I thought you were seeing my so let me add\none slide files. So that\u0026rsquo;s the repository where you can find the exercise\nwe\u0026rsquo;ll be doing so you can clone it. Let me share my screen then. Not just\nthe file. So share the whole screen. Share. Now I will put my Vs codes on\nthe screen. Can you see my Vs codes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 13:03\nYou can?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 13:06\nWas that a yes or a no?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 13:07\nYeah, you can. All right, perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 13:11\nYes. So I started creating a very high level diagram in which we have a\ncustomer, an API, and then let\u0026rsquo;s make the database. So I create there are\ninstructions on the repository to use this JSON file that generates these\nhandy functions I am using. So you can use it. I will create one without\nimages to simplify development. So this is my DB and this is my database.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s RDS postgresQL. And here we store and serve book and customer\ndata. So basically, what I\u0026rsquo;m using is the graph language to create graphs,\ngraphical representations of graphs. These elements you see here are\ncalled like in any graph nodes. And the links between the nodes are called\nedges. So basically what will happen is that I have also HTML.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 14:38\nI could enhance this with the images from AWS, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend\ntime finding out the image. So I\u0026rsquo;ll do them without images. Cognito this is\nmy identity provider and this is let mistake, provides pardon? I couldn\u0026rsquo;t\nhear you. Well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 15:22\nJust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 15:27\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m just trying to model so what I\u0026rsquo;m doing is I\u0026rsquo;m trying to model the\nsystem as it was described. So I\u0026rsquo;ll go back. So the first step in thread\nmodeling is understand the system. So model the system. So what we have\nis the user, right? The customer, not the user. Sorry. So I have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 15:53\nYou pushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 15:58\nI\u0026rsquo;m developing as we speak, right? So the repository I mentioned has the\nexercises from the previous iterations and has the base file to create these\nimages. And as we speak, I am updating the file. So this is not yet\ncommitted. I can commit it right away so that everyone can have it. And\nthen from there we can start working together if you want. So give me 1\nsecond to commit the code. I\u0026rsquo;ll commit it right away. Customer talks to\ncognito label equals. So this is provide username password. This goes over\nHttps and that\u0026rsquo;s it, right? So I will receive provide username and password\nso we can see that the customer is as I type, the image changes. So I have\nthe first relationship, provide username and password.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 17:10\nNow I can as a customer talk to the API and I can say label equals make\nrequests. And this is all again protected with Https and JSON web token.\nSo here we have an initial representation of the system in which we have\nthe customer talking to the API, the customer talking to Cognito to get the\nidentity. Now, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem complete, right? There is something\nmissing here. I don\u0026rsquo;t usually talk to an API, do I? So in order to be able to\ntalk to the API, I need to talk to something else that gives me the access to\nthe API, which sends me to Cognito to authenticate. So let\u0026rsquo;s say I have a\nsingle page application somewhere. Spa. No, not shape. Spa is my single\npage application. It\u0026rsquo;s react JavaScript, and this provides the UI for the\nuser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 18:52\nSo I have a single pledge application, provides a UI for the user. And\nobviously, the customer needs to talk to the spa label equals get the UI.\nAnd this is over Https, but it\u0026rsquo;s not secured with JSON web token because\nthis is basically me going to Amazon and reaching the page before\nauthentication. Right. The single page application will be the one running\non my browser, which will redirect me to Cognito to authenticate if I need\nto authenticate for buying a book. And then at some point, something has\nto talk to the database. So the API will be talking to the database, and the\nAPI will be talking to the database label equals, let\u0026rsquo;s say, get write data.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s unencrypted and admin user password. So that\u0026rsquo;s how we\u0026rsquo;re connected\nwith admin user and password.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 20:21\nI\u0026rsquo;m obviously creating a vulnerability on purpose so that we can find\nsomething easily, right? And this is a very high level view of what could go\nwrong. Now, there is something missing here. What is missing? So I can\nmake orders. How are books getting into this thing? So I need an admin\nuser, right? So now I have an admin user, or I need an admin user. So I\u0026rsquo;ll\njust copy the customer and paint it in a different color to make a\ndifference between or maybe not yet paint it in a different color. But let\u0026rsquo;s\nsay customer. Now it\u0026rsquo;s not the customer, but my admin. And now I say\nadmin. Admin is a person internal to the company bookstore admin. The\nbookstore admin has the function of updating. So let me zoom in so that\nit\u0026rsquo;s visible what I\u0026rsquo;m doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 21:47\nUpdating catalogs, or rather than updating updates. That just updates\ncatalogs, checks, orders. And what else was this person supposed to be\ndoing? So this person was also supposed to be doing adding books. So\nmanaging books, deleting books, posting and deleting books, getting\norders. Those are the three specific functions. So let\u0026rsquo;s see. Update the\nbook catalog, update book catalog, delete book and checks customer\norders. But there was something else missing, right? So what am I\nmissing? So I have get books, post books, delete books, get orders, post\norders from the customer, get orders. I\u0026rsquo;m missing the payment. Post\npayment. So I need to add a payment provider. Now, this is an\narchitectural decision that\u0026rsquo;s hard to undo. I can choose to do payment\ntransactions myself, or I can choose to use something like Stripe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 23:19\nIn my case, I could use a payment provider not to bother with credit card\ndata. So in this case, I will take a system outside of Amazon, say HTML\nout, so I make it gray to make it visible that it\u0026rsquo;s out of scope. I will not\nanalyze the gray stuff. I don\u0026rsquo;t care about the gray stuff. I care about how I\nintegrate with them, of course, but not how they do the business. It\u0026rsquo;s a\ndifferent process, vendor requirement, security, whatever, but not in scope\nfor the threat model. So I could say stripe. Stripe. Come on, stripe. It\u0026rsquo;s a\npayment provider. I could think of it as a SaaS, as a software, as a service,\nand it manages payments with credit card returns, a transaction ID. All\nright, so I have the things that I need to be able to operate now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 25:04\nI need to mix them. So I need my API to talk to Stripe and it will send\nvendor ID, send. What else will I send to it from the API so we can see the\nline gets generated automatically. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to generate it myself. API\nsends the vendor ID, what else does it do? It sends the vendor ID and the\namount. Sends a vendor ID and the amount this is an Https connection\nwith an API key. At least that\u0026rsquo;s how in my mind it works. I have no idea\nexactly how Stripe works, but I am assuming here that Stripe works this\nway. Now I have a high level context diagram. I still need to put my admin\nto talk to my API. And here I will use this label and this label will allow me\nto manifest the intention of the connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 26:43\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s say the admin updates book catalog and checks orders and this\nconnection is done over HTPs with adjacent web token as the\nauthentication method. So as you can see, the diagram grows as I type the\ndiagram, updates as I need it to update. So I don\u0026rsquo;t bother myself with\ncreating it in a visual way and moving things around for the reason that\nit\u0026rsquo;s a lot easier to have a bit of text, which I can keep in version control,\nwhich control the creation of this file, but I can diff them. I can do a lot of\nthings that make life a lot easier. So I can help readability by providing a\ntab here and making everyone basically use the same length. And it\u0026rsquo;s a bit\neasier to see the relationships here, but that\u0026rsquo;s just a basic readability\nlinting thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 28:05\nAnd the diagram is relatively simple, so there\u0026rsquo;s no need to do a lot of work\nto understand it and we capture the whole scenario. Now, what are things\nthat I could worry about? I could worry about injection, I could worry\nabout many things. Now we can also say, well, this will be hosted in AWS.\nThis will be made up of lambdas. Every API endpoint is a lambda. And I\u0026rsquo;m\nnot sure if you know Daniel Misler. So let me put on the chat the link to\nDaniel Misler\u0026rsquo;s page, 1 second. So there we have it. The other browser 1\nsecond. I\u0026rsquo;m posting it in the chat. There\u0026rsquo;s the chat. So here we have the\nlink, and for simplicity, I have summarized what he says on how to use AI,\nhow to shape or what he calls prompt engineering. So he has a seven step\nprocess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 29:44\nLet me put it over here. Come on. Thank you, so helpful. But I don\u0026rsquo;t need\nall your help. One out. So basically he says, okay, tell chat GPT who you\nare, tell the system what format it will produce, give it the task, give the\nsteps, tell it exactly how you want the output to look for, show it one to\nfive examples of ideal output and tell it what to include or not include. So I\nwas preparing this session by creating this step. So basically what we\u0026rsquo;re\nsaying is you\u0026rsquo;re an application security expert, threat modeling a system.\nYou will identify possible vulnerabilities threats in which the vulnerability\ncan be exploited and propose one or several countermeasures to avoid the\nvulnerability or prevent or detect the malicious action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 30:49\nThe output will be marked on table with the following fields ID\ncomponent, Actor, Vulnerability, Threat Scenario and countermeasures.\nThe system is hosted in AWS. The code is managed in GitHub. GitHub\nactions push the software into production. The system is a single page\napplication on the front end. The system consists of a single page\napplication which the user downloads. The single page application written\nin react interacts with the rest API calls in JSON users redirected\nauthenticated. The single page application is stored in an S three pocket.\nRequests are first landing in cloud front, then on the S three pocket we use\nCognito as the identity provider and we can do identity federation with\nGoogle, Facebook, Office and LinkedIn so that our customers can log in\nmore easily. And on the cloud side, we are fronting our API with AWS\u0026rsquo;s API\ngateway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 31:55\nHere the JSON web token will be checked and everything will be\nforwarded to a lambda. The lambda is written in Java or Dell. Lambdas\nplural are written in Java. They interact with the database using the\nHibernate framework RDS postgres instance is the database using what I\ntold you, the database admin to connect to it. We can add to that over an\nunencrypted connection. The password is configured as an environment\nvariable in the lambda function. The connection is not oh, I already had it.\nOkay, well, I can\u0026rsquo;t get it. The connection is not configured to be encrypted,\nso we can remove that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:43\nThis is a great prompt, man. You have to share it. It\u0026rsquo;s really cool.\nEspecially if we can abstract just a bit right. And just have the bit where I\nfill this bit here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 32:51\nWell, I\u0026rsquo;m following the recipe from Daniel, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 32:55\nI know, I know. But it\u0026rsquo;s a good practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 32:59\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see what comes out. So I just finished typing this thing. I have no\nidea what will come out of it. So I hope Chat GPT can run it. And if not,\nare you using your paid account?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:12\nAre you using four or 3.5?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 33:14\nThe free one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:16\nOkay, so then also put that on the Chat. Then I\u0026rsquo;ll run it on or push it to\nGitHub and I\u0026rsquo;ll run it on four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 33:21\nAll right, let\u0026rsquo;s see that. So I\u0026rsquo;ll commit this to GitHub as well. The\napplication has these user groups. So we have a customer which is\nexternal, an admin which is internal logging. We use log for J to produce\nlogs. Logs are captured and logs are captured and stored. Log entries are\nused for monitoring and debugging purposes. We can say they\u0026rsquo;re captured\nand stored in an S three pocket, so disconnected from a lock processing\nmechanism. So I\u0026rsquo;m introducing avalibility into the system to see if it\u0026rsquo;s cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 34:12\nBut can you see how cool it is, what you\u0026rsquo;re doing right now? You are\ndescribing the system, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 34:17\nI am. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s the same thing we already had, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 34:20\nI know, but it\u0026rsquo;s very different because in the past, remember, even the case\nwere talking yesterday, what would happen is you would spend some time\nwith the engineers, with the developers, with the architects, and you would\nhave this in your head, but you had no place to capture it or persuade.\nThere was no place that you would capture that you get a good reward\nfrom it, so you probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t capture it. Where now what you can do\nwith this is you can write this, and even if it\u0026rsquo;s going to the Dev team and\narchitects going, hey, is this correct? There\u0026rsquo;s already a lot of value in it\nbecause we already started to map the things. And then you apply the\nsecurity analysis on it, but you could also apply performance analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 34:52\nYou could also say, hey, find me usability problems, find me bottlenecks,\nfind me disaster recovery problems, find me performance. And let\u0026rsquo;s say\nfecal points of failure on the architecture from a resilience point of view.\nSo there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of interesting other questions you can ask, not just the\nsecurity ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 35:12\nAll right, sure, definitely. I agree with you. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of value here,\nright? So I\u0026rsquo;m just kind of creating my prompt. So let\u0026rsquo;s see, I have created\nthe persona, I have asked for the format, I have given task, I have given\nthe steps well, I have given the description of the system. I have told it how\nI want it. Now it tells me it wants five examples or one to five examples.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s create one example. Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s say again the output must be a\nmarkdown table and skip the preamble I don\u0026rsquo;t want it to blah, blah. Skip\nthe preamble. The ID field is a counter used to uniquely identify the fields,\nvulnerabilities and scenarios. This is an example. So that means I could\ncreate something that looks like this. I said I want ID. I want the\nvulnerability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 36:54\nI just mentioned it here. Oh, the component actor, of course, to know\nwhere the vulnerability is present. So let\u0026rsquo;s copy that thing and put it here,\nthe ID, control V, the component actor, the vulnerability, the threat\nscenario, and the countermeasures. Now I say one, two, 3123-451-2345.\nThis is a markdown table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:34\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to provide that. He\u0026rsquo;s going to do it automatically. Don\u0026rsquo;t\nworry about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 37:37\nPardon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:38\nHe\u0026rsquo;s going to do the table automatically. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 37:41\nI know, but I\u0026rsquo;m following his recipe in which he says, give it an example of\nideal output.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:46\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 37:46\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m going to create a very good credible attack vector to have it. So I\nwould say API, insufficient sufficient authorization checks. An attacker\nabuses the lack of sufficient authorization to elevate his rights to admin\nand reduce the price of an item. Countermeasures ensure authorization\nchecks are done at the API gateway and individual function. I\u0026rsquo;m just\nquoting the ASBs by heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:02\nYeah. The other thing we could have done eventually this is we could also\nfeed it a large chunk of the mean. We could also say here\u0026rsquo;s all of the SVS\nor the SVS that is relevant to this part. Then pick the ones that, in a way,\nare relevant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 39:22\nAll right. So I have all of this. Now I will copy paste it into GitHub so that\nDennis can run it in parallel. So give me 1 second to put it in GitHub. So,\nDennis, here you are. So let me add the file. Explorer OSS Threat Model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:43\nYou\u0026rsquo;re going to put that on the main branch or you\u0026rsquo;re going to put.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 39:45\nIt no, on the bookstore kata. So I have not committed yet. I will commit\neverything right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:51\nOkay. Yeah. So that branch is not there. Right? So you\u0026rsquo;re going to put it\nup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 39:54\nIt\u0026rsquo;S not yet there. Yeah, exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:55\nCool. All right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 39:56\nGood stuff. Prompt markdown. Oh, God. What did it do? What didn\u0026rsquo;t it\ncopy the thing? All right, try again. Feel better. Control v okay? Not again.\nLet me see if I can tweak it somehow. Better copy paste. Okay. I have no\nidea how to copy paste it. Then I can try to put it into okay, let\u0026rsquo;s see.\nControl. C I\u0026rsquo;ll put it into chat GPT. So here\u0026rsquo;s chat GPT. I have a new\nsession on Chat GPT 3.5. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if I can put it here. There it is. So now I\ncan select it from here. Post it there. Now it worked. So that means I can\nnow commit and paste. So give me 1 second to commit and paste. Okay, I\nthink I have too many things, so give me one instant to move this to the\nother side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 41:35\nSo I will add this into the.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 41:38\nBy the way, what\u0026rsquo;s really brilliant about Louis, what you\u0026rsquo;re doing here is I\nthink you\u0026rsquo;re really capturing. I would call the essence of threat modeling\nbecause I think a lot of people go, oh, threat modeling is know, it\u0026rsquo;s\ncomplicated stuff and all. Like no, like literally, this is almost the state of\nthe art of threat modeling. Right. We\u0026rsquo;re still figuring out we\u0026rsquo;re still\nmapping the things, and then we\u0026rsquo;re connecting the dots. Right. So this is\nexactly what happens in the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 42:01\nYes. It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be hard, right? It has something. Yeah, it has very few\nthings. I could have expected a lot more. It gives me a starting point.\nRight. So insecure storage and attacker gains unauthorized access to the\nS Three pockets, storing the single pitch application tampering or data\ntheft. Implement proper s. Three pocket Controls versioning. Not bad. I\nmean, easy pick. Identity provider, identity spoofing impersonate forging\nauthentication tokens or weaknesses. Enforce MFA. Not bad. Regularly\naudit and rotate secret keys. Monitor and log authentication events for\nsuspicious activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 42:55\nHey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 42:56\nFantastic. So far, so good. An attacker provides a forged or exponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 43:00\nHave you uploaded the code to your thingy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 43:03\nPardon? No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 43:07\nJust do it quickly because then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 43:08\nI was just too eager. But I\u0026rsquo;ll do it right away. I was just having so much\nfun. Give me 1 second to do it. So it add bookstore, qatar. All right, I have\nit. Kit, omit, book push, no trouble. So you could pull now if you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:13\nOkay, well, I\u0026rsquo;m going to grab it just directly from the website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 44:20\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s see. API, insufficient. JSON web token validation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:25\nOh, so you uploaded to Mania.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 44:29\nI uploaded to Mania. I just had a branch. Not a branch, but a directory for\nbookstore. I\u0026rsquo;m developing it myself so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to do a lot of\ncomplicated stuff here in the and it\u0026rsquo;s all text file, so it\u0026rsquo;s not too bad.\nNothing will break if I corrupt my own repo. Let me export the file. 1\nsecond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 44:55\nNo, I got it. It\u0026rsquo;s already generating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 44:58\nAll right. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if you can create a link or make a pull request to\nsee the output. So I\u0026rsquo;ll just basically I can share my screen or you can share\nyour screen. Even better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:11\nYeah. So I\u0026rsquo;ll share my screen. You got those. You got nine. All right, let me\nshare my screen. Okay, so where\u0026rsquo;s mine? Sorry, I was trying to find and\nwhat I\u0026rsquo;ll also do is I\u0026rsquo;ll show you some of the tricks. Okay? So you should\nbe able to see my screen. Chat GBT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 45:41\nYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:42\nCool. So you got application system experts. You got this, right? So API\nendpoints. So they go look. So look. Lambda database vulnerabilities,\nadmin accounts, and encrypted DB connection. Right. So these results\nbetter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 45:56\nThat one was not found by this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:57\nYeah. So you should be interested to compare both, right? Because. This\nshould be a little bit better, right. In these kind of things, four has a lot\nmore better context and understanding. So, look, use im roles for\naccessing the database. Single page application, expose the blue token.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s quite good. There you go. So we give a token look, HTP only. That\u0026rsquo;s\nquite good measures, right? Cognitive control over Google. So API,\ngateway rate limitation, the nail of service, GitHub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 46:35\nOh, you have more things because you have GitHub actions. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get\nany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:38\nYeah. Access to git repository. So there\u0026rsquo;s two ways you can tackle this. So\nI\u0026rsquo;ll show you a couple of tricks, right? Lambda, environment variables,\nAPI, endpoints logs in S three testing CI pipeline, APIs communication.\nRight. Where was that vulnerability that we put in? That was by default\nthat you put.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 46:59\nUnencrypted, unencrypted communication between the lambda and the\ndatabase. And were using admin database connection between the lambda\nand the database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:13\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 47:14\nAnd that wasn\u0026rsquo;t found. Right. So it does help you get the low hanging\nfruits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:22\nYeah. But for example, what you can do for here, so we could say, great,\ncan you focus on the connection between what was it with the two\nelements?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 47:32\nBetween the lambda and the database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:34\nBetween the lambda and the database. Right. So let\u0026rsquo;s see. There you go.\nSee? So one of the things that is really worth doing is going bit by bit. So\nnow I picked it up, right? See, lambda to RDS connection, unencrypted\nconnection there in transit could be intercepted by an attacker encryption.\nYou seeing that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 48:06\nI see it. I mean, that\u0026rsquo;s the last step in the recipe from Daniel, right? So\nthat\u0026rsquo;s why I like Daniel\u0026rsquo;s recipe so much, because it gives you a very good\nway to create a prompt and then a very good way to tweak the output.\nWhich is exactly what he\u0026rsquo;s saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:22\nRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 48:22\nTweak the output. Focus it on where you want to focus. So it gave us a\nvery good first pass with ten findings on something. But then we can start\nfocusing on the API, we can start focusing on the S three buckets on the\nlog collection or lack of log collection, et cetera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:38\nSo there\u0026rsquo;s two ways you can do this, right? You can keep improving the\nprompt here. One gotcha, which is a hack, is that remember that there\u0026rsquo;s\nstill a limitation on the prompt size. So eventually, if you keep doing this,\nyou\u0026rsquo;ll notice that the chattypt will start to lose data because the prompt\nsize is always the same. Right. So one trick that you can do is you can edit\nthis one here. See what I mean? So I\u0026rsquo;m going to edit this guy and I\u0026rsquo;m\ngoing to say so, for example, you have countermeasures. I could also go,\nlet\u0026rsquo;s say I\u0026rsquo;m going to go risk level probability, right? Actually, see, I don\u0026rsquo;t\neven need to do that, right? I could also go can you also add to the table\nabove? Risk level probability attack agent and let\u0026rsquo;s say impact, right, to\nbusiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:47\nSo what\u0026rsquo;s cool about this, right, is that now it should create a wider table,\nright? So you could see that expand the table. So increase that. See, look,\nthere you go. See what\u0026rsquo;s doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 50:06\nI know, looks nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:12\nAnd then the thing about this, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 50:14\nNo, the question here is, okay, you have a probability medium, but a high\nlevel risk to understand the likelihood of occurrence, right? Because risk is\na vector. So it works two numbers, right? An X and a Y. So we have the\nprobabilities, the Y, but we are missing the X.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:36\nWe do. But I always say that depends on the attack agent, right, or the\nattack based the attacker. Right? Because whether you have that attacker\nor not, because if you don\u0026rsquo;t have internal attackers, then the probability of\nsome of that stuff is happening is quite low, right? Like, for example, this\none, not between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 50:57\nThe Lambda and the database, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:58\nWell, between the Lambda database, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have internal attackers,\nit\u0026rsquo;s going to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 51:04\nHave here a high attacker, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 51:06\nWell, the risk is high. For example, for that one, the Lambda database. By\nthe way, I have a trick. So I created a little let me share my screen again. I\nhave a little JavaScript which I\u0026rsquo;ll share with you, right? But that basically\nallows me to do this. Can you see that? So I have a little script that just\nmakes GBT bigger because it\u0026rsquo;s really annoying that it\u0026rsquo;s quite limited,\nright? I have a little JavaScript that I can run on a page that hacks the UI,\nright, and see how nice this is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 51:49\nI know, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 51:51\nSo you can see. So in that example, you got the Lambda database, right?\nYeah. It\u0026rsquo;s high, but it\u0026rsquo;s because you have external attackers inside a threat,\nright? But then you got cognito. You got that. So I can now say, great,\nnow can you recreate the table? And this is one of the things I always find\nthat when I do thread models, I never like to mix external or internal, like\ndifferent type of attack agents, right? Basically who you\u0026rsquo;re defending\nfrom, because they will be different. And also your risk metrics should take\nthat into account. So I prefer sometimes to create the same thread model,\nbut from different points of view because everything becomes a lot more\nrealistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 52:40\nBecause if the business is going okay, so I\u0026rsquo;m really worried about attacks\nfrom the outside, then you go like this, because sometimes you might go,\nwell, the insider thread can do a whole bunch of other stuff. So this is not,\nyes, you could do this, but it probably can do even more things, or it\ndepends where you are. So I could say, look, now can you recreate the\ntable only from the point of view? Right? The table only from the point of\nview of external attackers with no to, I say low to mid level skills. Right.\nSo again, I\u0026rsquo;m not saying state actors and stuff like that. Now, it should be\nable to refocus a lot of this, what\u0026rsquo;s it called, the high, mediums and lows\nshould now be reclassified on those. Because now that\u0026rsquo;s what I would\nexpect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 53:49\nIt included new things, didn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 53:51\nYeah, well, it was out there in secured direct object references. Was that\nthere?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 53:55\nNo, I see either number three or four. Number two or three, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:01\nThere you go. From an external attacker. And we can classify this. So we\ncan also say what is our classification for this? What\u0026rsquo;s our classification\nfrom this? So that\u0026rsquo;s quite nice. Right. Because you remove actually, a\nbunch of the ones that are not immediately exposed from those skills. So\nit\u0026rsquo;s a lot more focused. S, Cloud, Front, Cognito API, Gateway API expose\nsensitive data and GitHub if it gets exposed. So this is pretty cool. Another\nthing you can do here, you could say, actually we can go back to the first\none and again we can edit. So I tend to do this quite a lot sometimes edit\nthe original prompt and you could say here, can you map in fact, this\nshould actually work. Can you see what I\u0026rsquo;m asking for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 55:04\nStride category.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 55:06\nYeah. So this is where the T from the GPT part is super critical because it\nshould now go to Stride and it should give it look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 55:19\nSee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 55:22\nHow cool is that? It understands what Stride means, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 55:30\nI know, but do you know how many times I have spent half an hours of my\nlife discussing whether something falls within this or that category of\nStride because it\u0026rsquo;s such a bad yeah, but that\u0026rsquo;s a threat category that I tend\nto skip it. But I see the value in this. I mean, I would rather map it to\nCAPEC, which is like a lot better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 55:54\nOkay. How do you spell that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 55:56\nC-A-P-E-C. CAPEC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 55:58\nC-A-P-E. Like that? Yeah. Okay. And by the way, the script that I was\ntalking about sorry, just because I got some BOOKMARKS, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to\nshare my screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 56:16\nI\u0026rsquo;m recording while you get there, we have a cool mel drews is asking any\npredictions or thoughts on how enterprises could make use of similar\ntechniques now or in the future? Considering with consideration to\nconcerns for sending organizational applications, security data to some\nAI, I think that\u0026rsquo;s part of the risk equation. Right. So having models in\nhand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 56:44\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s already addressed already. Because if you look at Open API,\nAzure Open API, and if you look, for example, at Bedrock, put this way, if\nyour organization is not using AWS, then you have bigger problems.\nRight? For example, if you\u0026rsquo;re using AWS, then AWS already has a mode\nwhere you can use Cloud Two that is locked. And if you\u0026rsquo;re using Google\nCloud, it already has Vertex that is locked. And if you\u0026rsquo;re using Azure also,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 57:12\nAnd if you have some sort of chat internal thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 57:17\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s a couple of variations, but it already completely addresses, I\nthink, Mel, that point. Right. And there\u0026rsquo;s an interesting argument here\nwhere the better we create the prompts, the better we create the\nmaterials, the less powerful model you want. In fact, if you really want to\ngo private, use Llama Two, right? And llama two is already pretty good.\nAnd again, and you can run that completely in your environment, your\ndata center, your local machine, and there\u0026rsquo;s different models of Llama. I\nhaven\u0026rsquo;t fully run it, but some guys I was talking to, it\u0026rsquo;s about between\nthree and ten grand a month. So depends on what size of the enterprise.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s already a reasonable cost and it\u0026rsquo;s going to come down. Right. Again,\ndepends on usage. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 58:01\nIf you have one person using, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s a lot, but if you have a lot of\ndevelopers and if you really have those requirements not to send things\nvery widely, then that makes a big difference. So, yeah, let me just share\nmy screen to see the output here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 58:15\nCool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 58:16\nCan you see? Yeah. So there you go. Right? Is that better for you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 58:23\nSo KPEC is really the better mapping thing rather than strife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 58:28\nYeah. Now, the thing about this is that this is what the guy that was doing\nthe attack gen thing is that some of these sometimes JBT does get these\ntend to get more the IDs wrong than these mappings here. So what you\ncan do is you can feed it to it, right? So you can actually feed for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 58:44\nYou can ask it to put the link, right? Now, if it\u0026rsquo;s linked, you can just click\nand check the.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 58:51\nThat\u0026rsquo;S the one, right? Common attack pants classification, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 58:54\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 58:57\nBut the other thing you can do with this is you could also say, see, look, I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t know if you\u0026rsquo;ve seen this, so I could also take this and I can basically\ngo a new one, right? And basically I can use the advanced data analytics,\nright? And I can then say I was actually playing with this and you can\nbasically say, can you create a visualization right of this application from\na thread model point of view? So in principle, this is the one that has the\ncode, right? So basically you could see that, first of all, it\u0026rsquo;s going to create\nthe table with probably a bunch of issues. In fact, I could have probably\ngiven the other issues. Right, see, so it\u0026rsquo;s doing that, but this is the one that\nhas the advanced data analytics. Have you used this before?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 59:57\nNo, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a paid subscription. Yeah, my company is not yet on Chat\nGPT. I\u0026rsquo;m actually supposed to be doing the analysis for the risk\nassessment, but when I\u0026rsquo;m done with that, we might be able to use it. But I\nmean, right now I\u0026rsquo;m on my private account just trying things that have no\nrelationship to my company, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:00:17\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really worth doing this because this part here, it is quite impressive\nand sorry, I\u0026rsquo;m just saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:00:44\nI assume based on the description, you could also ask it to stop right\nwhere we told it to create a table and tell him or tell it to create mermaid\ndiagram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:01:00\nExactly. That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do now. So you see, look, see the risk\nlevels? Okay, so basically it\u0026rsquo;s done this bit, right? You got this thing and\nnow you can go, great. Can you create, let\u0026rsquo;s say, graph visualization of\nthis data, namely the data application should be able to now this is the one\nthat has so you can see that now he\u0026rsquo;s mapping, right? He interacts single\npage authentication handed to government success authentication. The\nuser receives a JWT token. API requests are out to the API gateway. And\nmy point with all this is that we should still have, you know, this should\nstill be verified, right? But this is the one that actually erites the code. See?\nSo he\u0026rsquo;s using Matplotlib with network X. He\u0026rsquo;s going to create a graph.\nSee, look, there\u0026rsquo;s the nodes, there\u0026rsquo;s the edges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:02:15\nCan you see user, he\u0026rsquo;s adding the edges. He\u0026rsquo;s drawing the network, getting\nsome labels to it. Access request returns. And then he\u0026rsquo;s drawing the\nnetwork. And then when he raises bugs like this and then sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s\nfunny, right? He goes, oh, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, I should be using this one. Why\ndon\u0026rsquo;t you do that in the first place? But the other thing that is sometimes\nreally cool is if you have APIs that can do this, you could also ask it for the\ncode to execute in your end or the functions to execute in your end. And\nyou could also give it code samples. But the logic is that it just gives you\nthat acceleration, right? It just gives you that extra mappings and there\nyou go, right? So there\u0026rsquo;s one visualization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:03:03\nI mean, it\u0026rsquo;s something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:03:08\nSo you can actually map it up, right? Now, the one I was playing around\nbefore is like, for example, you could also ask to do a plan to ML. So you\ncan say, hey, give me the plan to ML code for this. And in your example,\nremember that you already had some of those modules. So you can say,\nhey, here\u0026rsquo;s the building blocks that I want. Now use those building blocks\nto do it. I think once we package this a little bit more, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be\nsuper powerful. And remember that it\u0026rsquo;s also about helping, let\u0026rsquo;s say you or\nthe more expert threat model person to review the materials. Imagine you\nbeing on the receiving end of this, but also you now communicate in\nprompts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:03:48\nSo you can capture your knowledge in prompts, or are you making the\noriginal prompts better, which is that much more efficient?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:03:59\nYeah, certainly this has just so much potential, right? It\u0026rsquo;s incredible what\ncan be achieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:04:09\nActually, the other one that you can do. Let me show you. This is while you\nwere doing that. Let me see if I can load it up here. I basically asked?\nYeah, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of okay, give me a second. See if this works. You kind of\npause in the middle. But see, the other thing you can do, check this out, is\nyou can take your diagram. Look at this. So what I did is I took this one,\nsee where you were literally a screenshot of your stuff and say, can you\nwrite a thread model for this application? And you wrote this, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:05:00\nNot bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:05:01\nPhishing attacks, denel of service attacks, API vulnerabilities, this. So it\u0026rsquo;s\nnot bad, right? Maps the thing that you have there. Yeah, actually, the\nother trick that you can do, which I also think is insanely powerful, is I\nwas trying to recreate the whole thing. The other thing you can do that is\nalso crazy powerful is we could also take that table. See, look, I think this\nis really cool. So I can take this table and look, just copy this, right? So\nI\u0026rsquo;m just going to copy literally this stuff and I\u0026rsquo;m going to go, okay, I\u0026rsquo;m\nliterally just going to paste that whole thing and say, hi, can you review\nfind blind spots in the thread model below. And you can literally just paste\nit like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:06:06\nSee how I\u0026rsquo;m not even formatting it correctly, but in a way Chat DBT can\ninterpret that way better than we. So this is what I think is really\ninteresting is when you do something and you go, hey, can you find blind\nspots? Can you look at other things that we could be looking at?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:06:28\nYeah, certainly. This has a lot of potential, right. It\u0026rsquo;s basically the\nbeginning of how to do threat models enhanced by AI. Looking at this\nfrom the business perspective, I am creating a security champions\ncommunity right now. And I don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of security expertise in the\ncompany to the threat models. Brilliantly. They will get there sometime.\nBut this can just turbocharge everyone\u0026rsquo;s abilities exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:07:05\nRight. And also, I think you could also drive a little bit the whole thing of\nthinking of and teaching and getting people to use OpenAI right. And Chat\nGPT because you\u0026rsquo;re also teaching them. Because look at this. So I can\nnow can you create a business analysis to provide to a business and\nproject owner to make the business case to spend time addressing these\nissues? So now, look, create a compelling business analysis, right? And\nthere you go. Right, okay. What is actually giving me okay, so this is a\nstructure approach. This is cool. Look. So you could see introduction,\nexecutive summary, introduction, analysis, financial analysis. This is not\nbad. So it gives you the thing now. Great. So now can you write one\nadding can you write one based on the data provider? Right? So now it\nwill draft a business one. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:08:23\nSee look. So now it\u0026rsquo;s going to give you a text that you can rewrite and you\ncan basically apply. So that\u0026rsquo;s blah and the grand through landscape or\nthreat model in five vulnerabilities, right? Look, see, bam, bang. And if you\neven know better who you\u0026rsquo;re going for, you can start to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:08:44\nReally you can describe the person\u0026rsquo;s role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:08:46\nDescribe the person, right? So you can say, Great, but that is too long.\nCan you give me the same with max one paragraph? Right? Yeah. But\nnow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:09:14\nThis is the kind of feedback that you could give a human and be punched\nfor, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:09:19\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:09:20\nSomeone could have spent hours doing this and then you say, come back\nwith one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:09:24\nExactly, right, but that\u0026rsquo;s the thing. In the past, this is my point. My point is,\nin the past, this would be really hard to do, right, because we do all this\nstuff and it\u0026rsquo;s super painful to do, right, and now you can go, okay, can you\nwrite that one paragraph for somebody that has no idea what\ncybersecurity is? Right? So you can now start to trick it, right? And then\nyou could see that the language changed, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:10:03\nI agree, world of Chat GPT is fantastic, but we definitely need to check the\noutput, right? So it is going to write for you very easily or very long text.\nNow you need to check them and make sure that they actually match\nwhat you want to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:10:22\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s the point. The point is that I think where people get in touch\nwith you wrong is that they shortcutting the last step. And the point is that\nit\u0026rsquo;s not about shortcutting the last step. The last step is still there, or even\nthe intermediate steps. The point is that the recreation of the materials is\nnow super easy. And like you said, you can go from big to small to change,\nto multilanguages, to adding mix or say, oh, he\u0026rsquo;s the language that we\u0026rsquo;re\nsupposed to do. Or, by the way, this analysis, or he\u0026rsquo;s a project report or\nwhatever, you can add lots of bits of data in ways that in the past would\nmake it very expensive. Because you have to go back and rewrite and\nthink about these things. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:11:01\nSo even little tweaks, you can say, oh, don\u0026rsquo;t use language like this, don\u0026rsquo;t\nuse words like this, use words like that. And then you can rewrite it. And\nthat\u0026rsquo;s the keys. The feedback loop now of creative materials is actually a\nlot more, which is really powerful. And if you look at the CATA stuff, I\nthink it\u0026rsquo;s really worth exploring that onboarding, that practicing. I like the\nfact that we can now create even games on this. In fact, look at this,\nright? So actually, let me give a really cool example. If I start from here,\nright? So let me take it from that guy there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:11:43\nYou\u0026rsquo;re not sharing your screen, just showing something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:11:46\nSorry. So if I start from. Look at this example. I\u0026rsquo;m going to take that\nexample of where were actually capex, see where were, where we got that\nlist, right? Okay. So can you now create a game and the set of questions\nand answers to teach a new developer, right. How to do thread modeling?\nThreat with a t. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. Although you actually would pick it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:12:22\nThread modeling, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. Threat and thread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:12:25\nOkay. But it understands the context. That\u0026rsquo;s the other cool thing. There\nyou go. But it\u0026rsquo;s fine, it\u0026rsquo;s better if you spell it properly, right? But now, Silo,\ncan you create a game and set a question and answers to teach a new\ndeveloper how to do threat modeling for the app above, right? So give it a\ncool name and use emojis. I usually go with taste, or else you can go quite\noff piece, right? So call Cyberslu thread defenders to engage. Right? There\nyou go. Look at this. Okay, so what\u0026rsquo;s cool about this is you. Okay, so it\u0026rsquo;s\nactually giving the answer, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:13:09\nCan you see?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:13:10\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s cool, right? Because it already gives you this, right? So you\nhave the thing. But can you see how really cool is to do a game based on\nthat particular application that is relevant to that particular thing? See\nwhat kind of risks associated with storing data like DB nine passwords in\nenvironments like lambda. Now, this is very relevant to whoever, to the\ndeveloper that wrote this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:13:41\nSorry, I see. What would be fantastic is I\u0026rsquo;ll put the output of chat TPT 3.5\nor. On the repo. If you could also add the output that you have been\ngenerating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:13:58\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:14:00\nWe could then create a branch on the Open Security Summit to keep these\nthings. Also, this is a place to start, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:14:08\nYeah. Look at the difference. See what happens now. So look at the power,\nright? See, look, see what happened. I could have gave him this, right? So\nI could have say, hey, based on this, now run the game. So that will be the\nprompt, right? So you could see that. Now you got this. Look. Welcome to\nCybersfluid. Your first misidentified, right? Walk, comment, blah, blah.\nAnd then you can go like this. And then you type the answer and then he\u0026rsquo;s\ngoing to give me a response, right, based on correct answer, blah, blah,\nfantastic. Identified. But the other thing you can do, which is quite funny,\nright, is I can come in here, right, and I can say, can you run for me? Can\nyou provide highly sarcastic answers, for example, right? So it\u0026rsquo;s not going\nto be for everybody, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:15:05\nAnd comments to the user, to the player responses, right? So I think this is\nnot for everybody. But look, so now I\u0026rsquo;m going to say let\u0026rsquo;s step to the world\nof this, right, with a good attitude, right? So you can see it\u0026rsquo;s going to\nchange a little bit, right? Oh, a new cybersecurity on this. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if you\ncan spot a vulnerability better than it can spot the laser dot, right? So let\u0026rsquo;s\nsay I\u0026rsquo;m doing the wrong one and now he\u0026rsquo;s going to go it should provide a\nnice sort of really? That\u0026rsquo;s a cute guess effect. That was chocolate teapot.\nBut don\u0026rsquo;t worry, there\u0026rsquo;s more fun ahead. Do you know what I mean? But I\nthink that this makes a difference, right? And you can even put into\ncontext. I\u0026rsquo;ll run this from the point of view of a retailer or a finance\ninstitution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:15:58\nYou know what, I\u0026rsquo;ll try this next week. I have my Cybersecurity Champions\nmeeting next week. I\u0026rsquo;ll provide an illustration of the system and I\u0026rsquo;ll let\nthem play the game. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:16:09\nSo what I\u0026rsquo;m doing with the Cyber Boardroom, right, is to try to create an\nenvironment that wraps this so that you don\u0026rsquo;t see the middle. For example,\nI\u0026rsquo;m using Chat GBT behind the scenes, but I, for example, just give you the\noptions and it will give you ABC, and then you click know, so it\u0026rsquo;s almost\nlike wrap a little UI from a board member point of view, but make it much\nmore interactive, much more kind of nicer. But the engine behind is sort of\nthis logic of Chat GPT, which is really cool, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:16:39\nIt is definitely good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:16:41\nAll right, man, this has been great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:16:45\nIt\u0026rsquo;s definitely a very different threat modeling session than I intended\nyesterday. But I think after discussing on scaling threat modeling, I really\nwanted to try a very good prompt for just flexing the prompt muscles and\nyou could see how it works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:17:08\nCan you see how a lot more effective you are when you\u0026rsquo;re finding blind\nspots versus creating from scratch? And I always felt that the problem\nwith most people doing threat modeling was the start, right? It was that,\nhow do I start? Where do I go? What\u0026rsquo;s the first? And then you go to stride,\nand it\u0026rsquo;s like guessing where even if jump. Hey, thanks, guys. Nice\ncomments there. But look, just what we\u0026rsquo;re doing here, literally, me and\nLewis, is what we do in threat model. This is what we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing for\nthe last ten years, right? Literally, we\u0026rsquo;ve been ad living figuring this out.\nEven the stuff that Louis now is already very comfortable doing. The plan\nto ML, I remember when we start using that, I was like, well, this is really\ncool. We can now visualize the threat model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:17:57\nSo I think what\u0026rsquo;s nice about our industry is still there\u0026rsquo;s still so much\nground to evolve, and practices like threat model are still very archaic if\nyou compared to what they should be. So there\u0026rsquo;s great space for\ninnovation, which is really cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:18:13\nIt is. It\u0026rsquo;s been a fun session. I know. Next open security summit. Let\u0026rsquo;s do a\ndifferent Qatar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:18:23\nOh, yeah. By then we\u0026rsquo;re going to have a bot. We\u0026rsquo;re going to have the Open\nSecurity Summit bot with us, right. Providing help and enhancing things\nlike this. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:18:33\nI mean, it took me about the same time it would have taken me to draw\nthe thing and walk through the case with creating the prompt. Right. So\nthe prompt was a lot of text and a lot of tweaking and a lot of following\nthe rules, but it\u0026rsquo;s given us a good result. So we could perhaps next time\nstart with a bath prompt, improve the prompt as we go to see how it\nimproves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:18:59\nWell, and to share it. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:19:02\nThe idea is obviously to share it in such a session and have the iterations\nthe prompts on a markdown file or something to keep it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:19:10\nYeah. And that\u0026rsquo;s one of the other bits I\u0026rsquo;m really looking at also, and\nplaying around with the boardroom bot is I\u0026rsquo;m creating three bots, right?\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ll go in detail the session, but I\u0026rsquo;m creating three bots, and each bot\nbasically contains Minerva. One is Athena, which does the board, the\nadvice. One is Odin, which actually does the backend stuff, and one is\nMinerva, who does the business stuff. So you kind of have a mix of\nmultiple bots playing together, which know when it works, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be\npretty cool. All right, man, this is good stuff. I think it\u0026rsquo;s been a pretty good\nsession. Man, this has been a really nice session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:19:46\nIt was really fun. Thank you for your interaction. I mean, it was great to\nsee how you use it. I saw your reading list for the summer and I was like,\nenvious of where you find the time to read so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:20:01\nYeah, but it\u0026rsquo;s like I was telling point the point of having those books,\nalthough I drove to Portugal so I could bring it, so my wife didn\u0026rsquo;t complain\nthat I brought a bag just for books. Right. But I felt that I had the books I\nneeded to read in the sequence that I wanted to read. And what that\nallowed me to do is allow me to go quite deep. And then one of the things I\nrealized was that the action was not in the models. The more depth I went,\nthe more I realized the history of it and where were and the innovations,\nand the more I understood how GPT worked, the more I realized that the\naction is not in the models is in the prompts, is in, maybe even be the\ntraining of it. Right. But that\u0026rsquo;s where I became quite interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:20:39\nBut I was able to almost read the book in sequence that I needed to. So I\nneeded the 30 books so I didn\u0026rsquo;t read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:20:46\nI mean, I remember your list was like ten books. So out of the ten, which\none was the best?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:20:52\nThere was a couple. I think the O\u0026rsquo;Reilly GPT transformers was really\ngood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:20:56\nAll right, so I\u0026rsquo;ll get that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:21:00\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s that one. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:21:02\nI\u0026rsquo;m using you as my chat GPT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:21:04\nYeah, you\u0026rsquo;re.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuis Servin - 01:21:06\nMy dean GPT. And I cut the ten books to one. That\u0026rsquo;s good enough for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:21:11\nOkay, cool. All right. Take care on that.

I\u0026#39;ve had co-workers make threat models that were fully different from what I would have done that were perfectly correct. \n18:41:58\t From Jonathan : https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/ \n18:47:26\t From Brook Schoenfield : For me, it was Izar and Matthew Coles who coalesced this now \n18:48:20\t From Brook Schoenfield : OTH, I thought that practitioners needed to get together not  as presenters, but as contributors since about 2011. There have been a few other attempts along the way \n18:53:31\t From Charles Weir : I had a slightly different question: who do each of the experts here see as the clients for their TM? Who’s the customer? \n18:57:42\t From Adam \u0026#34;surprise guest\u0026#34; Shostack : Charles, I prefer to ask “who are the participants” rather than clients \n18:58:23\t From Avi D : +100 Brook - and not just about security aspects either \n18:58:53\t From Adam \u0026#34;surprise guest\u0026#34; Shostack : And there, the participants are the people who are making decisions about the system \n19:01:26\t From Charles Weir : Adam, So the purpose is the learning, not a receiver of the ‘output’? \n19:02:18\t From Brook Schoenfield : these are both important, IMHO \n19:03:21\t From Brook Schoenfield : Learning: because most organizations are developing their skills and IMHO, all activity taken up during development must offer observable (and hopefully measurable) value \n19:03:23\t From Adam \u0026#34;surprise guest\u0026#34; Shostack : Learning is a great value, not the only one. sometimes the output is important, sometimes the journey is important. \n19:04:24\t From Izar Tarandach : Charles, I\u0026#39;d offer that learning is a great value and a by-product of the process. As Adam points out, the journey is important. Eventually we find out that more comes out  of the threat mpodel than just a list of threats and mitigations. \n19:06:50\t From Charles Weir : I was wondering too about the ‘what could go wrong?’ question. Does(n’t) TM put a restriction on the kind of what’s we’re looking for? \n19:08:16\t From Avi D : Charles, not necessarily, it depends on the model you want to use, and on your scope. \n19:08:20\t From Izar Tarandach : what kind of restriction do you have in mind? \n19:08:42\t From Avi D : There can be restrictions, but its not inherent to the doing of threat modeling.\n19:09:01\t From Adam \u0026#34;surprise guest\u0026#34; Shostack : TM™ doesn’t have an Official Answer to that. You can use STRIDE, LINDDUN, Kill Chain and be really specific or you can go beyond.\n19:09:23\t From Didar Gelici : shall we discuss this in the second half, live?   Otherwise the audience won’t have visibility on video\n19:09:44\t From Charles Weir : Avi, distinguishing TM and normal test design, I was thinking.\n19:09:56\t From Adam \u0026#34;surprise guest\u0026#34; Shostack : Sure! Can we also capture the chat and post it as an accessory?\n19:10:07\t From Didar Gelici : can do \n19:10:21\t From André Ferreira : I’m still a fan of “multi-dimensions model” after a brainstorm session based on STRIDE, wondering that the panel thinks of it \n19:11:45\t From Adam \u0026#34;surprise guest\u0026#34; Shostack : I wonder if some folks are intimidated by the idea of ‘multi-dimensional models’?\n19:12:11\t From Brook Schoenfield : In my experience, answer to Adam: unqualified “yes”\n19:12:53\t From Didar Gelici : good analogies !\n19:13:03\t From Jonathan : If you just joined us, manifesto is on https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/ \n19:14:39\t From André Ferreira : It was a paper by Jouini, Rabai and Aissa, 2014 which claimed to offer a richer taxonomy than STRIDE following principles of mutual exclusivity, exhaustiveness, repeatability, acceptability and usefulness. I believed that it would benefit from further sub-classficaitions, but noted that is very similar to PASTA. \n19:15:42\t From Charles Weir : Cardboard consultant?\n19:16:30\t From Adam \u0026#34;surprise guest\u0026#34; Shostack : “A Security Framework for Secure Cloud Computing Environments”?\n19:17:37\t From Adam \u0026#34;surprise guest\u0026#34; Shostack : Based entirely on the abstract, I think that models which try to integrate cost are harder to adopt than ones that don’t.\n19:18:21\t From Avi D : … unless cost as a factor is optional?\n19:18:22\t From Dinis Cruz : Question: Although onsite threat modelling session have lots of advantages, remote sessions (aka zoom ) have the advantage of allowing much more (key) talent to participante. What best practices can you share on how to run those virtual sessions (maybe backed with a couple participants in a meeting room)? \n19:18:55\t From André Ferreira : On what can go wrong?\n19:19:58\t From André Ferreira : On what can go wrong? What would be looking there? Would you sub divide it in to: entry/exit points, external dependencies? Would there be a common set for guidance? \n19:20:26\t From Adam \u0026#34;surprise guest\u0026#34; Shostack : Dinis, 99% of the answer is how do you run effective remote collaboration, and 1% is threat model specific.\n19:21:16\t From Adam \u0026#34;surprise guest\u0026#34; Shostack : André, entry/exit is one way of looking at ‘what are we working on’, and dependencies are also part of that.\n19:21:29\t From Jakub Kaluzny : Remote collaboration that does not store sensitive data (threats) in the 3rd party cloud app :)\n19:21:55\t From Robert Hurlbut : +Adam’s answer\n19:22:48\t From Izar Tarandach : Andre, on \u0026#34;what can go wrong\u0026#34;, I like to think about it in two parts - \u0026#34;what are the possible modes of failure\u0026#34;,  meaning, how would I know the system is misbehaving, and then, what can lead to those modes. \n19:22:49\t From Dinis Cruz : Ok Adam, do you have good tips on to run effective remove collaboration?  :)\n19:23:01\t From Adam \u0026#34;surprise guest\u0026#34; Shostack : Also, to the 1% remote TM specific, Agile Stationery has a card-dealing tool https://croupier.agilestationery.co.uk/ \n19:23:05\t From Tate Crumbley : What are folks thoughts on threat modeling features as compared to systems?\n19:23:32\t From Didar Gelici : the croupier still requires each player to have deck of physical cards\n19:23:32\t From Adam \u0026#34;surprise guest\u0026#34; Shostack : Dinis, lots of retrospectives :)\n19:23:37\t From Brook Schoenfield : Hey, Chris, Robert joined!\n19:23:50\t From André Ferreira : Thanks Adam, on that point, guidance for common points on “what are we working on”. I was wondering if you guys considered further subdividing the 4 points as to offer more guidance. \n19:24:54\t From Jakub Kaluzny : Actually finding an offline whiteboard/diagraming that is currently maintained is not that easy. All Miro/Creatly/Mural etc. synch with the cloud.\n19:25:05\t From Dinis Cruz : Question: what can we do at the next onsite summit to make it work for onsite and remote participants?\n19:25:41\t From Brook Schoenfield : Wise words, Adam!\n19:25:49\t From Didar Gelici : cheeky @Dinis\n19:28:27\t From Adam \u0026#34;surprise guest\u0026#34; Shostack : André, we chose not to for the manifesto, but tools like STRIDE, LINDDUN help answer ‘what can go wrong.’ My (very quick) take on that paper is that they’re thinking they need a ‘complete’ methodology, and that fits the ‘perfect representation’ anti-pattern.\n19:29:08\t From André Ferreira : To tackle the limitations in know-how from the modellers (memory included), what are in your opinion the best resources? I recall having a very hard time trying to figure out vulnerabilties DBs while learning TM \n19:29:46\t From André Ferreira : Adam, thank you for that\n19:31:13\t From André Ferreira : Makes a lot sense. Make iterative and deep dive only where needed, I guess\n19:33:36\t From Jakub Kaluzny : Fully agree - TM as a metric for pentest (and vice-versa).\n19:34:38\t From Grant Ongers (rewtd) : 100% Brook. Security is a part of software quality... one of many NFRs.\n19:35:41\t From Brook Schoenfield : Apologies for going on.\n19:36:03\t From Grant Ongers (rewtd) : Threat Modelling is how we scope our (security) tests... Especially if we do TDD in building software.\n19:37:14\t From Jakub Kaluzny : Without TM, a pentest would be more bounty hunting :)\n19:37:32\t From Avi D : Jakub, or running scanners ;-)\n19:38:49\t From Izar Tarandach : it is important, i think, to call out that testers usually test \u0026#34;to spec\u0026#34;, while security tests (should) focus on \u0026#34;to break\u0026#34;. These are very different mindsets, and the TM helps bridge between them.\n19:39:01\t From Grant Ongers (rewtd) : Heh... Avi, that\u0026#39;s what they mostly look like.\n19:39:54\t From Tate Crumbley : Thanks!\n19:40:07\t From Grant Ongers (rewtd) : But that the security equivilent of fuzz testing for functional tests...\n19:40:37\t From Adam \u0026#34;surprise guest\u0026#34; Shostack : Threat modeling swag store: https://agilestationery.co.uk/pages/threat-modeling-tools\n19:40:40\t From Jonathan : Tendency to Overfocus\nhttps://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/#principles\n19:41:02\t From Charles Weir : I wonder if the question might be ‘What might go wrong related to security and privacy?’\n19:41:23\t From Grant Ongers (rewtd) : Adam: yup. Needs more t-shirts / hoodies. will you tell Devika?\n19:42:05\t From Avi D : @Izar that’s what ASVS is for :-)\n19:42:17\t From Izar Tarandach : +1 on ASVS\n19:42:38\t From Jakub Kaluzny : TM-ing a full system or each story has a cost (mostly time), and it\u0026#39;s pretty easy to overcomplicate. I often advise to decide first which stories are worth to model.\n19:42:48\t From Avi D : That is pretty much “pentesting to spec” :-)\n19:44:21\t From Izar Tarandach : @Jakub with the realization that at first we might not know what stories are out there. They emerge as the system progresses. That\u0026#39;s why I push CTM with a decision by the developer of \u0026#34;is there security value in this particular story\u0026#34; \n19:44:36\t From Jakub Kaluzny : \u0026#34;Thumbs up\u0026#34;\n19:45:14\t From Avi D : +1 Izar\n19:46:16\t From Charles Weir : @Jonathan - how do you approach the ‘TM without the expert?’ problem?\n19:46:43\t From Brook Schoenfield : if a threat model identifies 1200, then you’re being paid for vulnerabilities by the pound!\n19:46:52\t From Grant Ongers (rewtd) : Expert in what @Charles? THe system? What can go wrong?\n19:46:56\t From Tate Crumbley : Looking at a feature without the context of the overall system threat model sometimes leaves us wanting, looking at it bottom up. I do like looking at it top down. Getting a model that devs can reference (ala Brooke) is a holy grail for me.\n19:46:59\t From Brook Schoenfield : Out of 1200, your customer will do absolutely nothing\n19:47:17\t From Grant Ongers (rewtd) : /registers domain...\n19:47:35\t From Jakub Kaluzny : That\u0026#39;s what base threat models are for. You have 30mins budget? Draw a diagram, mark \u0026#34;web apps\u0026#34; \u0026#34;mobile apps\u0026#34; , \u0026#34;AWS \u0026#34; etc. and use BTMs, best practices, ASVS, etc.\n19:47:35\t From Jonathan : rofl :)\n19:47:42\t From Brook Schoenfield : @Avi: I do that all the time. But do they buy? ahem\n19:49:46\t From Avi D : Heh. Make the “not buy” more expensive ;-)\n19:50:04\t From Avi D : (Not that I am such a sales expert lol )\n19:50:17\t From Didar Gelici : OWASP Slack?\n19:50:22\t From Dinis Cruz : Question: What are good topics for next month’s OpenSecuritySummit (2nd week in January)\n19:51:15\t From Avi D : Didar a lot of folks are there, so can catch us there but not really an “official” channel\n19:51:22\t From Grant Ongers (rewtd) : @Dinis: \u0026#34;How to make sherpas of your developers for the TM journey\u0026#34;\n19:51:25\t From André Ferreira : It would be great to see “Threats categorization”, pitfalls, different ways of applying it in practise\n19:51:39\t From Didar Gelici : you can create a twitter account for the Manifesto\n19:51:40\t From Jonathan : https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/#principles\nuse this to challenge yourself and people (it will get you in trouble but it\u0026#39;s going to help)\n19:51:54\t From Jonathan : (this=patterns/antipatterns)\n19:52:10\t From Jonathan : PODCAST https://podcast.securityjourney.com/the-threat-modeling-manifesto-part-1/\n19:52:20\t From Jonathan : PODCAST Part 2 https://podcast.securityjourney.com/the-threat-modeling-manifesto-part-2/\n19:52:26\t From Didar Gelici : yoda cameo -most fun session \n19:52:32\t From Jakub Kaluzny : The thing is to get this to a wider audience. I hope that all people on this call, or all that follow OWASP already model the threats :)\n19:54:15\t From Grant Ongers (rewtd) : Treat all sessions as remote - and still pay for the venue?\n19:54:24\t From Jakub Kaluzny : Thanks a lot!\n19:54:33\t From Avi D : Grant that’s just for the beers\n19:54:35\t From Grant Ongers (rewtd) : Ooops...\n19:54:36\t From Mel Drews : Thanks all!\n19:54:45\t From Grant Ongers (rewtd) : +1 Avi!\n19:54:47\t From Nissim H : Thank you all\n19:54:49\t From Avi D : lol\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e","date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2020/mini-summits/dec/threat-modeling/","event":"mini-summit","expirydate":-62135596800,"facebook":null,"fuzzywordcount":2200,"hey_summit":"https://post-summit-sessions.heysummit.com/talks/threat-modeling-manifesto/","image":null,"job_title":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752075784,"layout":"","linkedin":null,"notes":null,"objectID":"997b6c9653599bcf2e629999d941cbfe","organizers":["Avi Douglen","Jonathan Marcil","Chris Romeo","Izar Tarandach","Kim Wuyts","Brook S.E.

id=\"about-the-session\"\u003eAbout the session:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;In this talk I will address a critical aspect of all organisational resilience mainly cybersecurity and how to convey the criticality of the solutions, expenditure and long-term investment to senior management. In an era where digital landscapes are evolving at an unprecedented pace, the need to fortify our defences against cyber threats has never been more urgent. Turning the tide in our favour requires a concerted effort, and a key component of this effort lies in convincing senior management and ownership to invest substantially in cybersecurity measures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will cover during this talk how to articulate the tangible risks that our organization faces in the cyber realm in a way that meets the language of the business owners and senior leaders, removing the normal approach of “tech washing” and hit your business leaders with solid, facts , figures and the irrefutable facts that will make gaining the consistent level of investment possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe then move on to how you demonstrate the potential impact through concrete examples and case studies will help senior leaders understand the gravity of the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe then move onto how it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to highlight the evolving regulatory landscape. Governments and industry bodies are increasingly stringent about data protection, and non-compliance can result in hefty fines. Investing in cybersecurity is not just a proactive measure; it\u0026rsquo;s a legal obligation that safeguards our organization from severe financial penalties and legal consequences. Emphasizing the cost of non-compliance and the potential legal ramifications will underscore the importance of cybersecurity as a strategic imperative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom here the talk track moves into how, we must present cybersecurity not merely as an expense but as an investment that yields long-term benefits. A robust cybersecurity infrastructure enhances our operational efficiency, protects intellectual property, and fosters customer trust. By showcasing how cybersecurity measures contribute to a positive return on investment (ROI), we can shift the narrative from a necessary expenditure to a strategic initiative that fortifies our competitive advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur closing aim is to help those in the room build a vocabulary and approach to garner support from senior management, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to speak their language. Translate technical jargon into business metrics, illustrating how cybersecurity investments align with overarching business goals. Emphasize the potential for innovation and growth that a secure digital environment can foster positioning cybersecurity as an enabler rather than a hindrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe then will lastly, cover cultivate a culture of cybersecurity awareness throughout the organization. Train employees to be the first line of defence against cyber threats, turning them into assets rather than vulnerabilities. A well-informed and vigilant workforce not only reduces the risk of successful cyber-attacks but also showcases a commitment to cybersecurity that resonates with stakeholders. Having the whole business talk cyber-security and push this to the senior leaders and how doing so strengthens your resolve and will leverage the spend you need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion our talk , “Turning the tide” favours robust cybersecurity and how this requires a strategic and persuasive approach. By presenting the risks, emphasizing legal obligations, showcasing long-term benefits, aligning with business goals, and fostering a culture of awareness, we can convince senior management and ownership to make the necessary investments. Together, we can build a resilient organization that thrives in the face of evolving cyber threats.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"publication\"\u003ePublication:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlanet IT Blog\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2024/mini-summits/Jan/Governance/","event":"mini-summit","expirydate":-62135596800,"facebook":null,"fuzzywordcount":600,"hey_summit":"https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIof-ugqTguG9BFrY1fyvyPbpENNQ6LzXVh","image":null,"job_title":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752075784,"layout":"","linkedin":null,"notes":null,"objectID":"d22721528863d27c6df129890be36e3c","organizers":["James Dell"],"permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/turning-the-tide-how-to-convince-senior-management-and-ownership-to-invest-in-cybersecurity/","project":"Risk and Governance","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":3,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/turning-the-tide-how-to-convince-senior-management-and-ownership-to-invest-in-cybersecurity/","section":"sessions","status":null,"summary":"\u003ciframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRteMLILbOtcocExIXvMLkN5lpLj3B1Fi-dPG-NwlTb1pXRMXaDMULs92_ij-fCng/embed?slide=id.p/embed?start=false\u0026loop=false\u0026delayms=3000\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"960\" height=\"569\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-the-session\"\u003eAbout the session:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;In this talk I will address a critical aspect of all organisational resilience mainly cybersecurity and how to convey the criticality of the solutions, expenditure and long-term investment to senior management.

In this talk, I’ll show how developers can use \u003cstrong\u003eruntime code analysis\u003c/strong\u003e to find security flaws as they code. Code analysis happens continually as developers work in their code editor, presenting security findings and interactive visual code maps in real time. For an additional layer of protection, code is analyzed again in CI. Examples of flaws that are detectable by runtime code analysis include: leaking customer data \u0026amp; secrets into log files; missing or improper authentication or authorization; unsafe data marshaling; unsafe handling of user-provided parameters. We will discuss how these specific examples of common flaws can creep into web apps, and I’ll show how runtime code analysis alerts developers to these problems while they are still in their flow and more likely to make prompt fixes. This talk will feature an open-source developer runtime analysis tool called AppMap that provides visualization and can be programmed to provide security analysis.

In this talk, I’ll show how developers can use \u003cstrong\u003eruntime code analysis\u003c/strong\u003e to find security flaws as they code. Code analysis happens continually as developers work in their code editor, presenting security findings and interactive visual code maps in real time. For an additional layer of protection, code is analyzed again in CI. Examples of flaws that are detectable by runtime code analysis include: leaking customer data \u0026amp; secrets into log files; missing or improper authentication or authorization; unsafe data marshaling; unsafe handling of user-provided parameters. We will discuss how these specific examples of common flaws can creep into web apps, and I’ll show how runtime code analysis alerts developers to these problems while they are still in their flow and more likely to make prompt fixes. This talk will feature an open-source developer runtime analysis tool called AppMap that provides visualization and can be programmed to provide security analysis.

Welcome to this open security Summit in June 2023. And we have\nAndrea, one of our heavyweights in application security, expanding on his\nthoughts on actually a very interesting area of security, which is the\napplications language negotiation, and he\u0026rsquo;s going to give us a bit of a run\nthrough on where we are. And then we\u0026rsquo;re talking about maybe doing a\npanel in one of the next summits. But this is a great introduction of this\nquite interesting topic that it was mentioned that there\u0026rsquo;s some interesting\nways to exploit it. So, Andrea, over to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 00:32\nCheers. Definitely heavyweight. That\u0026rsquo;s a good one. I\u0026rsquo;m actually quite\nheavy at the moment. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty accurate. Thank you for that. So I\u0026rsquo;ll start.\nSo if you ever wondered why you get bombarded by a particular type of\nadvertisement in your own language when you\u0026rsquo;re browsing the World\nWide Web, or if you\u0026rsquo;re just curious of how websites function in different\nlanguages, or you just want to understand a bit better what happens and\nwhat are the consequences of specifying your language preferences? This\ntalk might be for you. And I will only require that you have used the\ninternet before, most specifically the word my web. And since you\u0026rsquo;re\nprobably seeing this online later, if you\u0026rsquo;re not here, you will qualify and I\nhope you find it interesting. So, during the Pandemic, me and the wife,\nwere living in a north facing apartment in London, in Dublin, actually,\nsorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 01:26\nAnd we passed a lot of our time watching TV series. And being that we are\nfrom opposite ends, opposite seat edges of Europe, we communicate\nmostly in English, despite the fact that we manage quite a bunch of\ndifferent languages altogether. I managed to speak Portuguese, English,\nFrench and Spanish, and she speaks Lithuanian, Russian, English, and she\nunderstands a bit of Spanish as well. But regarding what we can watch\ntogether, we are somewhat restricted to English. So one of the shows that\nwe used to watch was called A Place In The Sun. And if you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar\nwith it\u0026rsquo;s one of those shows that people from the UK and Ireland buy\nproperties in southern countries, apartments and houses, and that kept us\nentertained during the Pandemic. Now, influenced somehow by the show,\nand due to some other more pressing needs, we did some financial\nexercises and gymnastics and we figured out a way from Ireland and it\nwas supposed to be temporarily, but we did have the aim of making it a bit\nmore permanent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 02:27\nSo last year we moved to Spain, and me being from Portugal and having a\nsimilar skin tone as the Spanish in a large forehead, sometimes the local\npeople talk to me in their language and I\u0026rsquo;ve just lost my train of thought.\nThey speak to me in the language and mostly I understand what they are\nsaying and I feel very comfort when that happens because it means that I\nactually fit in, I don\u0026rsquo;t stand out, but when it\u0026rsquo;s my turn to respond, I have to\nnegotiate back that conversation into Castellano. So in Spain you might\nhave this perspective that everybody speaks Spanish, but in reality they\nspeak Basque, they speak Catalan, they speak Valencian and other\nlanguages, and castellano is what we know as Spanish. And this\nnegotiation is not very different from what happens on the World Wide\nWeb. And although there are many different ways of serving different\nlanguages, in this talk I\u0026rsquo;m going to focus on the Http way in proactive\nlanguage negotiation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 03:32\nAnd let me kick in. I can change the slide, which I\u0026rsquo;m not able to. It just\ntakes a bit. So my name is Andrea Ferreira and I hold a master\u0026rsquo;s degree\ninformation Security for Northumber University in the UK. And I\u0026rsquo;ve\nworked in the It space for more than two decades for small and large\ncompanies. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked in different markets, I\u0026rsquo;ve worked in different\ncountries, and if you need a trustworthy person that can give you a hand,\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently available. A cool thing about me is that my name is common\nand I share it with many other individuals. And we all have an accent, an\nacute accent on the e, and the slides take a little bit to pass. We got it. So\nwhen we think of something that we want to share, be it words spoken or\nwritten or gestures, those are symbols for ideas, emotions or information\nthat we want to transmit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 04:34\nAnd when we want to make our messages understood, preferably the way\nthat we thought about it, we need to have some rules, we need to follow\nsome rules. Now, this communication process must follow also a protocol.\nWhen a person talks, the other one listens, and the communication has to\nbe done in a language known to both and preferably pre negotiated to\navoid situations like Palivu francimpa Avenue spanol no by now, or, and\nthis one is going to sound funny, I took Calvinia to Viskai taip Bascan bins\nuse Monai, which will be something like do you speak Lithuanian? Yes. Let\nme call the wife, because it\u0026rsquo;s a language that it\u0026rsquo;s very hard for me to\nlearn. Now, in early life, we also found or we also learned that words are\nmade up of individual letters and those two are part of the overall\nprotocol that we required in order to communicate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 05:29\nSo communication shouldn\u0026rsquo;t still be thought about having two radios\nplaying music at each other, because there\u0026rsquo;s no communication taking\nplace. Communication needs to be thought as the successful exchange of\ninformation and perhaps it will surprise you, but there\u0026rsquo;s 8324 spoken\nlanguages and sign languages that are currently documented and in the\nplanet we have 7000 of those languages currently in use. And with all\nthose languages, having a universal translator could save us from having\nto know that many languages. And we know that from Sci-fi. This will\nwork great when we have to communicate with aliens as to try to defend\nourselves from something stupid that we\u0026rsquo;re going to do. However, there\nare some devices that already exist to help us with this. When I was\npreparing for this talk, I\u0026rsquo;ve stumbled across this is still a bit slow vasco,\nwhich is a device from a company based in Barcelona, Spain and their\nreviews in Amazon are actually quite encouraging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 06:30\nI have no affiliation with the company and if you watch recently Google I\nO you also saw a person being translated in real time from English to\nSpanish with their limps matching what was being said. So the future\nadvancements in this area look quite promising and that is until of course\nwe meet somebody like Arturis or have our own C Three PO because then\nthings will get much more interesting, I think. Now, language is not only\nabout conveying meaning. There\u0026rsquo;s an associated culture and a diverse\nhistory behind it and details matter. And as an example, you might have\nalready learned this, but Portuguese words Munto Brigado do not actually\ntranslate to thank you, although it can. But historically from Latin it\nwould be more closer to I recognize an obligation to return a favor to you\nin the future. Mutagarit Sidu, on the other hand, would be closer to thank\nyou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 07:26\nAnd these cultural juices along with slang and the detestable, acronyms\nand abbreviations are all part of an identity that translations need to\naccurately represent, which basically makes us think that sometimes we\nneed to have subtitles for some things that will be translated and diving\nsuper fast into history. Computer history with long jumps from the time\nwhen an American professor ran a camp a wire across campus, electrified\nit and used it to rang a bell at the far end of campus to the invention of\nMorse code. As a way to transmit information fast and far distances from\nmechanical typewriters and teleprinters that were later adapted to\nmainframe computers to the creation of Request for Commons 20 US.\nASCII. Humans have invented and discovered a lot in the last 200\ncenturies, in 200 years and focusing particularly on us ASCII, which has\nseven bits that allow the representation of 128 cold points being that the\nfirst 32 are control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 08:30\nCodes that you will use for controlling devices, all devices, and also for\nmagnetic tapes and all of the other codes from that being the alphabet\nand numbers and punctuation. Humans have discovered a way to use on\nand off or one and zeros to represent language. Now, US ASCII has been\na great American invention but very pragmatic towards their particular\nneeds and very insufficient when it comes to represent more than 8000\nlanguages. For example, if we grab my name, it can\u0026rsquo;t actually be\naccurately described in US. ASCII because of the lack of the acute accent\non the e. And the way that this basically works is if you look at this table\none from the first row, where you have 64, 30, 216 and so on, you have a\nstream of bytes. So you have like seven bytes. And if it\u0026rsquo;s a one, you will\nadd the value that is on the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 09:22\nAnd when you sum them all together with the bytes that you have on your\nright, that will give you a number 65, 110, 120, and that can then map to\na character to be displayed on the screen. I stress again that the US ASCII\nis not eight bits. It\u0026rsquo;s not an octet, it\u0026rsquo;s seven bits. And perhaps I could\nforgive the Spanish department responsible for issuing my driver\u0026rsquo;s license.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s the second time that it comes wrong because the first time\nthey got the surnames order wrong. But my first name was right. It had\nthe acute e there, but this time around they came with the order right, but\nit\u0026rsquo;s missing the e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 10:00\nSo, Andrea, at least you didn\u0026rsquo;t got like a SQL error or you didn\u0026rsquo;t got a call\nand said, hey man, why did you just crash half our database?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 10:09\nYeah, the first error was actually quite interesting because in Portugal we\nhave first the surname of our mother and then our father, and then Spain,\nthey have it the other way around. So when it came, I had it corrected\nbecause I have other documents that need to match exactly the same\norder. But this one, when I saw it, I just had to laugh because I thought it\nwas really funny. Now, because US ASCII is limited and to be able to\nrepresent other languages, us ASCII got extended throughout the years,\nother car sets were developed and we have examples here of what they\nare. But it got to a point that it was really complex because different\nmanufacturers had their own thing, and when they needed to translate\nfrom one car set to another, it was messy. And this is where Unicode came\nin. And Unicode allows you to map 150,000 characters, more or less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 10:57\nNot so many, but almost 150,000, which is way more than 128. And it\u0026rsquo;s\nreally pretty smart also because you can represent most characters well,\nsome characters with only eight bits. But if you need more, then you can\nhave 16, and then if you need more, you can have 32. So it\u0026rsquo;s a variable\nand car set. Now, when you buy a new computer, it should ask you to\nspecify the language that you want to use it in, unless somebody else has\nalready done that for you. And the operative system language will allow\nyou to interact better with the device. And if that device comes already, the\ncomputer comes with, or even if it\u0026rsquo;s a Mola comes with a default browser\ninstalled, it will probably be following the language of the Operative\nsystem. And if you go to the internet, then if you connect that device to the\ninternet and you go to a page and you want to download another browser,\nyou\u0026rsquo;ll probably see that web page on the same language as you have on\nyour computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 11:53\nAnd let\u0026rsquo;s imagine that page would be this source code. This little bit of\nsource code that I have on the right would represent a bit of the HTML\nthat Web page gives back to you. So I want you to observe that there\u0026rsquo;s a\nlittle piece of text that identifies lang equals Ang, which is the abbreviation\nfor English. And that page is actually with a car set equal to UF eight, utf\neight. So a trick question here would be, do we really need utf eight for a\npage that is in English? But if we wanted to translate this page and we\nwanted to put it in Portuguese, then lang would equal PT, and the Shar set\ncould probably also not be utf eight. That lang is an attribute. That\u0026rsquo;s what\nit\u0026rsquo;s called in HTML. And this particular attribute assists screen readers to\ndetermine the language of the Web page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 12:44\nAnd the goal of the Web is to be inclusive. And so if your company has\nclaims of inclusivity, this is something that you want to take care, that you\nhave to avoid some future brand damage or just add it as a tick box\nexercise in your release checklist. Now, when you have an HTML page,\nyou need to save it in a hard drive in a server so that in that same\ncomputer, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a program that will serve Web pages when you get\nsome requests that you\u0026rsquo;ll just sit and listen for when somebody wants to\ntalk to it. And you need to take care when you save the file with the right\nencoding, because otherwise the contents on it will just displace on\nGbrush. And it\u0026rsquo;s something that, throughout the years of my experience, it\nwould have saved me a ton of work and a ton of, well, not losing a lot of\ntime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 13:36\nIf I actually got a pop up like this one, that would actually tell me that,\nhey, there are some characters here. In this case, not so much smiley faces,\nthat will not actually display. Also, apart from this, there\u0026rsquo;s care that needs\nto be taken when we use some tools, even from known sources, because\nthey might actually tell us that something is right or wrong and it\u0026rsquo;s not the\ncase in this particular scenario. I tested Google.com on W three C Tool,\nand he was telling me that the Google.com page was coming back in\nPortuguese for some reason, and the fact is that it was coming fine in\nUTFA. So I also want you to notice that there\u0026rsquo;s a Translate equal yes on\nthe first image one, and that helps most modern browsers translate the\nWeb page for you. And some of them don\u0026rsquo;t actually need you to install a\nplugin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 14:28\nYou can do it just by right clicking the page. However, in some cases, you\nmight actually find that it\u0026rsquo;s not really desirable to have that translation\ntaking place. You want to set that to no. And the only browser that doesn\u0026rsquo;t\nseem to respect. This is Safari and I have a fundamental problem with this\none, which led me to report a security issue to Apple. But I\u0026rsquo;ll get into that\nin a little bit later. Using the Mac OS as an example, it allows you to\nspecify the languages that you want and you can set one as primary and\none as secondary. In this particular image you can see that I have my\nlanguage set up to English. And when I install applications, if for some\nreason the application is not available in English, then it will use my next\npreference and in this case would be Portuguese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 15:16\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re curious why I actually use English and not my native Portuguese,\nit\u0026rsquo;s just because out of habit of working with different operative systems\nand different versions of Windows, Linux, Unix and macOS. And if you\nignore my original settings, if you look further at the bottom, you will\nnotice that I have some settings on particular language that I want to use\nbrowsers in. And that works too. And it doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually depend on the\nlanguages that I specified for the operative system. That means when I\nactually open Chrome, Opera or Safari, I\u0026rsquo;m going to get them in the\nlanguages that I have specified. MacOS also allows you to do translations\noffline and I use a few. However, when you get to Safari, it always uses\nonline translation. And I also have an objection towards this. So when I\nwas testing the functionality of using the global attribute to translate on\nweb pages to see exactly how browsers would behave, I found some bugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 16:12\nBut most importantly, I got upset when I saw that Safari didn\u0026rsquo;t actually\nrespect that. I said translate into no. And I came up with a scenario where\nsomebody is using an Internet intranet, not intranet web page and it\u0026rsquo;s\ntabled as confidential and they translate that page. And what happens is\nthat page has to go through the network and to a bucket that is in\nAmazon owned by Apple. And the preference that I actually have of that\nnot happening was if I actually had it specific as a no, somebody had to go\nand change the source code to yes so that no accidental translation would\ntake place. So a part of that I also thought, well, if this has personal\nidentifiable information or the sensitivity on the file is really big, we would\nnot be very happy to share this with Apple. So I put this to them, but they\ncame back and said, no, this is not a security issue, nothing to see here,\nmove along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 17:06\nI disagree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 17:08\nBut then again, just to clarify, so you\u0026rsquo;re basically saying that when you\u0026rsquo;re\nbrowsing Safari and there\u0026rsquo;s a need in the text that there\u0026rsquo;s a language\nmismatch within who you are and what you\u0026rsquo;re seeing, the Safari would\nactually send the text of that page to an Apple server for translation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 17:29\nNo, the user will still have to do it you will have to ask for the translation\nbut you can claim that you did that accidentally. And it\u0026rsquo;s like a defense in\ndepth type of thing. When you set the transition into no and just by having\nit there, I will feel way more comfortable. It would be something else that I\nwouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to put in the procedural debt check for this traffic if it\u0026rsquo;s\ngoing to the bucket on Apple that goes over there or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 17:53\nYeah, because that page, whatever you\u0026rsquo;re watching could have all sorts of\nconfidential information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 17:57\nRight. I was thinking that even not only for the military, but you might be\nworking on your intranet which is supposed to be kept inside on something\nthat is very sensitive, you\u0026rsquo;re going to launch a new product, something like\nthat. And I\u0026rsquo;m like this shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be there. And the fact that all the other\nbrowsers actually respect all of the modern browsers that\u0026rsquo;s the ones I\ntested in respect to no, I was like, why are they doing something different\nhere? Although Apple does have differences, as we will see in next slide, is\nin other things. This one upset me a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 18:24\nYeah. It is a security issue whether there\u0026rsquo;s a control in place if the\nbehavior is different and data is executed. I agree with you, man. It\u0026rsquo;s a\nsecurity issue. We can argue on the criticality of it, but we should not be\nable to argue on whether it\u0026rsquo;s an issue or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 18:43\nI actually saw that the fines were so expensive towards the respect of\nGDPR that I put some numbers when I wrote the report to Apple guys, I\u0026rsquo;m\nsaving you this. And I thought I was going to get an incredible bounty and\ngo on vacation to somewhere even more exotic. But yeah, they didn\u0026rsquo;t\nagree with me. So if and when I have to take care of another company\nand there is confidential information in an internet, this is something that\nI\u0026rsquo;ll definitely want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 19:09\nNever publish that as a finding, right. Regardless. And even get a CWE for\nit because I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good example of some unintended side effects,\nbasically of a lot of the stuff we do that we don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of visibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 19:21\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t know that I could do that, to be honest with you. So let\u0026rsquo;s take that\noffline and we can work on that. That would be very cool. Very cool.\nThanks for that. Let me kick off because I still had a lot of stuff here. So\nmost browsers, including Tor, will allow users to specify your preferred\nlanguage. Safari is the one off, the odd one off. And by setting your\nlanguage preferences you\u0026rsquo;re basically agreeing and stating that you want\nto have those preferences shared with the websites that you\u0026rsquo;re going to\nnavigate. And this images on the left are from Firefox and represent my\npersonal language preferences and the way that this reads and you\nbasically have these drop downs that these options that you can move up\nand down to specify the order of your preferences. I prefer to receive my\ninformation in Portuguese from Portugal but if that is not available then I\nwould like to get it in Portuguese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 20:12\nIf that\u0026rsquo;s not available, I prefer British English, but if not available, give it\nto me in English French from France and if that\u0026rsquo;s not available, I can read\nFrench and Spanish from Spain. But if that\u0026rsquo;s not available, Spanish. And\nif for some reason the server doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any of those preferences, you\ncan pass to me a page in Chinese that I will not be able to read, or you can\nsend me an error code. And that\u0026rsquo;s pretty much how this preference works.\nBecause Safari didn\u0026rsquo;t actually allow for specifying my preferences and to\navoid people from having to install browsers or browser extensions or\ninstalling proxies that might actually share information that you\u0026rsquo;re not\nthinking that it happens or sharing your surfing. Experience with third\nparties. I thought it would be cool to share a way of living off the land, so\nto say. Or so to speak, and show a way that you can actually specify your\nlanguage preferences if you\u0026rsquo;re so inclined to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 21:09\nSo in this images here you can see that I\u0026rsquo;ve opened the developer toolbar\nand under sources I specified a local override. Now and this images show\nthat I got Amazon.com to return to me in Portuguese when Safari is\nactually set to English. Now curiously enough, you will see that they don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave the entire website available in Portuguese as this pop up is in white,\nit\u0026rsquo;s in English which undoubtedly states that their default language or\ntheir fallback language is in English. But you\u0026rsquo;ll get familiar with the\ndetails of the override a bit later in this talk. For now just rejoice that you\ncan get Safari to respect your language preferences even when they don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave another way for you to do so. But the reason that Apple actually I\nbelieve at least from the research that they actually took that off was\nbecause of fingerprinting. And now according to the latest Http\nspecification browser fingerprinting is a set of techniques for identifying a\nspecific user agent and track that over time using its set of characteristics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 22:10\nAnd there are a number of request headers which we\u0026rsquo;ll look into that\nmight reveal information to servers and that will be sufficiently unique to\nenable that fingerprinting to take place. And one of those headers is the\nAccept Language header. So I thought that it would be interesting to see\nthis actually in practice. So what I\u0026rsquo;ve done is that I\u0026rsquo;ve used tool called\nCover your Trucks. If the slide will move, sorry, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to click too\nfar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:39\nThere you go, I can see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 22:42\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve devised four tests using Cover Your Tracks and one of the I use the\nfour browsers in their latest version and macOS. And in the first one I used\nthe regular window and I specified my four language preferences I\u0026rsquo;ve\nshared before. The second one, I used the private incognito window, and I\nkept those as well. And then on the third one, I removed all of the\nlanguage preferences. And on the fourth, I use again the private window.\nNow, before you say anything, I am aware that the private window is only\nsupposed to not store information on my website regarding the websites\nthat I viewed, but I\u0026rsquo;ve tried it nonetheless. And if we look at the table and\nwith the information that we have on the site, according to their website,\n33 bits is all that is necessary 33 bits of identifying permission is all that is\nnecessary to uniquely identifiers in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 23:32\nAnd the way that the browser characteristics, including the language\npreferences or the amount of identifier information that is available for\ntrackers and for online advertising is very high. In Chrome, Firefox and\nOpera, if I have my language settings specified. Now, the same happens on\nthe private window. But curiously, Opera was giving me a different value\nand I went under the hood and I tried to figure out what was going there.\nAnd Opera has decided that in their private window, rather than having\nmy four language preferences, they reduced that down to one. So in a way,\nthey actually made it a bit more private. And that explains why it\u0026rsquo;s not\nlonger a unique fingerprint, but a nearly unique, so it gets a better value.\nAnd then when I removed all of the language preferences, we can see\nacross all browsers that there is less amount of information available to\nbeing unique identified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 24:28\nAnd then I got curious and I was like, I got a security tool here installed on\nmy computer. I wonder if they will actually make it a bit better. And I run\nthe tests again and let\u0026rsquo;s see if the image will pop. There you go. So I had\nNordVPN. I have no affiliation with it\u0026rsquo;s just a tool that I actually had. And\nI enabled thread protection and I run the test again and exactly with the\nsame parameters, exactly the same browsers, and I got better results.\nNow, I run this around 02:00, 03:00 in the morning, and I apologize for\nthe upper results on when I remove the language preferences, because\nthose values are not exactly correct. And I\u0026rsquo;ll explain why. The reason\nbehind that is that I have two screens. I have this one and the one, when I\nlook to the left, I\u0026rsquo;m looking at my other screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 25:13\nAnd when you actually have a browser in a different screen, the\ncharacteristics that are shared with that particular tool will be different.\nSo I believe that 1651 would be probably because I somehow had the\nbrowser on the left side. Not very scientific and accurate to me. I\napologize for that. But nonetheless, the results, we can actually see that\nthe tool improves a little bit. The ability that trackers will have to\nfingerprint us, but that they are still nearly unique. So in summary, if you\ndecide to specify language preferences, you know that your user engine\ncan be uniquely identified. While some online trackers may not know your\nname, this allows them to have a detailed behavior profile of your online\nactivity, political affiliations, education level, your income brackets, your\ntastes. And this means also that lifting cookies will not help. And perhaps\nthis is food for thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 26:07\nAnd you\u0026rsquo;re probably thinking of testing this tool yourself and I recommend\nthat you do so if you have the time. But I have a story to share and I\u0026rsquo;m\ngoing to move from here, so I\u0026rsquo;ll try to keep you entertained. I had two\nquestions that I needed answers to and I had ruminated about them for\nthe best part of two weeks since I had discovered that a book existed. And\nduring that time I had managed to resist the temptation of getting a copy\nas ahead of the priorities and my time and attention needed. It was needed\nelsewhere. And not to mention that I have several books here that I\u0026rsquo;ve\nalready purchased and they are still waiting to be read. But I got to a\npoint that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist anymore. I had two questions and those\nquestions were this moves did Tim and Ted really share a meal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 26:56\nAnd did Tim ted tell tim. Did Ted tell Tim? It sounds funny. All this is just\nFTP with lipstick. Now, I knew that Tim\u0026rsquo;s parents were both academics\nand in computer science. And I knew that Tim has a degree in physics, so I\nwas more than 100% convinced that he had to be familiar with Dad\u0026rsquo;s\npublications. But this was all fresh to me. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t come across this before\nand around 1965, if that one will come. There you go. Ted Nelson.\nProfessor Theodorhome Nelson had written an article or paper, a file\nstructure for the complex, the changing and the indeterminate policy. Now,\nthe paper is incredibly interesting and it details his vision of a dream file\nand its design. And while I was reading the paper, I would love to know\nthe professor\u0026rsquo;s opinion about Google Docs revision functionality, because\nfor me, while I was reading, it was like, yeah, they have this, yeah, they\nhave this, yeah they have this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 28:01\nSo I don\u0026rsquo;t know if they actually went there and read the paper from the\n1960s and achieved all of that or not. I would love to get the professor\u0026rsquo;s\nopinion. I thought it was really interesting. But in this paper, the professor\nalso coined the term hypertext in the mathematical sense of extension. And\nyou may not be familiar or ever heard of a project called Xanadu that also\nstarted in the 1960s by the same professor. But it was a project that\naddressed similar issues that those that Tim Bernersley had to solve in\nCERN. In the in a nutshell, both men had the ambition to improve the way\nthat researchers. Track knowledge. And a lot of it had to do with the way\nthat references function and references between papers on how to link\nthem. And to be honest, I don\u0026rsquo;t really recall if I read that paper first or if I\nread an interview with the professor where he actually shares that Tim\nand Ted had shared a meal and that I was curious to find out if he actually\ntold Tim that he thought that Http was only FTP with lipstick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 29:06\nSo that stayed with me for two weeks. And then I just got a copy of the\nbook and the book is Weaving the Web from Professor Tim Bernersley. And\nwhen I came about the FTP with lipstick I was like say what? And I got\nreally intrigued. So I needed to know more. And when I read the book is\nreally easy to read and it\u0026rsquo;s very interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 29:34\nThat\u0026rsquo;s an amazing book, man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 29:35\nThat brings me it\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 29:39\nI remember reading that book and really understanding the web and\ngetting this is going to be massive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 29:45\nI think the description of all the problems that he had and if you grab\nZenadu and you see when you read the book, it just starts to come\naltogether. There\u0026rsquo;s bits like they\u0026rsquo;re really human, it tells a human story.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s people that own money to some other people. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to spoil\nthe book to anyone, but the answer towards did they have a lunch? Yes,\nthey did. But what they ate and who paid for it, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to read the\nbook as well. The answer is there. And before talking about the Http\nprotocol because this is a story basically to do an introduction to that\nthere was a very interesting sentence I thought that professor also has in\nthe book and it\u0026rsquo;s this one I happen to come along with the time and the\nright interest and inclination after our protect and the internet have come\nof age that left me was to marry them together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 30:42\nAnd I thought this was very honest and I really enjoyed it. So when two\ncomputers agree that they can talk, they have to find a common way to\nrepresent that data so that they can share it. And this is also another\nsentence from the book from Tim Bernersley and this is where protocols\ncome in. And protocols, a protocol is a set of rules and controls in the way\nthat computers exchange data. And this comes from the Cambridge\nDictionary. But Tim Bernardzini\u0026rsquo;s book also says that the internet is a\nnetwork of networks. Its essence though is the standardized protocols, the\nconventions by which computers sends data to each other. Now, in the 90s,\nthis in the early 90s, but before no, sorry, so in the early ninety s the\ninternet had already evolved from what was called in the past ARPANET\nand that was a network developed by the United States Defense\nDepartment and it was controlled by them in collaboration with some\nuniversities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 31:41\nBut then other networks started to appear and those networks didn\u0026rsquo;t\nspeak to each other. So there was the same type of a complexity that we\nhad to do with us ASCII of the representation of language or characters in\nthe screen. The same problem started to exist with networks. And this is\nwhere the IP range of protocol or IP protocol suite comes in, as it will\nenable the communication between networks that don\u0026rsquo;t actually speak the\nsame language. So IP, the characteristic of IP, which is most interesting is\nimagine that you want to visit from your browser example if the route is\nnot always the same. So you\u0026rsquo;ll have to go from your computer to the\nprovider, your Internet service provider, and then they will know somehow\nhow to get to example. But even when they know that path, it\u0026rsquo;s like when\nyou\u0026rsquo;re driving there\u0026rsquo;s other roads to get to the same place and if one of\nthose roads is interrupted, the protocol knows how to find another path to\nget there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 32:36\nAnd the TCP on the other hand is a very reliable protocol. If it was human\nstocking, it would be a bit like this I would say hi and you\u0026rsquo;d say hi back\nand I would acknowledge that you\u0026rsquo;d say hi, so I know that you\u0026rsquo;re listening\nto me and then we can communicate. And the difference towards UDP is\nthat in UDP I\u0026rsquo;ll just say something and I don\u0026rsquo;t really know if you listen to\nme or not. And that was what enabled the World Wide Web to come into\nplace. Now, if we look into a better way of actually thinking about this, it\u0026rsquo;s\nby using the OSI model. The OSI, I didn\u0026rsquo;t say that correctly. Open systems\nintercommunication model. And you have seven different layers. So you\nhave the application layer, you have the presentation session, transport\nnetwork data and physical. And this basically means that from the point\nthat you want to transmit some information from your browser, the\ninterface that you\u0026rsquo;re interacting with and you are asking for example, bits\nhave to be converted into different meanings so that they go from all of\nthose until they actually get into zeros and ones and get sent throughout\nthe network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 33:43\nAnd this is basically used this table or this model for coordinating the\nefforts between systems intercommunications. And it basically describes\nwhat needs to happen and which protocols need to exist. So you get a\npacket out through the network. So let\u0026rsquo;s focus in an Http request and it\u0026rsquo;s\ncomposed of three lines of text and the first one, it\u0026rsquo;s called a request line.\nAnd here you can see the Cat method and it\u0026rsquo;s asking for examples.com.\nDefault resource at port 80, which is implied by the protocol used Http.\nAnd he also informs that he would like to communicate with version 1.1 of\nthe protocol. And I\u0026rsquo;d like to prove that to you now, I\u0026rsquo;m not using a browser\nhere. Oh wow. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually share wait, let me stop here. Or does it?\nThen I can\u0026rsquo;t actually see it. Can you see two other windows?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 34:41\nYeah, I can. To text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 34:46\nCool. Thank you for that. I can\u0026rsquo;t actually see it here for some reason.\nCool. All right, so I\u0026rsquo;m using a tool called Curl. I\u0026rsquo;m not using a browser, but\nthis will function in the browser exactly the same. In one, I\u0026rsquo;m calling http\nexample. In the other, I\u0026rsquo;m adding a port and I\u0026rsquo;m specifying the resource\nthat I want. So this is just to prove that if the first is exactly the same as\nthe first, but by convention, normally we don\u0026rsquo;t put it there. A caveat,\nthough, is that sometimes that default resource is not actually index\nHTML because you can specify in the server a different one. So sometimes\nit\u0026rsquo;s safer just to call the domain if you\u0026rsquo;re after an home page. Let\u0026rsquo;s read it.\nThat. Now, another part that happens behind the scenes, even with Curl\ntool is what that first request line actually what happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 35:38\nSo when the browser sees that example, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t know its IP because\ncomputers in the network, computers are known by IPS, they\u0026rsquo;re not\nknown by name. And the browser will try to see if he already knows the IP\naddress of example. And if he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know it, he will ask the operative\nsystem, hey, do you know the IP of this particular domain? And the\noperative system will look in its own cache. And you think about cache as\nbeing a temporary storage of information. And then if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t know it,\nyou will have to go into the network and ask somebody that knows it. And\nthat is part of the DNS protocol, which is a bit outside of this talk. But\nanyway, there\u0026rsquo;s negotiations to get to the IP so that the request can go\nforward. And the reason that this existed, that it alleviates all the\nsynchronization that needed to exist in our own computer if we needed to\nknow and keep track of all the changes and all the domain names and\neverything that keeps on changing on the Internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 36:34\nSo that responsibility is delegated. Now, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably mention this first\nwhen we ask for in the example before that, I gave what I actually got\nAmazon.com in Portuguese, they have their default page in English. So\ndifferent resources may have exactly the same content, and those are\ncalled variants. The reason for that, or better yet, there\u0026rsquo;s a principle that\nit\u0026rsquo;s actually mentioned in the book by Professor Tim is that each resource\nshould have its own unique Uri, that\u0026rsquo;s a Uniform resource locate\nIdentifier, uniform Resource Identifier. The names changed, and he was\nalso not happy about that. So bear with me. And in this case, it\u0026rsquo;s example\nindex HTML, being that the resource is indexhtml. Now, in principle, as\neach resource should have its own URL, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to call\nAmazon.com and expect that URL Uri not to change, because then the\nprinciple of uniqueness is violated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 37:48\nAnd the reason for that is that if you want to be precise into the linking\nthat you have, you want to refer to the resource exactly as is. Another\nexample is because this doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen only with language. You can have\na page in HTML, but you can also have it in PDF and those are variants of\neach other and they should reference each other, but they should have\ndifferent URLs as well and the service should try to accommodate for that.\nNow the other two lines here are headers. Let\u0026rsquo;s see if the image changes\nand it\u0026rsquo;s not changing. There you go. Cool. So headers are composed of\nlines and the line starts with a name, followed by a column file, followed\nby a field body. In this case, example, if you look at the host one, and it has\nto be terminated with a carriage return or a line feed, but it has to follow\nsome rules and those rules are actually you know what, I\u0026rsquo;m going to end\nhere, but let me finish this bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 38:52\nSo the names have to follow us ASCII because Heathers use us ASCII,\nwhich is, remember this, seven bits. And it has to have values between 33\nand 126, which allows for some verification of the input, is actually\ncorrect. And the body of the header, it follows the same, but also allows\nfor space and horizontal tabs, but it can break into multiple lines. And this\nfolding has actually been used for a lot of hacking, not particularly with\nthe exact language, but it\u0026rsquo;s something that we will see on the second part\nof this talk, because I\u0026rsquo;m going to end it here because I already see that\nwe\u0026rsquo;re doing this for 58 minutes and yeah, that would be this for today, and\nI\u0026rsquo;ll follow up in the next talk. Thank you for your attention. I got a lot of\nother slides, guys, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to stop it here because otherwise it\u0026rsquo;s way\ntoo much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:49\nOkay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 39:52\nMaria, I lost track of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:58\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s 44.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 40:01\nOh, God. But I had 1 hour on my timer here. So if you haven\u0026rsquo;t stopped, I\u0026rsquo;ll\ncontinue then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 40:10\nYeah, continue for more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 40:12\nYeah. All right. Sorry, let me share that. Wait, how do I do this? Wow, this\nis pretty slow. Let me just pull that. Bear with me. I\u0026rsquo;m just trying to get to\nthe same point that I was here. Okay, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure whether it\u0026rsquo;s still doing\nthis, but let\u0026rsquo;s see. Can you see it? Can I see?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 40:58\nYeah, I can see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 40:59\nOkay, cool. Let me move on to the next one. So this is an example of some\nfields that are sent by Firefox in its latest version in the macOS. And you\ncan see that the browser is sending information to the server and it\u0026rsquo;s\ntelling it that he wants to go to a host. In this case, a refrain website. And\nit accepts HTML and text application and XML. And he has a strong\npreference around it, which is the Q Nine that I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about in a different\nslide, and then that it prefers a Viv images or WebP. It also is able to\nunderstand Jzip and deflate PR and it would prefer to receive the\nresources in the languages, the order of my preference. And then it\nidentifies its user agent with a big string that doesn\u0026rsquo;t really represent a\nuser agent because of fingerprinting in the Mac, that Mac version for\nexample, they stop changing it because they wanted to stop fingerprinting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 42:04\nThat accept language is the one you say that actually creates quite unique\nIdentifier tracker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 42:09\nYeah, as we saw before, if you actually have it as big as mine that will\nincrease the way that I\u0026rsquo;m fingerprinting. But the trade off always here is\nthat I\u0026rsquo;m going to get exactly what I\u0026rsquo;m after. So it will be me as a user that\nyou have the freedom to say I don\u0026rsquo;t really care that you track me or I care,\nor only share that with particular websites. Because the problem with the\naccept language Heather, is that if you have never visited a website before,\nevery single resource, and imagine that there\u0026rsquo;s 150 images on the\nhomepage, all of them are going to get that except header. But in reality\nthat doesn\u0026rsquo;t help. Well, it would help if the content negotiation was done\nfor every single image to get a representation in Portuguese. But in most\nwebsites the images are not actually translated, it\u0026rsquo;s mostly the content, the\ntext, so it becomes a bit wasteful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 42:57\nBut on the other hand, the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s a proactive negotiation, it saves\nyou from actually having to get a page and then going through the flags\nor the drop down and selecting a language so that it\u0026rsquo;s actually faster. But\nyeah, as soon as you specify this you\u0026rsquo;ll be further tracked or your\npossibilities of tracking you are superior and let\u0026rsquo;s zoom into that. So in the\nslide we have exactly the same headers and we can see that the first\nlanguage that I have, Ptpt, is actually called a sub tag and it\u0026rsquo;s composed\nof languages that are request for comments that specify what those values\nare. And there\u0026rsquo;s also ayana registry that keeps track of all of the ones that\nare registered so that you can actually use. So validation can actually be\nachieved against that registry. And let me actually read the slides here\nsome recipients treat okay, so regarding the order of the languages as I\nhave it, you might notice that Ptpt and then PT actually have a quality\nvalue of nine because that\u0026rsquo;s what it means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 44:05\nAnd if I had other languages that had that nine, that had some bugs in,\nsome have had some bugs in the past where this actually existed and\npassed and crashed the server. But the composition is pretty much detailed\non the specification and there are requests for comments in all of them.\nThere are some caveats that the forward slash privateusing grandfather\nuses, not something that I personally, with my experience, I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen\nused, but I have not. The maximum that I had to work with was 16\nlanguages in a single website. I never had more than that and I didn\u0026rsquo;t\nwork in word processing or language more intensive type of applications. I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t work in the operative system level so I\u0026rsquo;m guessing those would\nactually be used there. And when you don\u0026rsquo;t actually specify a quality level\nso for example, you only say, I want English, then that pretty much means\nthat, yeah, the quality value is one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 45:07\nAnd that breaks down to more or less something like this with the values\non the table on the left side being the specific values that I\u0026rsquo;ve specified\nwhen I actually put them in order in my preferences. Now some of the\nadvantages of this proactive content negotiation is that it avoids the\ncommunication to go back and forth and the server does not need to\ndescribe how it\u0026rsquo;s actually going to look at your preferences and how it\u0026rsquo;s\nactually going to make the choice. So the fact that I have Portuguese\nspecified does not mean I\u0026rsquo;m going to get a Portuguese page. If there is one\nthat is in French and English is also not available, they will serve that how\nthat happens is transparent for the client. It\u0026rsquo;s logic that sits with the\nserver. However, the disadvantage, one of those that I\u0026rsquo;ve already\nmentioned is that it\u0026rsquo;s a bit wasteful making it a bit inefficient and there\u0026rsquo;s\nrisk for privacy though that fingerprinting that we\u0026rsquo;ve discussed, it\u0026rsquo;s a\nmatter of choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 46:06\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll have to decide exactly if that nearly unique fingerprint does not\nactually mean unique fingerprint and you\u0026rsquo;re tracked either way and you\nrather get consume content the way that you want to consume. There has\nbeen a lot of abuse with the language except feather and these are some of\nthe cases. There are CVEs that are open so you can actually send\nsomething even bigger than mine. You can specify there\u0026rsquo;s a limit but it\u0026rsquo;s\nnot in the specification of 8000 bytes if I\u0026rsquo;m not mistaken, on this total size\nof the Accept header. And in the first versions of Http that used to be sent\nin as plain text, it became binary from Http two. So that actually meant\nthat anyone on the network, if you have a man in the middle, somebody\nthat is listening and wiretapping your connection, they actually get access\nto all of those language preferences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 47:01\nBut then again, if they are wiretapping you, they pretty much know who\nyou are because otherwise they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be wiretapping you with\nlanguage preferences, you\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing that and if you sent in very large\nones that would crash some servers. And the CV is that if you want to\nverify it, then there was a way to craft some packages, some values that it\nwould create a loop on the server. You started thinking and when I saw\nthis one. I thought it was interesting because the details of the CV don\u0026rsquo;t\nactually specify exactly how this happens. But if you look at the way that\nit is composed and if you start looking at the string and you want to\nexplode it by, say, the semicolon and if you set because we are abusing now\nthe accept language header. And all the values that you have is semicolons\nand the computer is also parsing that you\u0026rsquo;re basically consuming time and\nthat slows down the server.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 47:54\nIf you send a ton of those you could pretty much crash the server as well.\nThere was also bugs where if you don\u0026rsquo;t actually send any language the\nsystem would crash in. Others that I found very interesting is if you\nactually specify JavaScript as your Accept Language value, that will also\ncause problems in the server others that you can also think about. So if\nI\u0026rsquo;m requesting a page in Portuguese and there\u0026rsquo;s one in English, and the\nlogic on the server side would be grab parse that string, grab the piece in\nEnglish and grab a file from the folder that is called English. That would\nallow for path transversal. And I could actually say get me the etc\npassword file by just specifying that in the HTML in the Accept language\nheader. It\u0026rsquo;s just a way to exploit it. Or you could also include other files\nand get them displayed to you and SQL injections that you mentioned\nbefore, they were also available there because now the server side could\nactually have the languages in a database and they could do a select web\npage where equals English and then it allows for SQL to be abused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 49:04\nNow I\u0026rsquo;m very upset with this slide because at this point I actually wanted\nto use Stride for it but I didn\u0026rsquo;t get a chance and I was actually thinking\nthat I would manage to get to this slide today, hence the part two. But\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of things that can go wrong, and this is a big list, and I got\nthat one from Chat GPT, to be honest, of all of the things that can go\nwrong with language. Feather and to be honest, also during my career, I\nsaw a lot of those and I had to deal with them and learn from all of that\nexperience. Now one way that we can protect service is with a tool like the\nOsmot Security core rule set and when I had a look under the hood, I\nactually didn\u0026rsquo;t find in mod security a specific rule set to parse the Http\nexcept language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 49:51\nSo I reached out to Dr. Christian on Twitter and he assured me that it\nfollows the standard rules applied for all of the headers. So there is\nprotection there. But the caveat is of course that WAFs are not application\ndependent, meaning that you would still be able to craft a particular\npacket, particular header in a particular way that will pass the web\napplication firewall and cause some damage on the server side and that\u0026rsquo;s\nit. Thank you for your attention. Actually managed to pass most of the\nthings. So I cut a lot of slides because I had more slides and I went to the\ndetail of specifying the differences in Http versions because now we are at\nversion three and there are things that are relevant, but I think that I can\ndo that in a different opportunity at another time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:46\nVery cool. I think it\u0026rsquo;s definitely one of the areas that is going to keep\nshowing up. And it\u0026rsquo;s a good example of something that especially the\nfingerprinting, I thought was really interesting. And you could see there\u0026rsquo;s\nso much data in there, so many independent points, that you can see how\nthat can then be used to actually fingerprint specifically the users right.\nAnd how it falls to the radar on some of the detections. How more and\nmore you have these anonymization services which I think is already cool.\nVery interesting to see how they handle that and how they proxy and they\nrewrite some of those headers to try to protect you but then if they don\u0026rsquo;t\nallow it, then you still are highly traceable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 51:39\nI got to tell you that there\u0026rsquo;s one extension that you can install in the\nbrowser that is really well known and apparently heavily used that doesn\u0026rsquo;t\ndo a good job and actually calls home. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to name it. And that\nwhen I actually came across the local overrides. I never thought of using it\nthat way. I actually thought, okay, this is something that is worth sharing\nalso because you can do exactly what you were talking about. So you can\nhave the security tool but you have to trust them or you can do it yourself.\nNow the caveat there is that if you\u0026rsquo;re going to do it yourself, it\u0026rsquo;s going to\nbe a lot of work and it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a lot easier for sure to do it for you.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s like if you\u0026rsquo;re a power user you can, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to delegate that\nand potentially have to trust, have to share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 52:21\nBut yeah, it was very interesting to me to also find that information, the\nchanges and the experiments that and I\u0026rsquo;ll mention it still. So Google, this\ntalk came because Google I found out that they were doing some work\nchanging that the way that this proactive negotiation happens and we\ncould make it even more efficient if I actually sent it only a header, right, a\nhead request. If I send a head request with my language preferences and I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t send anything else and I get the head response back, then that\nnegotiation can happen at that level. But I could also make it different. I\ncould send a head request and the server would tell me all the languages\nthat he has available. I lose no privacy and I select one of them. That can\nstill happen. The content language can come when I get all of the index\npage, but that index page can have 200 Http requests, like images, videos,\nwhatever, and that makes it inefficient, but the privacy of the user would\nbe retained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 53:21\nAnd I started asking myself, where does that not happen? And we have\ntools like Google Analytics that do a lot of tracking to improve the user\nexperience and so that you can improve your products as well online. And\nwhen you specify your language preferences, those get available in\nJavaScript. So if you go into the console and you type navigator\nlanguages, if I\u0026rsquo;m not mistaken, you will also get access to all the list of\nyour languages preferences. So that basically will go away. And it\u0026rsquo;s not all\nabout tracking, it\u0026rsquo;s not all about evil, it\u0026rsquo;s also about people being able to\nimprove the website stores to serve their customers better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:02\nBut we already have something that happens a little bit, because if you\nthink about it, you already have the special kind of security. You already\nhave the initial Get request that you can use to get a policy. You already\nhave the first options that actually can give you that. So there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of\nthings that there\u0026rsquo;s places where we can put that, and I agree, we will\nmake it because that actually goes with every request. And you might\nargue that maybe that\u0026rsquo;s not the best case. Cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 54:28\nCash up. That\u0026rsquo;s it exactly right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:31\nGood stuff. All right, thanks for doing the session. Let\u0026rsquo;s definitely do a\nvariation. I would like to see if we can explore it now to the idea of\nadaptive content, which I think is coming to the web where you start to\ndynamically create content and you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to start providing\nmore information about who the user is. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like we get to the\npoint where we\u0026rsquo;re going to start prompting sending prompts to the server\nto provide better information and that has another instant kind of worms\nthread modeling. That one brilliant, man. Thanks for this, Jeff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndré Ferreira - 55:04\nThanks for having me.\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2023/mini-summits/Jun/Governance/","event":"mini-summit","expirydate":-62135596800,"facebook":null,"fuzzywordcount":1e4,"hey_summit":"https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0kcumtrzIqGdGU901Tm6DPqcl7usquqWYi","image":null,"job_title":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752075784,"layout":"","linkedin":null,"notes":null,"objectID":"d7f9369a0ec1a8bc83167e81e4bad309","organizers":["André Ferreira"],"permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/governance/language-content-negotiation-where-its-where-its-going/","project":"Risk and Governance","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":47,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/governance/language-content-negotiation-where-its-where-its-going/","section":"sessions","status":null,"summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-this-session\"\u003eAbout this session\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLCN is a process of selecting the language and content that a web server will respond to a client\u0026rsquo;s request with.

Welcome to the last session in Open City Summit. April 2023. We\u0026rsquo;re\ngoing to end with a bang on actually a super massively important topic,\nwhich we\u0026rsquo;ve done a whole bunch of sessions before. I\u0026rsquo;m very glad that\nKieran and Subi are going to continue their thinking and give us some\nreally great case studies on really woman kickoff inside security, which I\u0026rsquo;m\na big defender and I really believe we need to get a lot more talent and a\nlot more women in cybersecurity. So over to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nYeah. Thank you, Denis. Today we are going to talk about women kick off\nin cybersecurity. Yes, before proceeding with the session, we would like to\ngive a quick introduction of ourselves. So, I\u0026rsquo;m Surbhi Gupta and I am a\ncybersecurity analyst with more than three years of experience in this\ntechnology. I have worked on technologies like SIM, security information\nand event management. I have worked on vulnerability assessment and\nendpoint protection. My skill set includes Splunk, Nessus, semantic. I\u0026rsquo;m\nalso a Zero certified Cloud engineer. I am currently a cybersecurity\nlearner at Cybersecurity Academy program in OSI, Norway. Now I will\nhand over to Kieran to introduce herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nYeah, I am Kieran. I have done Masters in Technology back india and I\nhave five years experience in teaching. Now presently I am going on\ntraining period in Telenor and where I am working with cloud\ntechnologies. After that, during this period, I have done some\ncertifications, like cloud certifications. Now I am a cybersecurity learner\nat the Innoscience Academy. I will start now to the session. Main aim of\nthe today session is what is the cybersecurity challenges faced by women\nin cybersecurity, domains in cybersecurity, career roles and pathway in\ncybersecurity. So let\u0026rsquo;s discuss first what is cybersecurity? Actually, we have\nmade this presentation in simplest form. Who are new to cybersecurity, it\nis easy for them to understand what is it basically?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nCybersecurity is basically the protecting for protecting computer system\nnetworks and digital information from unauthorized access, theft and\ndamage. In other words, you can say that cybersecurity is all about\nensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of digital\ninformation by mitigating the risk and threats posed by cybercriminals.\nSo, who are new for them? What is confidentiality? So, CIA trade is the\nmodel that organization used to evaluate the security capabilities and risk.\nSo CIA is confidentiality, integrity and availability. So first discuss the\nconfidentiality. Confidentiality is the protecting information to make sure\nonly those people who are allowed to use the information are allowed to\nuse it. By enabling the access Control policy, encrypt data, use multibit\nauthentication, we can maintain the confidentiality. Next is integrity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nIntegrity means that data or information in your system is maintained so\nthat it is not modified deleted by unauthorized parties. For example, if\nyour company provides information about Senior Manager on your\nwebsite, and some information need to have integrity if it is inaccurate,\nthen those who visiting the website for information may feel your\norganization is not trustworthy. So how can we protect the integrity? By\nusing hashing, encryption and digital certificates we can maintain the\nintegrity. And third one is availability. The final component of CIA trade is\navailability. It means that the system and the data available to individuals\nwhen they need it under any circumstances including power outages and\nnatural disasters. Without availability, if you have met the other two\ncomponents of CIA trade, your business can never be negatively impacted\ncan be negatively impacted to ensure the availability, your organization\ncan use redundant network servers and application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nWe can say that an information security system that is lacking in one of\nthese three aspects of CIA trade is insufficient. Next is women\u0026rsquo;s in\ncybersecurity according to various studies and reports in the modern\nworld also women continue to underrepresented in the field of\ncybersecurity. Women in cybersecurity earn less than man. According to\nreports in the United States, the gender pay gap is cybersecurity 18% so it\nis higher than the average pay gap across all the industries. According to\nCybersecurity Ventures magazines, women make up only 24% of the\ncybersecurity workflow globally. According to Cybercrime Magazine\nsurvey prediction, women will represent 30% of the global cybersecurity\nworkflow by 2025 and that will reach 35% by 2031. These statics highlight\nthe need for the industry to prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion efforts\nin order to address the underrepresentation of women in cybersecurity and\ncreate a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all the\nprofessionals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nNext is challenges there are many challenges that women face sorry, some\nof them are lack of representation. Women are underrepresented in the\nleadership position in cybersecurity which can make it difficult for them to\nfind role models and mentors. Next isolation women in cybersecurity may\nfeel isolated particularly if they are only women on a team or in the\ndepartment so that may make it difficult for build relationship with the\ncolleagues. Third is hostile work environment women may experience\nhostile work environment in which they are subjected to harassment,\nbullying and even threats. This can lead to high level of stress and anxiety\nthat may ultimately drive a moment out of the field. And next is gender\nbias. The woman in the cybersecurity open face gender bias which can\nmanifest in many forms including unequal pay, lack of promotion,\nopportunity and discrimination in hiring. Next is stereotype. The woman in\ncybersecurity may be subjected to negative stereotypes such as being seen\nas less technical or competent than their male counterparts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nThis can lead to a lack of recognition for their skills and contributions.\nNext is work life balance you can say that women in cybersecurity may\nface challenges in achieving work life balance, particularly if they have a\ncaregiving responsibilities. This can make it difficult to take on demanding\nroles and pursue advanced training and education. It is important for the\nindustry to address these challenges and create a more inclusive and\nwelcoming environment for the women in the cybersecurity. This can\ninclude initiative to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, as well as\nproviding mentorship, training and networking opportunities for the\nwoman in the field. Next, is why women choose cybersecurity. As the static\nsay that there are very less moments in cybersecurity if we compared to\nmen. There are many reasons that should motivate a woman to choose\nthis cybersecurity path. So in which first is growing demand. The demand\nfor cybersecurity professionals increasing rapidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nWith the rise of cyber attacks and cyber threats and the increasing\nimportance of protecting digital assets, this means that there are plenty of\njob opportunities in the field. Next is job security. Security is a rapidly\ngrowing industry and there is a high demand for skilled professionals. This\nmeans that job in the field tend to be relatively secure and stable. Third is\ngood pay. Cybersecurity professionals tend to earn competitive salaries\nand pay can be quite well paid. According to report, average cybersecurity\nsalary in the US is around dollar 90,000 to dollar 103,000 per year. This is\nmore than the double the national median earning of workers across all\nthe industries. Next is intellectual change. Cybersecurity is complex and\nconstantly involving fields, which means that it can be intellectually\nchallenging and stimulating. There is always something new to learn and\nthe work can be highly rewarded. Next is opportunity for the impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nCybersecurity professionals play a crucial role in the protecting\norganization, government and individual from cyber threat. This means\nthat the work is meaningful and has a real impact on the world. Next is\nopportunities for the growth. Cybersecurity is a field that is constantly\nevolving, which means that there are plenty of opportunities for growth\nand advancement. This can include taking on leadership role, pursuing\nadvanced training or education, and branching out into the late fields.\nNext is diversity of roles. Cybersecurity is a field that encompasses on a\nwide range of roles and responsibility, from technical positions such as\npenetration tester and security analysts, to nontechnical roles such as\npolicy analysts and compliance specialists. This means that there is\nsomething for everyone, regardless of their background or skill set. Now,\nSurbhi will take you further. Over to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nBe thank you, Kiran. Now as we know that to protect cybersecurity, we\nneed to know about the confidentiality, integrity and availability trend. I\nstarted learning cybersecurity, what I had in mind was like a figure, a\nperson who is sitting in a dark room and as you used writing some codes\nand trying to intrude the organization network. I thought that a job of a\ncybersecurity professional was to stop that person from intruding a\nparticular network. Okay, then I thought, okay, I should be an ethical\nhacker, I should start learning coding and I should start learning how to\nexploit vulnerabilities in an organization and how I can fix them so I\nthought that this is one of the most important role for one person can take\nin cybersecurity. There are many roles like from protecting an\norganization from a cyber attack to the procedure what happens after a\ncyber attack has taken place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nI would be covering some of the domains which are in cybersecurity. First\nis the network security. The network security basically deals with the\nimplementation of procedures and technologies which are used to protect\nyour network against intrusion, unauthorized excess or modification or\ndestruction of your network resources and also protection of your data\nwhich is being transmitted from one network to a different other network.\nWhat are the implementations that we can do? Like using a firewall which\ncan filter the incoming and outgoing traffic using intrusion detection\nsystem or intrusion prevention system which can identify and block\nmalicious traffic. We can use virtual private network so we can also use\nnetwork segmentation to segment the networks so that if an attack takes\nplace in one network, it does not spread to the other networks. This is\nbasically what is done in network security. Incident Response in foreign\nsix, the name itself is that when there is a security incident for suppose\nthere is a data breach or there is a malware incident, how should we\nrespond to that security incident?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nThis is what is covered incident response. And forensics? Forensics is\nbasically once the data attack has been the attack has been happened,\nwhat evidences do we have? How do we collect those evidences? How do\nwe preserve those evidences? What analysis can we do on those evidences?\nHow can we gather our analysis in a particular report and present it to the\norganization? What security recommendations can we implement so that\nthis attack doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen in the future? Or we can protect our\norganization at the maximum limit? The third domain I would like to talk\nabout is governance, risk and compliance which basically deals with the\nmanagement and the rules and procedures which an organization follows\nin decision making or in daily operations. At the same time being\ncompliant with industry and industry standards, rules and regulations like\nISO and PCI DSS for example, cloud Security what is cloud security?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nMostly in earlier time the infrastructure was always on premise. Now the\ninfrastructure is either shared or is entirely on cloud. Our resources, our\napplication, our user accounts, everything is on cloud. So how can we\nprotect them? All about cloud security, for example, like implementing\nmultifactor authentication maybe. How can we protect our resources in\ncloud deals with cloud security like us, pass us the cloud services.\nEverything is covered in cloud security. Identity and access Management\nas the name itself says that we are managing the identities from the\nidentification to management to the deletion of identity, the user roles, the\ngroups, the devices, everything. That is identity and access management,\nauthorization, authentication, auditing, reporting everything is covered in\nidentity and access management. Application Security application Security\nis basically protecting our application from the security threats and\nvulnerabilities by running scans on our application, identifying the\nvulnerabilities and fixing them, also protecting them against attacks like\ncross site scripting, SQL Injection so these are some of the domains which\nI wanted to talk about in cybersecurity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nNow we can discuss about the roles in cybersecurity. Career Roles in\nCybersecurity so now we have a fair idea about what actually happens in\ncybersecurity. What are the different domains so we can talk about\ncompliance Auditor these are some of the career roles because there are\nvarious career roles in cybersecurity. I would like to cover some like\ncompliance. Auditor what does a compliance auditor do? Anyone who\nloves to follow rules and who wants that the organization should be\ncompliant with all the rules and regulations should opt for this role, which\nis compliance Auditor. The function of Compliance Auditor is to run\naudits, to check if the resources are non compliant, which field is non\ncompliant, and to provide recommendation. Security Analyst so I started\nmy journey as a Sock analyst and my function was to analyze the logs and\ngather information, data analysis and mitigate the risk to any extent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nOkay, so that would be security Analyst penetration Tester works like you\ncan connect ethical Hacker and Penetration Tester. It exploits\nvulnerabilities which are in organization networks and resources and then\nreports those vulnerabilities to the organization and suggest the\nrecommendation. That how we can fix them. Incident Responder as the\nname says it responds to the security Incident. Basically, they define a\nstrategy that if a security incident takes place in the organization, how\ncan we respond it and what will be the roles and responsibility of the\nteam? Security Concern security Concern basically, if you have expertise\nenough to guide your team in case of a security incident and to give\nsecurity awareness trainings to everyone in the organization, you should\ngo for Security Consultant. Security Architect now, this role requires a\nlarge amount of expertise in network architecture, system design, and this\nis a person who basically knows how to design and implement security\nsolutions in the organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nNow we have a fair idea about the career roles in cybersecurity along with\nethical hacker. Let\u0026rsquo;s move to the next pathway. So, as I said in the\nbeginning, we will be sharing a very simple pathway for a person who is\nbeginner in the cybersecurity. Now, the very first thing what you should do\nis to learn the It fundamentals. You should know what you are protecting.\nWhat is a computer, what is a hardware, what is networking, what is an IP\naddress? Then what is like yes, basic knowledge. What is the OS? Right?\nWhat kind of languages are being used in a web application, how does an\napplication work? That is all covered in It fundamentals and there are\nvarious platforms which provide training on these It fundamentals like\nGoogle itself provides a certification program then we have Code\nAcademy, we have Coursera, we have W three schools which is entirely for\nlearning different code languages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nAfter you have learned the it fundamentals, even the basic you can\nproceed to basics of cybersecurity. Meaning? You should know what is\ncybersecurity? What is a ransomware? What is a malware? What is a\nTrojan? What is cryptography? What is encryption? What is\nauthentication? What is authorization? Basics of cybersecurity so that you\ncan implement them in the future. There are various platforms where you\nlearn them some of being the common like Coursera. Now I also know\nabout Tech Target which writes about these topics in a very simple\nmanner. You can also refer to YouTube, you can refer to LinkedIn where\nthese trainings are provided. The third step according to me should be\ngain practical experience. Why I haven\u0026rsquo;t mentioned certification before?\nPractical experience because it is very important to have en hands on\nexperience to understand what you studied well should connect to you the\nterms in mind like we can achieve that through Capture the Flag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nIf you guys have heard about the capture, the flag is basically a\ncybersecurity competition where the individuals compete in team, are\nsingle handed, and there are certain vulnerabilities which the organizers\nplan, and we need to exploit them in order to gain a flag. That flag is in\nthe form of code. When we submit that code to the organization, then we\nget some points and we win. It is basically like a gaming experience. There\nis also a platform like Try Hack me I have used it and personally I would\nsay it is very good because it covers all the knowledge from Basic to\nAdvanced. They have virtual machines where you can practice they also\nhave certain rooms where they mention information about certain skills\nand then they test you on that so you gain practical experience on it and\nthen there\u0026rsquo;s also Hack the Box. After having certain practical experience\nyou can also go for internships and you can also try going for this\ninternships with various organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nSemantic offers such internship and there are many more IBM offers also\nthe internship. After having a certain amount of practical experience you\ncan decide your cyber security career to which role suits you the most and\nmaybe after gaining some practical experience you can go for certain\ncertifications like Comfy Security plus and then you would have a fair idea\nwhich domain of cybersecurity interests you more. You can choose a\ncybersecurity according to your interest. This was a simple pathway from\nour side. In the next slide we would like to share some resources like some\nonline learning assets like I mentioned earlier, code Academy, Coursera, W\nthree schools I think YouTube is the best source but there is I would say a\nlittle demerit with YouTube because it is a vast platform. It is a platform\nwith a large number of videos and you might get confused for which video\nyou should follow, which video should not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nI think you should be specific in what you want to learn. Then, as I\nmentioned, Tech Target because as a beginner in cybersecurity I usually\nused to read the articles from Tech Target to understand what technology\nis, what does it mean, what resource it is. I would highly recommend\nTechtarget.com then LinkedIn. We have so many free learnings in\nLinkedIn related to any field. So you should try LinkedIn also. My\nsuggestion is, like, you should subscribe to Cybersecurity News. Like the\nHacker News Security Week. Cyberscope? It is very important to remain\nupdated in cybersecurity about maybe the vulnerabilities which are being\ndiscovered or maybe the attacks, or maybe the new security technologies\nwhich are coming in place. Yeah, I would recommend these learning\nassets. Let\u0026rsquo;s move to the next slide. Quick Tips as we discussed earlier,\nlearn fundamentals. You should be very clear with your fundamentals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nYou should get certified. Now, whenever I sit for looking for a job, I\nusually see there are so many job postings which require certain\ncertifications. Most common I see is like CISSP. CISSP requires five years\nof cybersecurity experience before going for it. I think for a beginner level\nyou should start with Conscious Security Plus. And then you should\nadvance further. If you want to go for Ethical Hacking, you should go for\nCertified Ethical Hacker or Junior Pen Tester. First you should know what\nfield you want to go in. Then again, gain practical experience. Stay up to\ndate. You should stay up to date. I mean, you should know what\ntechnology is recent, then develop soft skills. Having technical knowledge\nis important, but if you are not able to convey it, then it\u0026rsquo;s not so useful\nbecause you are working in cybersecurity but your vendors, your\norganization, it is not necessary that everyone is aware of the technical\njargons you might be using.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nYou should know how to convey your message in simple language. And\nalso I would also say networking. Grow your network as much as you can.\nCommunicate with people. Join cybersecurity groups online, on LinkedIn,\non various other platforms, on Facebook so that you can connect with\nother people, you can learn from them. So, these were some quick tips\nfrom my side and now I would like to talk about Inocai. Me and Karen are\nfrom Innoci School of Programming. Innoci offers learning courses and\nworks with a motive of reducing the technical skill gap and inclusion\ndiversity. Since the course at Inocai are intense, they also offer mentor\nsessions, mental mentor sessions and weekly mentor sessions. Like they\nare very effective because mentors from different organization come and\nguide us through their career journey and we are able to learn so much\nfrom them. At Innocera we go through effective learning programs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nThere are also programs, real time real world programs which are set by\nindustry experts. Now they make us ready with the skills so that we are up\nto date when we join a certain job. So I would like to thank NSI for this\nopportunity. My journey at NSI. If I talk about it I came to know about\nNSI from LinkedIn and personally if I speak I have worked on premises\nand I wanted to learn cloud technology and also I was so enthusiastic to\nknow how cybersecurity is helping and protecting resources on cloud. I\nlooked up at NSI and there I got a program which had both the things\nwhere I could learn both the things the cloud computing as well as how\ncybersecurity is helping secure the resources in cloud computing. It was a\nboom for me and I had to go for it and frankly speaking this was a very\ngood experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nThis is actually a very good experience for me because the course is\nintense but the course is designed in such a way that you learn very\nefficiently. You are at pace and mentor sessions that I spoke about earlier.\nWe get a lot of guidance. My networking has also improved after joining\ninocyte so I would highly recommend you guys also if you are thinking of\nbeing a career in It, go for it. And Kiran, would you like to share your\nexperience with Innocence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nYes, thank you. Actually I also want to share my experience how I started\nmy journey with Enoscience. As I have discussed in the starting of the\npresentation I have five years of teaching experience so I do not have any\nIt experience. Last year I have started internship at Telenoras Cloud\nEngineer where I have learned a lot about cloud technology. During this\ntime I have attended many seminars where I came to know about\ncybersecurity. I am a person who always try my hands in learning new\nthings and I challenge myself to learn more about cybersecurity.\nInoscience came to my life and which was entirely a game changer for me.\nWhich combined my both cloud experience and my cybersecurity\nlearnings. Today I am with a quite a good exposure in cybersecurity. This\nis my experience how I have started my journey with Inoscience. If you\nwant to tie your hands with learning something new and wants to make a\ncareer in cybersecurity then come and join us at Inoscience and be a part\nof cybersecurity society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nFor any question regarding innoscience please contact and follow and\ngiven information. You can also follow Serbia and me on the LinkedIn. If\nyou have any further curious regarding how to start career and in\ncybersecurity we are happy to help you. Thank you. We are also open to\nany questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nYeah I have a couple really cool. I really like the way you\u0026rsquo;re explaining the\ndifferent paths and the different ways to get into cybersecurity, which is\nreally cool. Do you have any thoughts about people with quite a lot of\nexperience? I think we talked before we started. I think a big source of\ntalent, of course, is the new generation, right? It\u0026rsquo;s making them excited\nabout it, saying it\u0026rsquo;s a great career, right. I would say for anybody that\u0026rsquo;s\nnew joining, you should still reassure that you have individuals on the\nolder side. I would put myself on that side now that we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this\nfor 30 years, but we\u0026rsquo;re still super passionate. We love it and it\u0026rsquo;s a great\ncareer, right? And there\u0026rsquo;s some amazing problems to solve. I think that\npath is in, but I feel that in the kind of diversity side of things, I feel that\nwe\u0026rsquo;re missing a little trick by not finding good ways to bring talent that is\nquite experienced and for example, is really great at engineering, really\ngreat at medicine, really great at other very complex careers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nSomebody with a PhD really knows how to process data, right? Somebody\nthat works on any or works for managing a lot of people in certain\nsituations. They know a lot about the core, almost. They have a lot of the\ncore skills that we need in cybersecurity, but they might not have\ncybersecurity experience. What\u0026rsquo;s your thoughts on how do we can help\nthem to come into kind of our world where although they don\u0026rsquo;t have a\ncouple of little things that they need to learn, almost the hard capabilities\nthat we all want to hire for, they already have?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nSo Karen, should I answer this? Okay, so as Denis, you said that there are\npeople who have skills and they are highly qualified in them, but they do\nnot know cybersecurity so much. I personally think that we should give\neveryone a chance if you think that they have that potential, that they will\nbe able to combat any type of attack with the skills that they have learned\nfrom their past profession. What we can do from myself, if I say from the\noutsider, we can specify certain basic skills, just as I said, for a beginner to\nhave certain basic certifications. Right? Because I think that if they are so\nmuch qualified in the profession that they are doing, I think experience is\nmore important than skills. If they are able to learn a skill which is quite\ngood in their profession, I personally believe that they will be able to pop\nup quickly in this profession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nThe only thing required is the support from our side. And the clarity. The\nclarity that what exactly do we expect from us? Do we require a certain\nbasic level of expectation certification, right, or do we require we are\nactually judging them on the basis of their knowledge, like providing\ntrainings. I think for me, the solution would be like to provide them\ntrainings and then for a certain period of time and then invite them for an\ninterview like we do with our employees in the organization. I personally\nfeel like this because giving them not a chance. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is going\nto solve the problem just because we have the fear that they won\u0026rsquo;t be able\nto whether they will be able to do it or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nWhen you say we provide them trainings but there\u0026rsquo;s lots of training online\nalready, right? There\u0026rsquo;s lots of really good open source training stuff. If you\nwant to learn how to hack, there\u0026rsquo;s online platforms even for free, right.\nYou can set up juice shop, you can fire up a bunch of things, right, so you\nmean those to see almost like hey, if you can find, try that and if you really\nlike it, then we just want to see the delta where they were and now and see\ntheir excitement about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nYes. Because if they are passionate about entering them, suppose if there\nis a job for an ethical hacker in your organization and you are searching\nfor someone who has at least a hand on experience on CTF, I think you\nshould interview that guy. Right. To have that knowledge. Or you can\nprovide them with a specification just like before interviewing. You can\ncome up with these courses, just prepare these courses and then you are\neligible to sit for an interview so they will have a clean perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nYeah, which is interesting. We kind of talk about it. It\u0026rsquo;s almost you\u0026rsquo;re\nsaying we can even create a curriculum for non security experts and\nsaying look, here\u0026rsquo;s the kind of path if you think about that curriculum\nshould be the same one that they follow internally, right. We should say,\nlook, if you\u0026rsquo;re going into the cybersecurity, this is the path we would like\nyou or recommend you to take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nHere are the actions and hear the things, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nActually to be like maybe we should do an open security summit project\naround it because I need it. I think there isn\u0026rsquo;t a good path out there.\nIdeally in this session you could actually turn that path. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like you\ngot some good pointers. I think we can be a bit more explicit on go here,\nstart here, do this. I like the idea that\u0026rsquo;s the path that we would promote\nboth with the people that we hired or the people that we want to hire\nbecause at least it\u0026rsquo;s fair. Also we allow that talent to be proactive and to\nsay look, I started here but I\u0026rsquo;m already here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nYeah, okay, we\u0026rsquo;ll have that in mind to add here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nI totally agree with Surbhi, but I have another way also. Like if we can\ncall for a person for a journal interview and let them know what we are\nactually looking for and on what projects we are working, what\ntechnology they are looking for and give them. Some deadline, like for one\nmonth and something according to your requirement and give them a\nchance at least so they can go back and learn about something. After a\nmonth you can have a session again and according to that, you can find\nout that how a person is eager to learn and what can the person can learn.\nThis could also solve a problem of unemployed person, like directly say,\nno, you are not matching with our requirements because we are also\nlooking for a job. I think if this thing is happening, the companies maybe it\nwill solve the problem of unemployment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nYeah, cool. No, I like it. I was just checking the chat. I don\u0026rsquo;t think we have\nbilly, you want to ask a question? Sorry, let me make you co host. Give me\na second and.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nSorry, I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nThink that\u0026rsquo;s the other question. I\u0026rsquo;m just sorry, I\u0026rsquo;m just making him a co\nhost because I don\u0026rsquo;t think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nI there is one person. Hanson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nYeah, I just need to log in quickly as the host. Okay, sorry, you can share\nnow. Go ahead. Actually, sorry. Now you can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nHi Billy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly:\nYeah, first, I really love what Kiran was saying there about having a list of\nthings companies want to see in a prospective employee or like a new hire.\nAlso what Dennis was saying about having a criteria or a curriculum, I\nwould really love to see a curriculum of different skills for the different\ntypes of roles because I\u0026rsquo;m also just learning about cybersecurity, but I\u0026rsquo;m\njust kind of going with what I can see at the moment. Starting on Try\nHack Me, I just started learning about learning Python, just different\nthings like that. I would really love to have a direction and that\u0026rsquo;s\nsomething that I would really love to see in the future, either from\nprospective employers that are looking to hire in the security field or even\njust from the industry professionals. Just to show if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for this\ntype of a career in cybersecurity, you should focus on these right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly:\nThat way I think that would really help a lot of people just getting the ball\nrolling on their training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nYeah, Billy, I totally agree because I think that applying for jobs from\nbeing an outsider and I have worked with in cybersecurity. My past\nexperience is that learning is fine, reading theory is fine, but until unless\nyou have an hands on experience, that is not going to help. I should say\nthankfully that there are options right now which we can explore, which\nprovide us hands on experience. Like try hack me to take that for an\nexample. Now it has various courses from beginners to advanced level,\nright. I could literally follow the instructions and exploit a particular\nvulnerability to get that flag. I was eager to earn that flag and from in\nthat process I could learn about that vulnerability. I personally think that it\nis very important that the employers understand this point to give chance\nto the people who are eager to join cybersecurity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nBecause when I go for a job search and I see that in an entry level, it\nrequires three years of experience. Four years of experience, five years of\nexperience. Right. So even I am not very clear. Why is this experience\nrequired? Because I join as with a zero level, zero experience, right. I learn\neverything on the ground in the organization. I would learn much faster in\nthat way. I think everybody can learn much faster if they are given a\nchance. Basically, what Kevin said, even I agree with that. My thinking is\nthat there should be specifically clarity what is exactly expected from us?\nHow should we proceed? Yeah, absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nThe main is to give a chance first and let employees explore. Maybe it will,\nbecause it works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nI had a lot of success, right, of bringing people that didn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of\nexperience in cybersecurity. What they had was the passion. Right. The\nchallenge, I find, is how to do that in a fair way, doing the job interview\nprocess, right. There\u0026rsquo;s a school of thought that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be giving a\nlot of homework or a lot of tasks to the candidates. My thinking is actually\nthe more tasks we do and there\u0026rsquo;s a little difference between tasks and paid\nwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nRight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nI\u0026rsquo;m not saying we should give them unpaid work, but I think that the more\ntasks and the more paths we can give to the candidates, the more we can\ndistinguish between the ones that really want to do it and the ones that\nthink it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea. Because actually we now have an interesting curse\nwhere because the salary margin is so good now in cybersecurity, the\npremium is so good there\u0026rsquo;s, people say, oh, cool, I\u0026rsquo;ll go into that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nRight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nI think almost I would argue that\u0026rsquo;s not who we want. Who we want is the\npeople that want to do that because they have a passion. They found a\nplace that it\u0026rsquo;s really interesting. There\u0026rsquo;s something in cybersecurity and\nthe world is so big. In cybersecurity, you can always find an area. You can\ngo from compliance to testing, to planning, to architecture, development,\nengineering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nFinding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nProblems, fixing problems like literature, you name it, right? What we\nneed to do is find something that you\u0026rsquo;re very passionate about and also\nhave the confidence that you will add a lot of value by just having\nexperiences that most people in our industry don\u0026rsquo;t have. That\u0026rsquo;s why we\nneed the diversity of thinking. We need diversity of thoughts. That comes\nfrom individuals that have different experience, they have different life\nexperience, have different thinkings. Right? A mom actually has the type\nof experiences that others don\u0026rsquo;t have. Hiring moms that have raised kids,\nmaybe now they pass the age where the kids don\u0026rsquo;t kill themselves if you\ndon\u0026rsquo;t keep an eye on them every day, right? Then they are amazing talent,\nright. They haven\u0026rsquo;t worked for five years, for example, or they haven\u0026rsquo;t\nworked in the industry. So how do we get them in? Some of it is actually\nimpostor syndrome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nYou haven\u0026rsquo;t really talked a lot of it, but I have also seen a lot of impostor\nsyndrome, which is very frustrating because I believe in the individuals. I\njust want the individuals to believe more in themselves. Right. To know\nthat you might not have the exact technical skills, but the skills that you\nhave, the common sense and the experience is what we really need\nindustry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nYeah, I agree with you, Denis. The thing is, I think the only way is giving\nthem a chance through internships, maybe, and proving themselves. I\nthink this is the best goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nYeah, but internships are tough when for somebody more senior, right?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say somebody works as a doctor on an emergency hospital, right? An\nE, right? That person knows how to deal with pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nCorrect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nTalk about somebody who knows how to deal with crazy situations.\nEverything is flying around. What do you focus that\u0026rsquo;s who you want as an\ninstant responder, right? Like, that person will be amazing in\ncybersecurity, right? You can\u0026rsquo;t give them an intern job, right? Because that\nperson might be quite senior ready. I think there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of talent that fits\ninto it. Talent that could be great at cybersecurity, especially in the mid to\nsenior roles. That kind of we need to find a way to give them simpler roles\nwithout having seniority, that they can use their skills, but then give them\nthe time to basically be able to hold their own in cybersecurity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nOkay, so if I say in this way, like taking your example, a doctor who is\ndoing an operation or delivery and he wants to become a part of\ncybersecurity, but you are saying that he is much experienced to give an\ninternship, right? Still, he\u0026rsquo;s a beginner in cybersecurity, right? You are a\nbeginner in any industry, you start from zero. I think that having a basic\nknowledge is very important. When you are starting, because in\ncybersecurity, it is very important that you learn the fundamentals. If he\nwants to enter himself into cybersecurity, he\u0026rsquo;s very well aware of the fact\nthat he will be starting from beginner level. He is a beginner. Right. I don\u0026rsquo;t\nthink according to me, there might not be a problem. But if you are trying\nto we.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nCan say that it depends on your priority. Like if you can choose a salary\npackage or you can choose your opportunity. If you go with the like, I\u0026rsquo;m a\nfive year experience, I can\u0026rsquo;t take an entry level position. It means you are\nnot eager to learn new things. It means you are more focused on surgery.\nSo I think. So you have to prioritize your things. What is more important\nfor your experience or you want to learn something new? I think it is a\npersonal level who can think in what way. Like if I talk about myself, I\nhave five years teaching experience. Now I move to it and I\u0026rsquo;m totally new\nto this, it background and all. If I expect I have five experience, I can\u0026rsquo;t do\nentry level job, then I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can ever go into the It and get a job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nSo it depends upon me how I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nTake this, how you approach certain specifications. Because ultimately\nyou are a beginner, you enter into any field or if I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nSay I am an engineer, I want to doctor. I even don\u0026rsquo;t know how to do\nstitches for that I have also go to entry level for every area or every\nindustry. If you are new, you have to start from zero and it is nothing\nwrong in that, I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nYeah, I get that but I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nThat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nI feel that\u0026rsquo;s the bit that I don\u0026rsquo;t think we have good examples or good paths\nlike you said, right? Because I feel that\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s available today. But that\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t work in practice. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t work in practice for somebody who\nalready have a career responsibilities basically, right? If you\u0026rsquo;re just out of\nuniversity, right, you can afford to do an internship, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nBecause probably or another way we can do in this way like we don\u0026rsquo;t left\nour job first and side by we are giving extra time to learn more technology.\nYou think that you are capable of that then you should move to next job\nand asking for like I have this experience so I should go for this. So this is\nanother way we can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nSay, and I think most of the people do like this only, right? They continue\nlearning new skills with the job they are already doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nWe\u0026rsquo;re saying that maybe we should have these part time openings to give\npeople the ability to do it part time in extra bits, so they can learn, get the\nexperience, have real world experience in these activities and then do the\nmove. That could be an interesting offering, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nIf we can, because we all know that every profession requires certain\namount of dedication and cybersecurity requires continuous learning,\nright? It\u0026rsquo;s like one needs to be very sure that he or she has to be a part of\ncybersecurity and for that, according to me, they should have some\nexperience to decide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nLike that phrase you said cybersecurity does require dedication, right?\nMaybe that\u0026rsquo;s what we should be already pushing early on to say look, if\nyou don\u0026rsquo;t have dedication to jump these initial hoops, right, then it\u0026rsquo;s not\ngoing to work for you because this is just the beginning of that path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s high time for the industry to address these challenges and\ncreate a more inclusive and welcoming environment for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nThe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly:\nI was just thinking for technical roles we have ways of testing that such as\ntry hack me, pack the box, things like that, GitHub if you\u0026rsquo;re a coder, that\nkind of stuff. What if people who are looking to hire people for entry level\ncybersecurity roles in a more technical field, what if they set up their own\na mini try hack me thing, for people that are just looking to so that way\nthey could have it so that you could log into a virtual machine, try to hack\nit, or do whatever their assignment is. If you\u0026rsquo;re for coding, maybe they\ncould ask you to supply a script that would do a specific function,\nsomething like that, just for various technical things that they\u0026rsquo;re looking\nfor. Maybe set up docker containers or something on Amazon web services\nin like a virtual environment kind of a thing, just so they can see that\npeople have those abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly:\nOnce if someone can complete those abilities, at least to some degree, then\nthat would allow that company or that company would then allow that\nperson to submit a resume or they could get their information to further\nspeak to them about a potential role. I think a lot of them they\u0026rsquo;re asking\nfor resumes and from my understanding, most of the time they don\u0026rsquo;t even\nlook at most of the resumes, just toss them aside and that\u0026rsquo;s someone\u0026rsquo;s\nchance right there just getting thrown out. This way as well, if they do it\nlike this, they could make it anonymous so that they don\u0026rsquo;t know who is\ncompleting all the challenges, they just know that they\u0026rsquo;ve done them and\nthat way it removes any bias from the decision right off the get go. I think\nthat would really help with getting them a diverse set of applicants right\nthen and there just because it\u0026rsquo;s strictly by what they can do, what they can\nprove that they can do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nYeah, I completely agree with you. Like you said that you\u0026rsquo;re applying two\njobs and we are not sure whether our resume are properly looked upon or\nnot. I completely agree with you and we are actually focusing on just\ngiving a chance because somebody who is an expert in this industry at\nonce was given a chance, right? Someone has to start from somewhere for\nstarting somewhere we want that chance. I\u0026rsquo;m saying like that because you\ncan\u0026rsquo;t become an expert until and unless you gain experience on a\nparticular thing and there are many things which you learn while you are\nin an organization in real time. Okay, so my appeal is only that, yes, we\ncan go through a curriculum, we can go through creating virtual\nmachines. That organization give us this chance of solving particular like\ncapture the flag or something like that. But we should be given chance for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nAn entry level job. They are asking for some hands on cloud technology\nthree years experience for entry level job. How can they expect hands on\nnow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nI think they will be able to answer this question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nWell, look, I think that if somebody is asking for that, then it\u0026rsquo;s already not\nthe right employee. I put job specs in the past where we literally would\nhave in the job spec saying you don\u0026rsquo;t need service experience for this job,\nright? Like apply. And we had some great candidates, right? I think it\u0026rsquo;s\nalso on the employees, right. I think if the employee is open to hire people\nwithout cybersecurity experience because they\u0026rsquo;re going after a certain\ntype of talent, then they need to be explicit. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s the key.\nRight? It\u0026rsquo;s a bit like if somebody says you need to have three years\nexperience with chat GBT, right? You already know they\u0026rsquo;re clueless. Right.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the same thing. Right. But you have that, right? You always have these\njobs where they want to I remember there was Net, you need to have five\nyears experience in Net.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nWe\u0026rsquo;re like, dude.net, was released two years ago, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nYou always have this. I think it\u0026rsquo;s up to the employee to basically put good\nJDS out there because, look, it\u0026rsquo;s a privilege, right. We want companies\nthat view the talent that they\u0026rsquo;re hiring as talent, not as numbers or as\nquantity. Right? You want to find companies who think like that. The good\nnews is that the cybersecurity market at the moment is so hot that it\u0026rsquo;s\nprobably the easiest time to get into the industry, right, because you can\nliterally hack your way into it. You can literally deliver on the job, right,\nbecause there\u0026rsquo;s such a demand. The good news is the pay is good, right.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not even like you have to go in a massive desert before you even get\nthis amount of money, right? There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of great talent, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of\nskill shortage. I kind of agree when you were saying that the people that\nwant to do the job need to show a level of productivity, need to show a\nlevel of putting some skin in the game, right, to show that they are\ncommitted to do the jump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nAnd even one, please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nI just wanted to being clear, because I\u0026rsquo;m not the employer, I wanted to\nknow how an employer thinks about it. Now, in a cybersecurity company,\nwhen you are hiring, right, you already have some experts who an existing\nSock team or existing vulnerability assessment team who is already doing\ntheir work, right? If you hire a person who has basic knowledge or who\nhas little bit experience, meanwhile the existing team is handling the\noperations, that person can learn. Right. What is the fare in hiring a\nperson who has, I mean, basic level of experience? I just want to\nunderstand this point because there\u0026rsquo;s already a cybersecurity team which\nis doing their job. Maybe the beginner level can be given a chance to learn\nfrom them, because I learned in that way. I wanted to ask, what is the\ncurrent scenario?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nBut why do they do charity? Why they hire internship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nI\u0026rsquo;m talking about internships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nInternship, you can say, but for a job, I think nobody can do no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nI\u0026rsquo;m talking about internships. Can we do this in this manner?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nWell, you can. To be honest, if you have internships and early entry jobs,\nand if somebody applies with that, which clearly has crazy experience\nright. I would argue that person has a big competitive advantage. Right.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a bit like you\u0026rsquo;re already hiring people that don\u0026rsquo;t have clear experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nWhy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an internship or a junior role. If somebody appears in there that says,\nI\u0026rsquo;ve run teams of 2030 people. I know how to work here, I\u0026rsquo;m an architect,\nI know how to build a house, I\u0026rsquo;m a lawyer, I have a PhD or I have a degree\non psychology. Right. All those things are insane assets. Right. I don\u0026rsquo;t\nthink that\u0026rsquo;s the gap that we have. Right. That market already kind of\nexists, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s enough people joining the market because\nthe ones we need to attract, especially on a diverse and women more\nspecifically. Right. We don\u0026rsquo;t have a good funnel. If you look at the number\nof kids in schools, you still have 90% males in computing course. Right.\nYou still have cybersecurity courses. It\u0026rsquo;s still very male dominated, so it\u0026rsquo;s\nalready skewed from the start. The reality is that I think we need to be\nfinding talents that already has graduated, that already done other\ncareers that maybe haven\u0026rsquo;t found their calling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nRight. And security is a great career. It\u0026rsquo;s a great industry, and we need to\nfind paths for those individuals. The individuals that have gone a career,\nhave spent 35, 10, 20 years, 30 years in a particular industry and now\nwant to go to cybersecurity. Like I said, internships does not work for\nthem. We won\u0026rsquo;t find them with internships because they will be too. Also,\nin a weird way, if somebody has a level of experience, you want to give\nthem a mandate, right? You give them good challenges. You want to say,\nlook, you might not have cybersecurity experience, but how to run a\nmeeting. How to run a team, how to deal under pressure, how to think\nlogic, how to read the GDPR standard and not fall asleep and be excited\nabout it. That\u0026rsquo;s the challenge that we need to give to those individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nOkay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nI think now it\u0026rsquo;s time for employers to rethink the process of hiring a\nperson and starting to give a newcomer a chance if we move the\nunemployment from the society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nYeah, but I think Billy, you mentioned right, like the impostor syndrome.\nRight? It\u0026rsquo;s real. Right. It\u0026rsquo;s, for me, very frustrating because I think most\nindividuals sometimes don\u0026rsquo;t understand where they add value. I\u0026rsquo;m telling\nyou, man, as an employee and as somebody who leads teams and I hire\nquite a bit and I work with other people, a lot of times the technical skills\nare important, but that\u0026rsquo;s not the main thing. Right. It\u0026rsquo;s how people think\nand how they learn, how they interact, how they respond under pressure,\nhow they have clarity of thought, how they learn, how they\u0026rsquo;re curious\nabout learning. Right. Those skills are way more important than whatever\nyou happen to land or whatever you happen to be paid to do, which is on\nyour CV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nRight, exactly. Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nAgreed with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nTotally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly:\nI also was listening recently to a podcast where they had a guest on who\nclaims he had his majors, he had his Master\u0026rsquo;s degree in cybersecurity and\nhe cannot find a job. That would be soul crushing, going through that\nmuch work and not being able to find work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nOkay. I can have you brutal on my answer. I don\u0026rsquo;t know the individual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly:\nI\u0026rsquo;m willing to bet I know the answer, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nThere has to be another reason. Nothing to do with cybersecurity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly:\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a possibility. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nOr going for roles that are crazy. Again, having a Master of Cybersecurity\nexperience doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you can take any jobs. Right. For me, it just\nmeans that you are able to actually do something that is very good\nacademic. To be honest, in cybersecurity, it\u0026rsquo;s actually really good for, a\nreasonable, not small, but not large amount of cybersecurity roles. It\ndepends what role he\u0026rsquo;s applying for. He or she, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. We have\nclose to 0% unemployment in cybersecurity. Right. If he had a degree on\nan esoteric. Right. Kind of. Okay, I\u0026rsquo;m going to make up a degree because\nthere\u0026rsquo;s always a crazy degree that people do. Right. If you have a degree, I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t know of creating lamppost. Right. Because I\u0026rsquo;m actually seeing a\nlamppost now. Right. You can\u0026rsquo;t find a job because you took a Master\u0026rsquo;s in\ncreating lampposts, I think. Yes. You may be struggling to find jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nRight. If you have a degree in cybersecurity and you\u0026rsquo;re struggling to find a\njob, then there\u0026rsquo;s something else that is not working. There\u0026rsquo;s something\nelse I play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly:\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nSorry. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Not in 2023.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly:\nYeah. I don\u0026rsquo;t know too much about the context there, but it did kind of\ncatch me by surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nYeah, but that\u0026rsquo;s like people that take a degree and go and work on a\ncheckout and supermarket. Right. Which, to be honest, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing\nwrong with it. Right. It\u0026rsquo;s a job. Right. Again, how you have your attitude\non it, but at the end of the day, you have to think strategic about your\ncareer. If you take a university degree on a job that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of\nmarket opportunity, then sorry, there\u0026rsquo;s literally a market economics at play\nhere. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nIt also depends on like he has masters of in cybersecurity and he\u0026rsquo;s\napplying for a job, but we don\u0026rsquo;t know if he getting calls for interview. Like\nhe has attended any interview and then rejected. Or in my case, I have also\nthe same, but if I get selected for the interview, then they reject it. That is\nsomething wrong in me. Like, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t clear the interview. What if you\nare applying and nobody and you are not getting calls for the interview?\nThen where you are wrong? What is the problem?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nWell, to be honest, look, one of the things that I always ask on our jobs\napplicants, I asked the candidates to create a presentation about\nthemselves. Right. We debate a lot about it. My point is that CVS are a\nhorrible way to review people. Right. Again, you have to take into account\nthat when people will have a job, and if you have 50 people, 100 people\napplying for a job, let\u0026rsquo;s say, ultimately you have to have a CV that stands\nout. Right. I like a presentation because it allows you to expose more\nabout who you are and what you do. At the end of the day, it\u0026rsquo;s about, for\nexample, having public participation. I don\u0026rsquo;t think we mentioned a lot\nhere, but like, open source projects are a great way to get experience.\nRight. Look, the summit, I know a lot of people who got jobs because they\ndid presentations at the Open City Summit during COVID There was a\ncouple of amazing individuals that got furloughed and they contributed a\nlot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nTheir career skyrocket because they were mass involved in the summit.\nThey helped, they met a lot of people. There\u0026rsquo;s lots of ways that you can\nstart to hack your way into the industry. Right. Again, the fact that there\u0026rsquo;s\na lot of jobs in cybersecurity doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you get a free pass. Right. You\nstill have to work really hard and you have to earn your spot because\nultimately it\u0026rsquo;s a competition. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nYou\u0026rsquo;re right, Dennis. I think maybe me and Karen will find a way and we\u0026rsquo;ll\ncome back to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nYeah, look, but this is important, right? I think sessions like this, they\nmake a difference. Right. Again, even from you\u0026rsquo;re building a brand, you\u0026rsquo;re\ncreating connections, you expanding and you\u0026rsquo;re learning. That\u0026rsquo;s who you\nwant, right? That\u0026rsquo;s who you want to hire, and that\u0026rsquo;s how you grow. Right.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s about making it fair for the right candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiran Gandhi:\nThank you. I think next time we will participate in panel discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nWe can do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nAbsolutely. There are a lot of people we can bring. There\u0026rsquo;s some amazing\nindividuals. I always mentioned Petra because she\u0026rsquo;s one of my rock stars.\nThat, again, she was a doctor. Right now is an amazing cybersecurity\nmanager professional, and let\u0026rsquo;s bring talent in. Let\u0026rsquo;s have a panel about,\nagain, the evolution and thinking and good examples on career paths.\nMaybe what we could do is let\u0026rsquo;s work maybe together on those examples\nof where to start. Right? Like, if you want to start here and, collect\nmaterials from OAS, from other things so that we can basically have a\nnice path or almost like journeys for the individuals that want to jump into\ncybersecurity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nThere you go. There\u0026rsquo;s our project for the next couple of months. And you\nguys going to be involved?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nYeah? Yes, me. Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nBrilliant. Okay, cool. Look, thanks for participating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nI hope our session was informational and people learned from it. Little bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz:\nBrilliant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurbhi Gupta:\nThank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly:\nAbsolutely.

And\nwe\u0026rsquo;re gonna we have a really cool panel, a really amazing set of panelists,\nand we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about Zero Trust architecture and strengthen\ncloud security posture. Very hot topic these days. So maybe just a quick\nround the room, the virtual room, everybody gives a quick introduction.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t we start with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 00:27\nOkay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 00:28\nI\u0026rsquo;m OGE. Okonor. I\u0026rsquo;m a lecturer in cybersecurity, University of\nRoehampton. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting to be in this panel today to talk about Zero\nTrust architecture. Knowing that as technology evolves, so is the\ncomplexity around technology and finding a subtle balance whereby we\ncan have maybe say, a good atmosphere of managing the things that goes\naround the network, the devices, the users, is interesting and I\u0026rsquo;m happy to\nbe here. Thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:11\nNathan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 01:13\nI\u0026rsquo;m Nathan Case. I am the CISO for CORSIA. I am currently speaking for\nmyself and all of my views are my own, obviously. So as we go through\nthis, I\u0026rsquo;m really excited to talk about Zero Trust and to figure out what\neverybody else thinks about architecture and how we can make it more\nsecure. And maybe if we go back to the pre banter, we can even bring\nsome AI into it. We\u0026rsquo;ll have to see how that goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:36\nThat\u0026rsquo;s my interest, how to make this thing scale. We kind of know what\nneeds to be done. We just need to make it really scale. So magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaciej Owsiany - 01:46\nHi guys. My name is Maciej Owsiany. I\u0026rsquo;m a technical architect, Planet it\none of the largest MSP providers in Oxfordshire. And the team that I\u0026rsquo;m\nworking with, we\u0026rsquo;re literally just writing strategies for the businesses. So\nwe speak to the executives, to the businesses and just basically making or\nproviding a good solutions for them. So the It system is more user friendly,\nbut it\u0026rsquo;s also as secure as it can be at the same time. So obviously I\u0026rsquo;m quite\ninteresting in the subject that we will be talking about today. So yeah,\ncool. Glad to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 02:26\nOh, too. Gabriel and you can call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 02:28\nSo gabriel yeah. Gabriel I\u0026rsquo;m director of Developer Relations permit IO.\nI\u0026rsquo;m in the software engineering landscape for the last ten years and have\nbeen since the beginning days of Zero Trust at the It perspective on\nnetwork. So it will be really delightful to talk today on the way Zero trust\nmodeling became across the year from a very It network hardware term\ninto something that every developer messing around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 03:06\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 03:06\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ll start with a short intro on zero trust itself, where it came from and\nwhat it meaning today. Well, so Zero Trust is a term that start became\ncommon, like I think between six to eight years ago from the walls of It.\nSo in the world before the cloud and with all on prem network, the\nnetwork being like complied by hardware, by ports, I were authenticated\nand authorized to the network by connecting my laptop to the wall to the\nport in the wall and that authenticate and secure me to the network. And\nthen the security model were based on perimeters instead of my identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 03:55\nThe security were based on the perimeter and my identity, like my IP, my\nphysical Mac address, et cetera, with all the cloud and the way that, for\nexample, a modern company does not have a network in their It, they have\njust the network from the ISP. And they use things like VPN and things like\nKnow Zero Trust Network, cloud Native network. So there is no\nimportance anymore to any perimeters because every session could be\ndifferent from every time an API being called or some network being\ncalled and that bring a new security model called Zero Trust. We do not\ntrust anything anywhere, for every request, for every packet, for\neverything. We want to know what is the identity behind this, what is the\ndevice behind it, what is the behavior behind it, and then we can get better\ndecision about our security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 04:57\nSo when we are modeling it, we are not looking on parameters anymore,\nwe are looking on more details or more inspectful trust. So we are not\ntrusting anything in one hand, but by the other end we are getting much\nstronger security model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 05:16\nYeah, it\u0026rsquo;s one of those things where I think the name is completely wrong,\nright? Because in a way I think it\u0026rsquo;s a good one because the concept is\nsound but it\u0026rsquo;s almost like context driven trust. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of like you start\nwith zero trust, fair enough, but then you evolve into giving trust access\nbased on what you know of who the user is, where it is, what he wants to\ndo, all sorts of properties. And in fact, the more properties and the more\nvariables you can add to the mix and the more adaptive that model is, in a\nway, the better it becomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 05:52\nYeah, exactly. So it\u0026rsquo;s kind of confusing because you say zero trust but then\nyou gain much more trust than you have ever before. Yeah, the name is\nmaybe not the best one, but again, everyone familiar with it today and\nhence we can build nice context and behavior based on Zero Trust with\n100 trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 06:17\nI think the name somehow captured what the intention was, which is never\ntrust anybody, no matter what, when it comes to the infrastructure and the\nIt lifecycle. Because looking at it critically is all about security strategies.\nSo what are the strategies we can put in place to make sure that we are\nwho we tend to be or who we are today? Because every day things change,\npeople change, intention changes, pressures of life can also change how\npeople perceive things from yesterday. That means if I have some\npercentage of trust today and the person tends to change, why I\u0026rsquo;m still in\nthat yastic of that percentage. You see, I\u0026rsquo;m vulnerable to threats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 07:09\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s technically reflecting what it\u0026rsquo;s meant to do, whereby no matter\nwhat, no matter my relationship with you, when it comes to it world there\nis no any trust anywhere unless I can test your trust and validate that you\nare trustworthy for the moment I\u0026rsquo;m with you, which can be subject to\nchange. The Nest moment bringing us to the cardinals when we talk about\nit from the academic point of view, looking at the Nest framework where\nit\u0026rsquo;s always saying try to verify never trust. Make sure that the person is\nwho it tends to be, look at the policies, look at the privileges, they must\nnot have it because they used it yesterday, they have this privilege because\nthey need it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 08:00\nAnd once it\u0026rsquo;s done, try to always continuously look at what people are\ndoing, how the system work, the devices, the users and when you look at it\nbased on the cloud point of view then it becomes a little bit more complex\nbecause you now classify it into having the cloud centric one and the user\ncentric view. So you are looking at the cloud centric where you are looking\nat different embodiments of cloud in multicloud system and the\ncompliances and the people with the third parties sometimes you can\u0026rsquo;t\neven control them. So zero trust still fits in well with the scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaciej Owsiany - 08:47\nIf I could just add a little bit to that. So obviously, I think for those who\nmay listen to us and may have not clue what the ZTNA aspect is, an entire\nconcept. I always like that metaphor when someone explained long time\nago, when obviously these days the cybersecurity is super important, the\ndata being everywhere, all of those SaaS services and things like that,\nwhere we actually don\u0026rsquo;t know where the data is in 100%. I always like\nthat comparison that it\u0026rsquo;s almost like obviously one of the principle is that\nwe always have to verify never trust but always verify the parameter or\nthe device. And it\u0026rsquo;s almost like, let\u0026rsquo;s say if you know the employee and you\nknow that employee is in a building and has a badge, you cannot always\nassume that employee needs to have access to the data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaciej Owsiany - 09:47\nI always like that metaphor when I was explaining what is a ZTNA model\nand how the entire concept works. But basically today we look at that\nemployee and we may say, okay, is in a building. It was here yesterday. It\nhas an access to that certain data within a building. But we don\u0026rsquo;t know\nwhat could have happened a week or two weeks ago. And maybe that\nemployee has already been sort of let go from the job and cannot be in\nthat building anymore. And that\u0026rsquo;s sort of the principle of ZTNA\narchitecture that we always have to check the devices, we always have to\ncheck the environment that is accessing from and trying to access the\ndata. So I think I don\u0026rsquo;t know myself. I\u0026rsquo;ve always liked to explain it this\nway to the people who had no idea about the ZTNA concept and overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 10:42\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 10:49\nSo I think specifically the nice thing that happened from zero trust\nnetwork architecture is the way that it shifted into zero trust software\narchitecture because it became like together with the trend of OAuth in\nJWT. Today, when I\u0026rsquo;m authenticating a user to a session as an application\ndeveloper with no matter which network is just on the Internet, I\npractically authenticate the user every time they are doing a request,\nwhich is something that never happened before. What we did is like having\none session for the user with a session ID. After they put once a password,\nwe just know that it\u0026rsquo;s them, right? And then we have parameter, we might\ncheck their behavior, check if something change in the location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 11:46\nToday with JWTs, which is JSON web token that we verify every time a\nuser passing them, we are authenticating user every moment they are\nrequesting something from the cloud. And not only that, with the modern\nauthorization framework, every small, let\u0026rsquo;s say, encapsulated function call\nin the cloud is happening with completely zero trust. And that\u0026rsquo;s nice to see\nthat the network trends came together with the application trend. And\ntoday if we are looking on cloud native architectures like Kubernetes and\nvery modern cloud native network mesh and Envoy and stuff like that, we\ncan see that these both zero trust trends, one is the zero trust network\narchitecture and the other is JWTs. And the way that we are authenticating\nuser and devices became together into like zero trust application\narchitecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 12:48\nBut we still have a lot of complexity, right? I think we elevated the\nabstraction layer a couple notches up, but I still feel that in most apps, the\ncomplexity of the relationships is still really hard to understand. And that\u0026rsquo;s\na blocker for adding more zero trust because at the end of the day, you\ncould only do this when you can really understand or able to model the\nbehavior that you want and then you can apply those controls on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 13:18\nI would say that we\u0026rsquo;re kind of dancing around a couple of questions here.\nWe definitely have the zero trust network architecture, which is what a\ncouple of us have already talked about, right? We\u0026rsquo;re going to set up a\nphysical hardware available. We\u0026rsquo;re going to set up a physical hardware\nidentification from my laptop all the way out to a server somewhere and\nevaluate whether or not I actually am me the entire time that I\u0026rsquo;m\ncommunicating with this target. And that\u0026rsquo;s good. That\u0026rsquo;s really important.\nThe problem is that, as Gabriel pointed out, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t really mean much\nif the attacker is actually on my laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 13:51\nIf my laptop has already been popped and we\u0026rsquo;re beginning to see attacks\ngo through that zero trust connection between my laptop and the target\napplication, then all of a sudden, we begin to wonder, well, why is Nathan\nbeginning to do these things? And what data might be leaking out to the\nside. And I think as we kind of pull back and I\u0026rsquo;d kind of like to pull the\ndiscussion back a bit and start looking at what are the things that we\nactually need to provide zero trust for. Certainly my laptop is important\nand the non person entities in line here are important. We want to make\nsure that those are consistently and continuously identified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 14:27\nTo Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s point JWTs being exceptionally important, we want to make\nsure every time somebody makes a request, that request is authenticated\nall the way back to me to make sure that it actually came from me and it\nactually went to the server and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t somebody trying to laterally move\nin our environment. And as we look at all of the architecture and all the\noptions in front of us, I kind of want to look at it from the architecture\npoint down where I want to make sure that the architecture has been laid\nout so that the laptop is connected to the server or the infrastructure in\nsuch a way that we\u0026rsquo;re sure that it\u0026rsquo;s the laptop and then all of the things\nthat happen in between that tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 15:05\nAssuming we\u0026rsquo;ve created a tunnel, then those things also are assumed or\nproven rather not assumed to have come from the laptop and have\nexecuted and been sent back. And I think that\u0026rsquo;s one of the ways that we,\nas I suppose security geeks, as architects, begin to be able to prove long\nterm that the things we\u0026rsquo;re doing are actually helping. It gives us a nice\ndetection ability, it gives us a nice ability to identify people and hardware.\nSo I agree with you Gabriel. I think that\u0026rsquo;s the way to begin. I just want to\nmake sure that we pull all the way back out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaciej Owsiany - 15:46\nYeah, go ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 15:48\nI also want to add that for every organization and business, they have the\nreason why they want to apply zero trust. So what one organization define\nas their assets and their priority based on their own business use, case and\nrequirement can be very different from the other. But the only good thing\nabout zero Cross that cuts across everyone is that it\u0026rsquo;s making people talk.\nUsers, clients, everyone wants to get your own view of what works for\nyour deployment and it\u0026rsquo;s bringing that harmony and community whereby\nwe can look at it as this is the best practice that is already working based\non this architecture. And if I try to borrow some of the mechanism used in\nthis, it can also work on my own architecture, fitting into my own business\ndrive and the priorities around the business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 16:44\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s not just like a one way methodology that works in a static manner?\nNo. If it\u0026rsquo;s not dynamic, then it can fit into cloud posture and it becomes a\nlittle bit compromised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 16:55\nI can see hand off just to help the sequence of events. Right. So if it wants\nto go, please finish. I just going to say that next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 17:09\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s an interesting statement to make about cloud. So it depends on\nhow you\u0026rsquo;ve implemented your cloud, I think. OG. Is that the appropriate\nway? I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, I didn\u0026rsquo;t ask to begin with. So I would tend to push back on\nthe statement and say Ogie. I believe that architecture in general is\nindependent of whether it is static, dynamic, transitory, take your pick of\nword that you would look at the cloud with, but rather the architecture\nthat would go in and make a zero trust model work for your particular\ncustomer. I think the statement that you made about community and\ncommunication that kind of brings that architecture point all the way\nback to the very beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 17:57\nIf we\u0026rsquo;re trying to architect a zero trust model for, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, pick a\ncompany that\u0026rsquo;s more than 100 years old and they\u0026rsquo;re looking to go ahead\nand implement that zero trust model in an application that\u0026rsquo;s 20 years old,\nthat\u0026rsquo;s going to be a really hard thing to do. Yes. Is it possible? Absolutely.\nIs it easy? Absolutely not. And as we look at the things that we\u0026rsquo;re\ndeveloping now, as we look at the cloud first applications, the serverless\napplications, it becomes really easy for us to spin up both endpoints, both\nthe proof of my laptop and the proof of the API endpoint inside of I\u0026rsquo;m\ngoing to go with AWS because that\u0026rsquo;s where I\u0026rsquo;m familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 18:34\nGoing to go to the endpoint inside my VPC that\u0026rsquo;s connecting directly to my\nAPI gateway and that actually allows me to get all the way out to my\nserverless cluster and then all the way back into my laptop pretty easily.\nAnd I can then go ahead and do Gabriel\u0026rsquo;s JWT evaluation of each\ndiscussion point of each API request and return. So I think as we get into\nit\u0026rsquo;s a question of architecture. And that architecture that builds the\ncommunity that you just talked about really has to happen at the very\nbeginning of the application, or it\u0026rsquo;s a very intense conversation about the\n20 year old app, if you will, as we try to figure out how to put the walls\naround that really old application and figure out what that is. That\u0026rsquo;s\nactually one of the reasons I work for Porsche.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 19:18\nThat\u0026rsquo;s one of the things that Porsche can do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaciej Owsiany - 19:23\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I think Nathan, if I can add to what you just said, I think it\u0026rsquo;s\nimportant for businesses to obviously make an investment. Understand it\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t work for every business. But what we\u0026rsquo;re trying to do from our\nperspective, if we\u0026rsquo;re designing those systems, we\u0026rsquo;re trying to push\nbusinesses to invest money into just more modern up to date system\nbecause obviously then a ZTNA concept, it\u0026rsquo;s much more harder to\nachieve. And as you\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned, if someone have perfectly designed\narchitecture from the server point of view, from again cloud point of view\nand stuff like that but if the one parameter of that architecture is the\nsoftware which is over 20 years old, which is not patched properly, and\njust other things after that, then obviously it\u0026rsquo;s going to be much harder to\nget that ZTNA concept achieved in the longer term.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaciej Owsiany - 20:16\nSo absolutely agree with what we just said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 20:19\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 20:20\nThe comment I was going to add is that when you implement a good Zero\nTrust strategy across the multiple areas, and I think we can agree that you\nstart an acquire network, go all the way to the app and the roles and et\ncetera, right. There\u0026rsquo;s significant business benefits, like literally significant\nbusiness benefits, right? In fact, we just deployed recently a new office and\neverything was Zero Trust. It was super quick, effective. The business\ndecides to change in a last minute, oh, we\u0026rsquo;re going to go to that one, not\nthis one, right? Office, which happens, right? And were like, cool, fine.\nDoes he have Internet? That was the first question. Does he have Internet?\nIf he had, off you go. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 20:58\nAnd even like our warehouses now and a lot of our deployments and even\nour stores, I would argue that a lot of times in security, what we are a\nreally good canary in a coal mine analogy of other problems. Right? So I\nwould argue that if you cannot start to implement the Zero Trust\nstrategies or let\u0026rsquo;s say Zero Trust architectures, you have much bigger\nproblems and you actually should start to address them because that will\nimpact the business. Right. These days, I think the advantage of having\nclean, effective modern architectures versus not is literally the difference\nbetween being profitable at this level or that level, being effective at this\nlevel versus that level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 21:36\nWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 21:36\nI think a lot of people, and you guys make an interesting comment that I\nwould disagree a little bit, which is the solution to improve a system,\nwhich by the way, you have systems that were deployed last month that\nalready legacy, that are already a massive shit show, right? So you don\u0026rsquo;t\nhave to go back 20 years to find systems that have been badly\nimplemented and badly deployed that already are a massive mess, right?\nSo I think the way to always do transformation is to hollowing out, right?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s basically you take a bit, you move, you take a bit, you move, you\nreplace, you do a replacement on top of the other one, make sure this is\ngood, get rid of that one now go to the next bit and then that is an\nevolutionary step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 22:15\nBut my key point is that the business advantages of implementing what\nwe\u0026rsquo;re asking here, which is segmentation, good control, good visibility,\ngood role based access, the side effects are massive from an organization\npoint of view. So it\u0026rsquo;s almost like, ironically, security is not even the main\nbeneficiary of a good Zero Trust deployment. I think security can be the\ndriver because I think it touches us in some ways more than initially other\nteams and we are very motivated by implementing zero trust network\nbecause they allow us to do our job much better and have a lot better\nvisibility. But there is very real business benefit for implementing a lot of\nthese strategies and practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 23:02\nI think one of the things that came to my mind after Megan made a\nstatement about OAuth is the way that zero trust is letting us chaining\nsecurity. What I mean, so I used to work on a product, it\u0026rsquo;s a famous\nproduct called AAA server Authentication, Authorization and Accounting\nServer which is server for many traditional network. Using that you can\nhave a session in your network and then you can check for postures, check\nfor password, et cetera. Authenticate an authorized user to the network.\nNow, the way that traditional network work was like a session, usually\ntime based session. So someone connects to their computer in the morning\nand let\u0026rsquo;s say the username password has like lifetime of 24 hours. So every\nmorning they came to the laptop, connect the laptop and then the session\nstart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 23:56\nAnd if we need to get to strength this session, we use strategies like\npostures. So we say hey, we see that something suspicious happened in the\nperimeter something happened in the laptop, some software is not updated\nand then we update the session, we strength the security but in the end we\nare always in the same session. If for example, something happened to this\nparticular huge 24 hours session, everything were failed. The way we zero\ntrust is we are not vertically scaling our sessions anymore, we are\nhorizontally scaling them. So we have like many micro session that for\neach one we can decide on the right security model for this one. So we\nhave the network session that I\u0026rsquo;m connecting to the network in my home\nwhich has a perimeter and has some limitations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 24:49\nSo I cannot access some cloud services because this particular session is\nnot enough and then I\u0026rsquo;m connecting to the VPN but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean\nnow I have a session for everything, we have another session. So for\nexample, I can now access some cloud services because the it can be sure\nthat I\u0026rsquo;m in a secure network and then I have another session for a specific\ncloud service but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I have a session for other service. At\nthe end when we analyzing it, we can still analyze it once because at the\nend I have one identity but the trust is getting to zero. So the way we are\nnow scaling session in this horizontal chaining of session, getting much\nsecure way for networks which is zero trust but also making a stronger\nconnection between applications and network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 25:44\nSo we don\u0026rsquo;t need to have contract between applications and network to\ndecide security and decide session and based parameter we can have each\nproduct, each application, their own network and other ensure that they\ntrust on the contract that they are on this is another point that I feel\ngetting better with Zero Trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaciej Owsiany - 26:08\nSo I think, Gabriel, we just said obviously it also applies to the\nsegmentation of the network. Absolutely. And it\u0026rsquo;s really important because\nalso, I\u0026rsquo;m just referring to what you said, Dennis, previously, that some\nbusinesses, even if they applied some of those concepts of ZTNA, it will\nbenefit them. Because again, if we\u0026rsquo;re looking at the businesses which have\nbeen segmented previously so whether the right VLANs were in place,\nwhether as you said, Gabriel, they were accessing one session, but they\ncould not have access others, it makes them essentially much more secure.\nBecause again, you have the one identity, you\u0026rsquo;re accessing it from one\ndevice, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t give you access to pretty much entire network. I\nthink the segmentation it\u0026rsquo;s the right approach in terms of what businesses\nshould do. I think we should just.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 27:19\nAdvantages are critical. Right. And I think this is where I think in security,\nwe don\u0026rsquo;t in fact, I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s a security. I would say in technology we\nneed better ways to show the value of what we\u0026rsquo;re driving and to show the\nvalue of, for example, the resilience that you get with segmentation of\nnetworks, the reduction of the blast radio that happens on networks.\nWhen you do have segmentation, when you do say, look, I\u0026rsquo;m having really\ninteresting conversation with the business now where we mapping not\nnecessarily our crown jewels because we know them, but we\u0026rsquo;re mapping\nsome of the playbooks of what happens in certain scenarios. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of\nlike, hey, the thing is on fire, who do we run to protect? Right? It\u0026rsquo;s kind of\nlike we assume we\u0026rsquo;re going to lose half the business, which we save first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 28:05\nAnd it\u0026rsquo;s interesting because your instinct might be wrong, right. You might\nbe going and protecting the wrong things, where let\u0026rsquo;s say in a retail\nenvironment, we want to make sure our stores are still operating. If they\noperate, we have two to six to 8 hours to do things. Our warehouse can be\ndown for a day, right? It shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be. It\u0026rsquo;s a massive problem, but we can\nrecover from that because any space, we can put things in place. Right.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s important to know what does it take. But also, for example, the\nwarehouse should be one of the last ones to go down. So it\u0026rsquo;s important to\nstart understanding. And segmentations allows you to have a much better\nunderstanding of the blast radius. So you can say, look, if that thing there\ncatches fire, it\u0026rsquo;s okay, we have our fire doors closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 28:49\nWe block that environment. Right. So then we prevent spread into other\nparts of the organization. That zero trust. Control is a key part of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 29:00\nI think you\u0026rsquo;ve touched on the reality, though, Dennis, and Magic, that the\nreal world implementation of Zero Trust is much different than the\nconversation we\u0026rsquo;re having right now. And the sad reality is that many of\nthe network administrators that are going to go, hey, cool, I\u0026rsquo;m going to go\ntake your pick of zero trust provider. I\u0026rsquo;m going to go buy that zero trust\nprovider and we\u0026rsquo;re going to get rid of our VPN. Wait, what? That may well\nbe the conversation that they have, but the conversation isn\u0026rsquo;t just, I\u0026rsquo;m\ngoing to go install your zero trust provider on everybody\u0026rsquo;s laptop and\nconnect it back to the networking core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 29:36\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a whole set of work here that I think gets kind of we\u0026rsquo;ve talked\nover it and around it, but somebody\u0026rsquo;s actually got to do the micro\nsegmentation so that they have the ability to connect and prove that my\nlaptop is my laptop. And it\u0026rsquo;s really Nathan sitting here, and I\u0026rsquo;m really\nconnecting off to the application that we need to have Nathan connect to.\nAnd I can no longer laterally move inside of my network or inside of my\ncompany\u0026rsquo;s core, which is a massive change for many people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 30:07\nBut again, connect that to exactly right. If you connect that to the risk\nprofile. So the other thing that we\u0026rsquo;re working, I agree with you because\nwe have our graph. You know me, I always map everything in graphs.\nRight. And now again with Gen AI, we started to get to a point which I\nalways wanted, which is to be able to not just go to an executive and say,\nhere\u0026rsquo;s your top risks. Here\u0026rsquo;s the stuff which to say, hey, here\u0026rsquo;s your risk\nprofile, here\u0026rsquo;s what you own, here\u0026rsquo;s what your team owns, here\u0026rsquo;s the side\neffects. And by the way, if that dude from your team is compromised,\nyou\u0026rsquo;re blowing up that environment over there. Right. And in a weird way,\nit\u0026rsquo;s allowing the business to protect itself. So there might be business. They\ngo, that\u0026rsquo;s fine, I\u0026rsquo;m okay, I\u0026rsquo;ll take the risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 30:46\nMaybe other business who go, whoa, hold on. I don\u0026rsquo;t want my\nenvironment to be blown up because that team has this thing. And then\nyou start asking really good questions, why do you need it? Who needs it?\nAnd then you make people accountable. You say, hey, it\u0026rsquo;s impossible for\nsecurity to maintain all the roles. Right. It just will never scale. It has to be\nalmost whoever\u0026rsquo;s making the decision. We need to give that risk and that\nmappings to that risk owner. And that\u0026rsquo;s the person that needs to be able to\nmake those decisions. And sometimes they get wrong and we work with\nthem or we get their boss to validate it. Right. But that scales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaciej Owsiany - 31:23\nExactly. And also just to add to this one, again, the world that we\u0026rsquo;re living\ntoday, it\u0026rsquo;s much harder to control in terms of the devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 31:35\nExactly. Because sometimes we want to map it in our head. But when it\ncomes to practicality, it\u0026rsquo;s not that so practical to know that I\u0026rsquo;m trying to\nmap this. It\u0026rsquo;s always mapped against devices and data. So you are looking\nat where would the breach come from and what are the. Suspected attack.\nSo if I can be able to map according to this target audience and target\ndevice based on the behavior system point of view, then I can assign some\nkind of policy or whatever to be able to trace the behavior and the things,\nthe transaction that goes through. However, it\u0026rsquo;s easier when you\u0026rsquo;re under\na simple or small enterprise, but when you come into multi cloud\nenvironments, maybe you are using Azure and AWS or you are using your\non premise with the parameter security around it, and you\u0026rsquo;ve outsourced\nto third party too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 32:36\nIt becomes a little bit tricky in the sense that I\u0026rsquo;m trying to shrink my target\nparameters based on these, to make sure that I\u0026rsquo;ve assumed the core\nprinciples of zero trust, which is assume breach at all time. So that it\nmakes you suspicious of everyone\u0026rsquo;s activity and be able to segment people\nbased on rules and policies so that if anything happens, I can be able to go\nto the puzzle and equation to see where the red light started from and\ntrace it down to that. But it\u0026rsquo;s easier when it\u0026rsquo;s smaller than when it gets\ninto a complex cloud architecture. It becomes more tricky. I can see Natan\nis like, no, I don\u0026rsquo;t agree with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 33:34\nYeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t agree with you. And I respect the point of view. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to\nfigure out trying to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 33:42\nFigure out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 33:46\nWhat the best retort would be. So logging an understanding of an identity,\nregardless of whether that be a machine or a person, what have you\u0026rsquo;ve\ntouched on a couple of things there. One is the identity appropriate for\nthis action. And I think the question of identity is key. So are you really\nyou? Is Gabriel really Gabriel? He looks like he might be an AI. To me. If\nGabriel is an AI, how do I prove that he\u0026rsquo;s really Gabriel? Well, I\u0026rsquo;ve got\nbehaviorals. I\u0026rsquo;ve got all sorts of things that can prove to me that he\u0026rsquo;s a\nhuman. We do really funny things with the mice, with the mouse pointer.\nBut all of that there as an identity or a fingerprint of a human is fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 34:40\nI think as we get into the part that I disagree with most, it was really\naround the concept of it becomes more complicated when you get into the\ncloud and a cloud implementation. One of the things that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen having\nbuilt lots of data centers, is that when you build a data center hundreds of\nsquare feet or hundreds of thousands of square feet, and you have lots and\nlots of servers, and you have to figure out how they\u0026rsquo;re all connected.\nPeople make really bad decisions really quickly, and when you put them in\nthe cloud, in many cases they can make fewer bad decisions because they\nhappen to do it a little bit differently than they would do it in a data\ncenter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 35:14\nSo in many cases, in my experience, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen people be able to implement\nin a large cloud just as well or better because I have the ability to control\nsome of the services directly and those services are directly mapped to an\nAPI. And because they\u0026rsquo;re directly mapped to an API, I can then go ahead\nand get the logs. But many of those things then become a question of and\nto your point and the part that I agree with is that humans do stupid\nthings. We just do. I almost locked myself out of my hotel room last night.\nBut those types of things that happen because we don\u0026rsquo;t have time or we\ndon\u0026rsquo;t think or we don\u0026rsquo;t make the choices that we need to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 35:53\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;m not 100% sure that it\u0026rsquo;s dependent on cloud data center or frankly\nthe network that I keep in my basement. I think it turns into more a\nquestion of did I actually spend the time to arc detect it correctly and did I\nspend the time to actually think about I need to figure out how to evaluate\nthat. You\u0026rsquo;re you and I think that\u0026rsquo;s an identity issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 36:12\nYou have the time and you spent it right trying to do all the calculation.\nStill, we are human. There is what we call human factor whereby\naccidentally with no intention of doing those things is always\nmisconfiguration issue. So things can happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 36:30\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a question of configuration versus architecture. If we\u0026rsquo;re talking\narchitecture and the five of us sit down and we spend a week and we\narchitect something, the goal would be that we\u0026rsquo;ve checked each other\u0026rsquo;s\nerrors and certainly bad things can happen. But the question of\nmisconfiguration becomes a question at that point of should we have\nautomated this better? And not a question of necessarily zero trust or\nidentity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 36:54\nSee more and more. First of all, I have a massive problem with the word\nstupid, right? And basic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 37:00\nI owned it myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:03\nBut even now in example, it\u0026rsquo;s not that you were stupid. You put it in a\nplace where you can make a big error, right, or a big problem, right?\nBecause first of all, if it\u0026rsquo;s basic, people would do it, right? I think the worst\nthing we can do in security is why don\u0026rsquo;t just do it? It\u0026rsquo;s so simple, it\u0026rsquo;s so\nbasic that is so offensive. If you\u0026rsquo;re on the other side and you go dude, step\non my shoes for a second and you realize it\u0026rsquo;s nothing like basic. But the\nthing about the stupid part, and I think again, we do that in security and\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been guilty of that too in the past, right, is the fact that I really like if\nyou haven\u0026rsquo;t seen the Three Mile Island analysis and story, which is pretty\namazing and it was a nuclear disaster in US.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 37:39\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s a great analysis where they did a review of it and for some\ngood reason, the people who did the review were actually really good. So\ninstead of looking at the root cause of the problem which they figured out\nwhat physically actually happened that led to the nuclear problem. Yes,\nthere\u0026rsquo;s a sequence of events, but what they did was they look at the\nsecondary stories, like this story that they put a whole bunch of people\nthat used to run a nuclear reactor in a submarine in a power station and\nthey never made the transition effectively. So your signals in a nuclear\nreactor, in a submarine are very different than the signals that you care\nabout in a power station. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 38:22\nAnd I think what\u0026rsquo;s very interesting is that those second stories, which is\nthe thing that happened, or the real root cause, which, for example, in\nmost vulnerabilities, you know why, is because there was no time given to\nproper testing, no time given to architecture, no time given to reviews, no\ntime given to education. That\u0026rsquo;s why the vulnerability was created, right?\nAnd these days I like the human events because you know what they are?\nThey are your warning signs. So my argument these days is that if we\nallow a user to do an action that has a massive impact, the user is not the\nproblem, right. Even to the point of malicious, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:06\nBecause even if the user is malicious, right, even if it\u0026rsquo;s an insider, to be\nfair, you will be extremely unlucky that the first time that you see\nsomething from a malicious insider is the one, is the really clever one who\nreally going to do a lot of damage, who\u0026rsquo;s really going to basically cause a\nmassive problem. What you\u0026rsquo;re going to have is you\u0026rsquo;re going to have a lot\nof, let\u0026rsquo;s say, inexperienced or not very sophisticated users that are going to\ntry to do something malicious and they\u0026rsquo;re kind of going to do something\nbad, they\u0026rsquo;re going to kind of stumble and they\u0026rsquo;re not going to be able to\nreally do a lot of damage. I don\u0026rsquo;t think what we sometimes do very well is\npay attention to those. So in a way, I like the users because the users\nshould have common sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 39:48\nThey need to do their job and if they cause a lot of damage, it\u0026rsquo;s not their\nfault. It\u0026rsquo;s our fault. These days, we don\u0026rsquo;t allow engineers to go to\nproduction or we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t allow engineers to go into production and\ngoing, yeah, let me just click on things to see what works, right? We have\nchange control, we do infrastructure as code, we have peer reviews. Why?\nBecause we\u0026rsquo;ve learned that even the best person might make a mistake\nand the stakes are so high. But what you also do is you catch the mistakes,\nyou catch the errors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 40:15\nAnd then again, my view would be very simply, every time a bug is\nreported that you don\u0026rsquo;t know about or a security issue that you don\u0026rsquo;t\nknow about, that should be a P one or at least a P two, because for that to\nhappen, 20 things have failed already, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 40:35\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s the trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 40:36\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the trick right there. So users, in a way, you think, oh, I left my key\nin the thing. But that\u0026rsquo;s because you have a stupid authentication system,\nright? These days you can have much better, right? Maybe use your phone,\nuse other things. And by the way, the key cards in hotels are let\u0026rsquo;s not go\nthere. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 40:55\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t have my flipper zero with me. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 40:57\nExactly. Right. But I think that\u0026rsquo;s, again, user experience. So more and\nmore, I like those P ones, P two S and P three S, and those things caught\nby users because they will allow us, for example, to understand our blast\nradius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 41:15\nLet me pull back from that word stupid. I think that\u0026rsquo;s probably part of it.\nAnd I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean to trigger you. I apologize. I\u0026rsquo;m looking at humanity as\nhumanity. One of the things that we tend to do is forget to clean out the\nbelly button lid, right? Like, we don\u0026rsquo;t wash our feet, we forget to wash the\nbelly button. It\u0026rsquo;s just one of those things. We don\u0026rsquo;t do the basic hygiene\nthing that humans are supposed to do. And when you look back at the last\n100 years of humanity, that\u0026rsquo;s a continued response. And to your, what\nabout the other 20 failures? And I think that\u0026rsquo;s a great answer for it. It\u0026rsquo;s\nthe monotony of every day that really gets all of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 41:50\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the thing that we don\u0026rsquo;t think about because we\u0026rsquo;ve done it 50 times and\nwe forget to do it that one time that locks you out of your hotel room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 41:56\nYeah, but in business, I think we need to think of security as the side\neffects of basically a lot of times, processes that are not well implemented\nor not very well mature. That\u0026rsquo;s why developers, again, have a massive\nproblem when we talk about developers as if they were doing it on\npurpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaciej Owsiany - 42:19\nAnd also what you said, Nathan, I really like that, because you said if\nsomething didn\u0026rsquo;t happen 20 times, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that it may not happen.\nObviously, that\u0026rsquo;s why the architecture needs to be designed perfectly. And\nas you said, Dennis, we tend to blame the users because they\u0026rsquo;ve done a\nstupid thing and they\u0026rsquo;ve done this or they\u0026rsquo;ve done that, but it needs to be\ndown to the system which is designed ultimately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 42:51\nThen you also have the case of architects and systems that are designed\nthat are completely unrealistic. I never forget once this guy was showing\nme this insane, probably the most beautiful authentication authorization\nsystem I\u0026rsquo;ve seen, right? And the guy showed me that. And we\u0026rsquo;re thinking,\ncan anybody else apart from you and that dude actually write this\nproperly? Write this in this way? And he\u0026rsquo;s like, no. See, that\u0026rsquo;s the problem,\nright? The problem is you don\u0026rsquo;t scale because your company is growing.\nNow you\u0026rsquo;re going to have ten people creating systems that increase the\nattack surface, and you created a solution. So I would argue that it\u0026rsquo;s bad\narchitecture. You could say that it\u0026rsquo;s the most beautiful. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s zero\ntrust. Right? Amazing architecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 43:36\nBut I would argue it\u0026rsquo;s a bad architecture because in the real world it will\ncause tons of problems because it\u0026rsquo;s not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaciej Owsiany - 43:43\nWhich essentially I may be controversial here, but the concept sometimes\nmay not be ideal for all of the businesses, but part of the concept, as long\nas those businesses will be implementing part of that concept at the time, I\nthink that is going to make them safer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 44:07\nI think that goes all the way back to Gabriel and the original comment\nthat you made around application security and identity. It\u0026rsquo;s a long walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 44:22\nI think, getting back to the AI discussion. Yeah. So I think the thing that\nwe are going to see sooner or later getting into software is identities that\nactually based on AI, not Gabriel, that is maybe AI. So agents, bots, stuff\nlike that, we are seeing them getting more and more, especially where\nthere are advanced user. So for example, if you look on GitHub today,\nevery agent, let\u0026rsquo;s call it every tool that you are running as part of your CI\nCD is someone with identity and with all the supply chain security, we also\nneed to secure them. So, for example, if I\u0026rsquo;m now delivering code and I\u0026rsquo;m\nrunning like eight, maybe ten tools on that code for security, for testing,\nfor code coverage, for static analysis, et cetera, each one of them is a\nsecurity pillar. Because they can change my code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 45:30\nThey can maybe stall it. They can even modify it on the way to production.\nThey can pretend to someone else. We saw like an attack a couple of\nmonths ago that attackers pretend to depend about, which is a popular\nbot by GitHub to fix third party libraries. They pretend to depend about\nand make developers to think that they need to merge changes. But those\nchanges were vulnerable. So the pillars in the modern security are not\nidentities and devices anymore. They have much more meaning if, for\nexample, I have an AI boat that from their roles or from their\nresponsibilities can do the same as a human identity can do, but also have\na level of control as a device can do. So how do I manage all these\nsessions? How do I manage all these pillars? How do I authenticate and\nauthorize them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 46:34\nAnd I think this world of having much more than just identities and\ndevices, or identities and devices and servers is getting more and more\nexciting with all these zero trust architectures and better security models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:52\nWell, the thing about this is that if you think about it, the one thing we can\nknow and do a worldly map on this, and you could totally see, by the way,\nthe session on Monday on Worldly Maps had a bit on it where Simon really\ntalked about the innovate, leverage and commoditize, which is one of the\nbest ones I\u0026rsquo;ve seen. But we know that deep fakes identity impersonation,\nthe quality of the impersonation is going to go to the roofs. Right. It\u0026rsquo;s\nalmost a question of when, not if. Now. And I think that actually could\nhave a positive effect. I think it\u0026rsquo;s going to cause a big shock in society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 47:30\nBut the end of it could be a really demand, a real demand in strong\nidentity, in a real demand in really being able to identify who\u0026rsquo;s who\u0026rsquo;s,\nsaying what, how do I trust that entity versus that entity, even in business,\nright. How to create trust relationships within things. And that\u0026rsquo;s very\npositive because at the moment, a lot of the identity requirements that we\nhave are still very fuzzy. And I think that will be quite positive. And again,\nthat\u0026rsquo;s one of the pillars of zero trust, right. You need to know who\u0026rsquo;s who.\nSo I feel that is know. In a weird way, the exploitation of know is going to\ndrive that. It\u0026rsquo;s quite funny. I listened to the interview from Gary McGraw\nrecently, and somebody asked him if you know Gary McGraw, he\u0026rsquo;s a\nlegend in our world, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:17\nAsked him, what is the biggest innovation in the last seven years? Right?\nAnd he said, can I say ransomware? Because in it was a good innovation\nfrom the criminals, but it actually drove a lot of behaviors. It made\nsecurity a lot more real, and it was going to happen anyway. Right. Those\ndie intersection was on the cars. It\u0026rsquo;s just that you happen to be with that\nparticular thing. So sometimes an advance in the malicious capability to\ndo something creates the business drive to actually do some things for\nreal, because you cannot busk those things. Which is why these days, we\ndo have decent crypto, we do have decent tools. We do have different\nencryption. Regardless, think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:00\nOf a large number of key players not wanting us to have encryption in our\ndevices, we still have a decent level of encryption for most of us. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 49:13\nCool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:13\nAny final words on this topic? You guys can continue for a bit. I do need to\njump into my other session, but feel free to continue if you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 49:23\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 49:27\nAnd I did google you. I hope that\u0026rsquo;s okay. It looks like you\u0026rsquo;re a teacher at a\nschool, at a college.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 49:36\nYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 49:38\nHow does this play in for your students? I would think zero trust at a\ncollege level would just be like mind numbingly hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 49:48\nIt depends on how you see it. So from which perspective do you want to\nlook at it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 49:54\nFrom yours?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 49:54\nActually, I would assume from the students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 49:58\nIt just magically works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 50:00\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just that it\u0026rsquo;s like a boss world. Everybody is talking about zero trust\nthen looking at it based on the reality around zero trust is interesting\nwhereby you can be giving a particular kind of network and tell you to\nlook at the kind of things you can do to be able to implement the principal\ncardinals of zero trust whereby you look at the list privileges. Why did you\naccept that and assign that to the risk privileges? What have you looked at\nby quantifying that? These APIs or this part of the work will be assumed\ntargeted bridges and what will be the mechanism for verification and\nauthorization before you can give assets? So these are the areas that we\nlooked at, Paul. It\u0026rsquo;s interesting to see from different perspective, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 51:02\nYeah, I would think that can\u0026rsquo;t be easy, especially at a college level, to have\nto micro change or micro segment each of those pieces so that you keep\nthe students where they\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be and give the professors like\nyourself, the ability to control just like your.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 51:20\nLittle bits and trying to use because sometimes I try to look at it based on\ndifferent levels whereby we can use AWS as a vendor and use Azure as\nanother vendor and try to multi cloud them and see if you can still have\nthe same control. When you add just one vendor and you could see that it\u0026rsquo;s\nnot just that easy. No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 51:48\nYeah. When you start getting into multi cloud, especially college, I imagine\nthere isn\u0026rsquo;t like and I apologize, I didn\u0026rsquo;t catch the university. Which\nuniversity are you from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 51:59\nUniversity of Rohanson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 52:02\nSo it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty impressive university.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 52:04\nSorry, I have to drop off. So it was nice to meet you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaciej Owsiany - 52:08\nTill next meeting you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 52:10\nGabriel a good one, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s interesting because I would wagerly for\na university relatively well funded and I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine you don\u0026rsquo;t think so?\nOkay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 52:30\nNo, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work like that everywhere. It\u0026rsquo;s always constraints around\nthat. But at least I would assume that open source that you can use\naround and it makes life easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 52:49\nI think there\u0026rsquo;s a long discussion about how you guys are working, how the\nuniversity is working through that. I hear the pain in your voice about how\nyou\u0026rsquo;re implementing and it makes me sad. There\u0026rsquo;s got to be a better way\nto do that somehow, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is. I think you probably will\nhave to figure it out. But if there\u0026rsquo;s anything I can do to help, I\u0026rsquo;m happy to\nhelp out. But yeah, it sounds like it\u0026rsquo;s rough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 53:16\nMaybe if you think there are better ways of implementing that will help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 53:26\nYou would know better than I would. I mean, the reality of you being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 53:30\nOn remember, zero trust is what we are talking about. So no trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 53:34\nNo trust. Fair enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaciej Owsiany - 53:36\nNo trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel L. Manor - 53:37\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaciej Owsiany - 53:38\nI actually found it quite interesting how we started talking about the AI\nand obviously how this may actually make things more difficult in terms of\nverifying who\u0026rsquo;s actually who. And were actually talking about the AI and\nChat GPT just before we started recording a session. So it was quite\ninteresting how the conversation, what the conversation lead into. But\nanyway, yeah, it was good to be on the panel. Nice meeting you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOgechukwu Okonor - 54:10\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a pleasure. Bye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan Case - 54:12\nTo reach out if you\u0026rsquo;d like. I\u0026rsquo;ll see you guys later. Bye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:15\nTake care, guys.

Welcome to this open security summit session in April 23. Here we have\nMarco that we\u0026rsquo;re going to talk about zero Trust database access using\nOpen ZT and the PVC. Over to you Marco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 00:15\nThank you very much and welcome everybody to this small presentation.\nBasically the idea here is show you how you can start hub more control\nabout connectivity, how more control about security and basically start\naccessing the different assets in a securely fashioned way, right? In order\nto get started, I\u0026rsquo;m going to introduce myself. My name is Marco Shekman.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been over 15 years experience in basically cybersecurity most likely\nand on infrastructure. I\u0026rsquo;m super paranoid and I\u0026rsquo;m actually a video game\namateur player, right. I love playing StarCraft Overwatch, although I\u0026rsquo;m\nterrible playing, I do like it, right? Most likely right now I\u0026rsquo;m focusing on\nevangelist and basically everything related to sock building, zero Trust,\nOT security, IoT security, et cetera. Right? Let\u0026rsquo;s get started to this topic\nwhich is at least for me something really interesting in order to make it\nhappen, in order to get any idea of what we are going to discuss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 01:27\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see the regular basic deployment production we as a developer used\nto do for different companies, right? We do have basically what it\u0026rsquo;s called,\nour application. On top of the application, whatever we\u0026rsquo;re building on the\napplication, we always put our firewall and of course we can put also the\nweb application firewall, we can put the load balancing on top of it, right?\nAny other different things that we are basically those different layers that\nwe are using in order to make it secure. Right? What is the big problem\nabout this scope that we are basically regularly taking every single day?\nWell, we have our attackers, right? The attacker may try to reach out to\ndifferent services just basically using the gateway. The web application\nfirewall most likely will work using signatures. These guys are especially\nknown because they only find a way to basically avoid the signature that\nthere could be currently on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 02:29\nOf course we can basically exploit any zero day vulnerability that they can\nhave or they have discovered at that time, making it so difficult for us to\nbasically being able to protect effectively speaking or solutions or\napplication that we are actually exposing to everybody. Right? The future\nis scary, right. Day after day we find out that different breaches, different\nbasically vulnerabilities, different exploitation they\u0026rsquo;re currently doing. And\nyeah, that happened recently. People can actually get scared and people is\nactually getting still every single day it\u0026rsquo;s coming. Right? On the security\nperspective, that\u0026rsquo;s not the only thing to keep in mind, right? We as a\ndeveloper, so when we need to collaborate with somebody else, what is the\nother thing? We\u0026rsquo;re using VPN right? VPN, it\u0026rsquo;s coming with lots and lots of\nother issues, right. How to solve it. IP overlapping all the kind of stuff that\njust making it so complex to do, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 03:36\nFinally, as developers, you probably have heard not only as a developers,\nbut basically as every person probably have heard the lattice about the\nchain, right? How they can or how hackers attackers can actually get into\none company in order to basically being able to populate or to send their\nattacks to any others, right? The way they do it right now, the new target\nthey\u0026rsquo;re basically reaching out are basically the DevOps team, right?\nEverything related to the CI, CD tools, monitoring, data Warehouse\nConfiguration Manager, basically everything that the DevOps is using. It\u0026rsquo;s\na goal mining for the attacker because the attacker can just start\nembedding their own bad code on top of it to basically being able to\nspread their ransomware, right? So it\u0026rsquo;s hard. And what can we do about\nit? Well, in first place, we need to recognize what is the current model of\nthe networking that we are currently using, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 04:42\nThat is important in order to understand how can we avoid all this kind of\nstuff that probably may be happening right now. In the regular network,\nwhat we are going to have is or attacker, right? The attacker basically is\ngoing to have or it\u0026rsquo;s going to try to move laterally to any different servers,\nright? Probably the attacker is not going to be able to reach out or Castle\nor assets, right, in a direct way. What is going to try to do, or what the\nattacker is going to try to do? Well, basically he\u0026rsquo;s going to try to send\ncommunication to any other endpoint that may have that access, that may\nhave basically the keys of the kingdom, right? That\u0026rsquo;s the easy way they\ncan do it because basically they move from there and they can start right\nnow from this machine. They can just now move laterally and basically\nreach out any other service as they basically need, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 05:37\nThe first thing we need to do is first recognize that the perimeter has\nevolved, right? I recall when I start working in this basically space, right,\nwe used to say this is the physical perimeter, right. We used to protect our\ndata centers. That\u0026rsquo;s probably one of the reason that when you go to the\ndata center, you need to present any number of credentials and basically\nyou need any number of bureaucratic processes. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong,\nthose are perfectly fine. The only issue is that we recognize how to protect\nthem in a physical way, right. We move into the network and then we start\nsaying, okay, in order to protect the network, probably we need to put the\nfirewall in there and then probably web application firewall as well, and\nthe DMC, et cetera. Basically we are promoting this physical mode into\nour networking, creating these virtual barriers between each one of the\ndifferent stages of network, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 06:37\nHowever, right now we know that not necessarily the network is what we\nare working on, right? We also know that there is something else and this\nis the application, right? The Pandemics actually taught us those\ncompanies that probably were not ready at the beginning. The Pandemics\njust show us how we can actually start working anywhere, just using\napplications, right? Assess applications, just mobile applications,\nwhatever. Basically right now we cannot protect just basically physically,\nright? We cannot protect just using just a firewall. Because I\u0026rsquo;m working\nfrom home, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a firewall who can protect me. I can probably\nstart working from the beach or I can start working from a coffee shop, et\ncetera. There is not actually an easy way to identify right now what is the\nperimeter that is surrounding us, right? We need to recognize the new\nperimeter is the edge. It\u0026rsquo;s the application right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 07:37\nRight? This came with lots of benefits, right. When we start talking about\ndistinguish or basically acknowledge that the application is a real\nperimeter, well, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be able to create something that is called\nmicroparameters and that is going to help us because we are going to\nstart reducing the surface of attack that the attackers may have, right? We\nare going to dissolve legacy technology. VPNs for starting a couple of days\nago, the US government just released a new document about how to make\nit happen, right? Security by default is the new model, right? Trying to\ndissolve all these legacy technologies and be more aware of basically the\nnew time we are approaching to and we are living too, right? It\u0026rsquo;s also\ngoing to help us to basically do a breach mitigation, right? It is not the\nsame saying oh gosh, this ransomware has to spread across all our\ncomputers and servers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 08:42\nThey just say yeah, well, unfortunately we\u0026rsquo;re going to hit on just one\nserver, right. Because basically it cannot move laterally, right? Because we\nhave done this micro segmentation, we have done this microperimeter\nacross the different application, et cetera, et cetera. Basically this kind of\nstuff is not going to be catastrophic when we start doing that, right? That\nis an immediate benefit of just recognize that the application is the new\nedge and basically we need to start protecting around these applications,\nright? In order to do that and before getting into what is the CDBC and\nhow we can do it is important to understand what is Open City. Open City\nis just basically an overlay network. It\u0026rsquo;s an overlay network that is going\nto work on top of the Internet. What internet? Your internet? My internet.\nAnybody\u0026rsquo;s internet, right? The 5G, whatever, right. They\u0026rsquo;re not using or\nit\u0026rsquo;s not going to use any specifics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 09:39\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just only going to use the regular internet no matter where we\u0026rsquo;re\nlocated onto. Right? In order to protect this, we are going to start working\nwith different solution or with different sites or different parts of it. Right.\nThe first one is the controller. The controller, as you can imagine, the\ncontrol plane is the one that is going to authenticate us, is going to tell us\nif we are authorized to consume any different service that might be\nlocated on top of our overlay network. Right? On top of that we\u0026rsquo;re going\nto have the routers and we can say that we have two different type of\nrouters. The first router we are going to discover is this one which is the\nedge router and those routers are the only ones that are going to have a\npublic IP available. The reason behind that is that somebody or any other\ncustomers may be able to connect to those if the controller says that I can\nactually do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 10:39\nRight. Of course we\u0026rsquo;re going to have some other routers and those routers\nmight be on the fabric on their overlay network that we can start creating\nor at the same time they can be on somebody else, right. Where they can\nbe well they can be in our own infrastructure, it can be on the data center,\net cetera. The reason behind those routers is that they can work as a mesh\nhealing factory, right. When we start putting more and more routers we\nare going to find all this solution is going to find the closest path basically\nto that, right? Of course after we have our routers we are going to have\nfull mutual communication between each one of those, right? Finally of\ncourse we have the applications. The applications are going to have\ncompletely outbound communication to the public routers or the edge\nrouters that we are actually putting on top of it, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 11:37\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the way we\u0026rsquo;re going to have a full communication. Something to\nkeep in mind is that this information might be coming from the endpoint\nor might be coming from a full application that has communication to\neach other. Right. The beauty of this is because everything is outbound,\nthere is no single port I need to open on this side and there is not a single\nport I need to open on this side. Right. Everything could be and can be on\nclosest ports, right? No listening ports, nobody. The only one who is going\nto decide who can actually have access to consume this service or this\nservice that\u0026rsquo;s living here is the controller, right? The controller is going to\ntell me oh yeah, you can move on, oh no, you don\u0026rsquo;t even know what is this.\nRight? So there is no possibility. I can basically do expectation because\nthere is nothing that could be exposed for me in the first place, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 12:38\nJust for the static. With that we need to understand that this solution, open\nCity is going to provide us different way to access our applications. The\nfirst way is going to provide us is something that is called cDNA and\nbasically that\u0026rsquo;s the regular use case that probably most of us are used to,\nright? There is basically some kind of VPN site to site communication and\nbasically on the zero trust network access, what is going to happen is that\nwe\u0026rsquo;re going to have a router located in probably our data center and then\nwe\u0026rsquo;re going to have another router located probably in a cloud provider.\nWhat is going to happen is that I\u0026rsquo;m going to say all everything that is\ncoming from this router can be able to reach out everything that is located\ninto this other router, providing that probably all my users right in this\ndata center can actually have communication to all the services, all the\nhosts located on the OCI or the cloud provider or whatever is my cloud\nprovider location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 13:45\nRight. It is completely possible to do it. Of course we can also extend this\nmore what happened when I don\u0026rsquo;t want to allow that every single\ncustomer or every single my user may have access to the other side.\nProbably I just want to have one to one communication right from my own\ncomputer to basically the production server to the database, et cetera. So\nhow can I do it? How is that possible to do it? Well we can have something\ncalled Zero Trust host access and where basically we\u0026rsquo;re doing host access\nis that meaning that basically we\u0026rsquo;re going to install a tunnel or a client on\neach other site and basically we\u0026rsquo;re going to provide full communication\nbetween these two sites. Which means is that nobody internally is going to\nbe able to see the traffic because everything is going to be completely\nencrypted and of course we are going to reach out the other party in a\nsecure fashion way, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 14:44\nFinally you may say, what Marcus, if a hacker has control of my computer\nis going to be able to try to reach out anything else just trying to install\nany Rat application or that. Well you can have something else and you can\nhave an application embedded or something that is called Zero Trust\napplication access. What it means is that you can actually embed the SDK\nin the application on the client side or the server side and basically provide\nfull communication. No need at all to basically expose anything. No need\nat all that if I are ransomware connecting to my computer it\u0026rsquo;s not going to\nbe able to reach out anything else because the only one that has\nauthorization to communicate to probably the database is going to be my\nclient and that\u0026rsquo;s it. That\u0026rsquo;s the only way I can basically start doing that.\nThat it\u0026rsquo;s an easy way to basically provide security to our applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 15:44\nIf we already know what is the overlay and we already know that can help\nus. What are the superpowers or what are those powers that we can\nactually get when we start implementing basically Open City? Well, we\u0026rsquo;re\ngoing to start seeing it now. The first one is addressability. Basically you\u0026rsquo;re\ngoing to be in control of your own DNS and your own networking, right?\nThis is huge if you are providing like MSSP solutions or that. You know\nthat EIP Overlapping is constantly happening all the time, right? And it is\nnormal, right, I recall. Basically even when we do have a lot of segment or\nthe private segments in the IP, before space, we used to choose always the\ntimer, right? The 192, 168, ten one, or the 192, 168, 100 or the one 7216,\n16, et cetera. Right. It is always on regular speaking, it\u0026rsquo;s just the same\nnetworks, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 16:45\nSo IP Overlapping is constantly right. Well, Open City is going to allow us\nto basically move from that to create our own space. We can use any kind\nof IP addresses or we can just use a private DNS and start talking about\nwe are going to talk about the naming of the endpoints connecting to the\nservices. I do need to, right? In this particular case, I\u0026rsquo;m going to allow the\ncleaned workstation to communicate to the Jenkins service, not the Jenkins\nhost, right. He\u0026rsquo;s not going to have access to probably the SSH, just the\nJenkins service, right. And that\u0026rsquo;s it. Of course this implies that I can also\nchange the port, right? I can just decide that probably every single service\nis going to listen on the same port, the four, three or the port 80 or\nwhatever port are actually required to. That means that I can also start\nworking with security by obfuscation in this particular case and start\nconnecting to each one of those, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 17:47\nIt is not going to be super standard super compliance, but it\u0026rsquo;s going to\nhelp us to start protecting our solution. Keep in mind again, this is an\noverlay network, so I can modify every time I need to, right up embedded\non the server side. Yes, as you can imagine, that means that we can put\nsomething in front of our application, the SDK on top of the application,\nand basically no need to opening the port. Is that a Kubernetes application\nrunning in? Well, don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to expose it, right? You don\u0026rsquo;t\nneed to expose basically you don\u0026rsquo;t need to tell the cluster that you\u0026rsquo;re\nactually listening on something. Just basically you can use our solution to\nreach out the service completely in an automatic fashion way, right? This\nalso works because it\u0026rsquo;s going to be able to protect for basically anything. I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t know if you recall two years ago, the lot for Yay stuff, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 18:41\nIt was a big cows we need to patch at that time probably like three times\nbecause the first one was the current lot for yay, but then it had another\nvulnerability with a Dos and then another and another, et cetera. It was a\nmess, right? Well, what happened when the attacker can exploit that,\nespecially on a zero day, we don\u0026rsquo;t have time, right, or meantime to detect,\nbasically reduce a lot and we need to act faster. If we are putting our\nsolution on top of it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter that we actually have the vulnerability.\nOf course, we need to fix it as soon as possible, but we\u0026rsquo;re going to have\nmore time to basically do those changes to test if it\u0026rsquo;s not going to affect\nbecause basically only authorized services, only authorized identities are\ngoing to be able to reach out or solution or application and the attacker\nwho maybe is going to try once and whence and see if that happens, well,\nhe\u0026rsquo;s not going to be enrolled or he\u0026rsquo;s not going to be entitled to basically\nbeing able to reach out the service and access it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 19:46\nRight. Of course it means that we can also certify the client as well, right?\nBeing able to access different ways to the different services no matter\nwhere I located at on the browser, on an SQL client, et cetera, right? To\nbe honest, using the SDK, it\u0026rsquo;s super easy, like two or three lines easy, right?\nAs you can see on the screen right now, it\u0026rsquo;s just a job example, right?\nSuper simple. You can see this is the regular stuff we used to do, right? We\nbasically say I need to open a socket channel and basically I\u0026rsquo;m going to\nput the listening in this particular port, right, in this particular host that\nI\u0026rsquo;m getting it, right? I\u0026rsquo;m going to get and accept everything that I\u0026rsquo;m just\nbasically processing as I need to, right, the city way. Super easy, right?\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to initiate the communication, right? That\u0026rsquo;s basically us\ncommunicating with the controller and say, hey, can I raise a server, can I\nput this or that, et cetera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 20:53\nThat\u0026rsquo;s something, that\u0026rsquo;s the only thing that we\u0026rsquo;re going to do. After that\nwe\u0026rsquo;re going to say, what, I\u0026rsquo;m going to bind, but not on this particular IP or\nthis particular port, no, I\u0026rsquo;m going to bind with this service and that service\nis going to have its own information. That service probably is going to put\nme into the port 80 or the port 20 or the port whatever, right? It\u0026rsquo;s going to\ngive me some way to accessing it. I don\u0026rsquo;t know that at code time. That\u0026rsquo;s\nthe beauty because I don\u0026rsquo;t need to mess with it. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be super\nsecure and everything is going to work as expected, just as easy as that,\nright? Basically I don\u0026rsquo;t need to know the IP, I don\u0026rsquo;t need to know the port,\nI don\u0026rsquo;t need to know anything on this particular way. That means that it\u0026rsquo;s\ngoing to help us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 21:40\nBecause if you recall the original model of the network, what happened in\nthat the attacker may move laterally in order to access it. Because\nbasically he\u0026rsquo;s going to for the endpoint, he is going directly to try to put\nsomething in the endpoint so he can have access into. If I embedded the\napplication, that means that he should know how to accessing the\napplication. He should know how to basically start, but he cannot exploit\nbeyond that application because I have put everything on my own solution.\nBasically the attacker needs to know that the SCCP is only going to be\nable to send SSCP information. The SQL is only going to be able to send\nSQL information. If the hacker is trying to do basically an SQL and FTP\nor whatever in a different port as we configure, it\u0026rsquo;s going to be completely\nimpossible. That also means the solution that\u0026rsquo;s Nmap et cetera are not\ngoing to work because basically this is only entitled for the solution for the\napplication that we are just building at this particular moment, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 22:47\nThis is the beauty and of course we are talking about CDBC and this is\nmore likely for Java development, but guess what, you can basically use it\nanywhere. We have SDK and there is an SDK for basically anything that\ncould be used. This is the beauty of the open source as well, right? Being\nable to basically reuse the code and put it anywhere, develop once,\ndevelop anywhere, right? I don\u0026rsquo;t need to nail, I don\u0026rsquo;t need to mess with the\nnetworking anymore. It\u0026rsquo;s just as easy and that right. CDBC, let\u0026rsquo;s get into\nthe mode, let\u0026rsquo;s try to understand more on how this CDBC or what is and\nhow it works, right? At CDBC basically certifying CDBC well first, you\nalready know that JDBC, it\u0026rsquo;s the standard de facto to access any\ndatabase, right? It could be a relational databases, but basically any\ndatabases that could be self, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 23:49\nAt the same time, not that long ago a company found out that many\ndatabases contain vulnerabilities and this could be related to many things,\nright? First, obviously upgrades, updates, et cetera. Secondly, as we saw,\nright, basically the code we need to be the VBA, the developer, everyone,\nit\u0026rsquo;s trying to run with the business, right? It\u0026rsquo;s trying to move the business\nsaying we need to do this, we need to deliver this, we need to deliver that,\nand these are the dates. When the new vulnerability happens, well, it just\nput into the queue, right? It is hard, to be honest, it is hard to stay on top\nof the vulnerabilities and then of course to stay on top of releasing the new\nversion with the new features, et cetera, right? If you sum up that plus\n56% of the vulnerabilities on the databases are normally high or critical,\nwell, it trying to makes more sense, right, to defend or put the database\nprotected, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 24:51\nTrying to put it somewhere where the attacker cannot reach it out. Plus\nlet\u0026rsquo;s keep in mind that most of the cases the database is going to contain\ninformation from us, right? Information from customers. It is critical to\nhave that information secure, right? To have that asset completely\nprotected. So how we can do it? Well, basically there is a way to certify\nanything and that way you just start certifying the JDBC and certify the\nJDBC just basically say, what, we\u0026rsquo;re going to make that any JDBC\ncommunication, it can work using basically the overlay, right? And it was\nquite easily, right? It is super easy as you can see here. One of the ways\nyou can start doing it right before doing the CDBC for example, and it is\njust basically initialization of the SDK that is connecting with Open City\nand sometimes just modifying the socket sub factory that probably that\nparticular ddbc is using.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 25:54\nLike this one, right? You\u0026rsquo;re going to say, Marcos, that is only happening\ninto the code, right? How can I make it in for example, an SQL client?\nWell, using the CDBC it\u0026rsquo;s completely possible to do it. The only thing we\nneed to do is just tell right, or solution whatever it is that we are going to\nuse another driver. That\u0026rsquo;s the driver we\u0026rsquo;re going to put or driver. It\u0026rsquo;s only\ngoing to have one small modification, the first one, right? As you can see,\ninstead of starting our current URL with the JDBC that we currently know\nand then the completed URL et cetera, we\u0026rsquo;re to modify the JDBC. But just\nat C, right? CDBC, that\u0026rsquo;s going to be the new path, the new URL that\nwe\u0026rsquo;re going to use. Of course we\u0026rsquo;re going to use another some other\nproperties in order to make it happen. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use the city identity\nfile in order to make a what, you\u0026rsquo;re going to use this key and guess what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 26:54\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t want to send the key in plain text that I think nobody will\nwant you, right? You can also put it into a wallet and just make it happen.\nJust send the wallet and protect the wallet as you currently do right now,\nright? Protect it using the application server that you probably are using\nor protected in any different way, right? It\u0026rsquo;s super easy to basically just\nmake it happen and just get started with it, right? What are the goals of\nthis CDBC, right? Because you may thinking, oh man, you will need to\nmodify basically the application for one application for the postgres, for\nMySQL, for Maria, for whatever. Well, not necessarily, right? The first\ngoal is not modifying existing code driving, right? The reason behind that\nis because they have already invested so much time and so much resources\nto make it happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 27:48\nTo make that basically driver working in a way that is going to provide\nprobably more reliability and more performance. We don\u0026rsquo;t want to modify\nthose existing things, right? We just want to make it happen to use it as a\nbackbone. Basically we want to make it as simple for any customer\napplication and for basically any third party tools that could be embedded,\nright? I\u0026rsquo;m probably using DB Beaver to connect to my databases. I want\nto use it here, right? To make it simple to use anywhere, wherever it is,\nright? So how does it work then? What we did or what we are doing with\nCDBC is just basically a wrapper, right? What is going to happen on top of\nit is that we are going to deliver some shim configure and basically what is\ngoing to provide that is that it\u0026rsquo;s going to send us directly to the vendor\ndriver but using our solution as the transport to send that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 28:51\nBasically long story short is that we\u0026rsquo;re going to open a city socket right, to\nthe other party and the database is just basically just that city socket to\ncommunicate to the database in a secure way, in basically easy way. We\ndon\u0026rsquo;t need to modify anything, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to modify codes, we don\u0026rsquo;t\nneed to do anything else. Just adding our solution as it is. As we saw, the\nonly thing we need to modify is just the starting of the line just to put the\nC, it\u0026rsquo;s saying it\u0026rsquo;s using or stream or configuration in order to\ncommunicate to any database, right? Plain and simple. That\u0026rsquo;s it. It\u0026rsquo;s the\nonly thing it needs to be done. What is going to happen if we don\u0026rsquo;t have\nthe shame for it? Well, don\u0026rsquo;t worry. We have added into the solution,\nagain, a couple other options where you can basically do the rejection of\nthe stream in a possible way, in a way that basically is going to be\ncompletely possible to modify the platform and start using it for any other\ndriver that not necessarily can be available at this moment right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 30:08\nRight. Yes, it can be used anywhere else. You can use it on your clients but\nyou can probably using any kind of web application server and you\nprobably rely on the application server pool technology to create those\nthings. Not necessarily you want to put it or you want to make it or only\naccessible for the code, right? It is not going to be an application.\nProbably is your application that it could be located on the cloud\ncommunicating when your databases could be on prem or vice versa. The\ndatabase could be on any cloud provider and you need to have\ncommunication there. Well don\u0026rsquo;t worry, this can be done easily as well,\nright? You can just basically onboard the same CDBC in your application\nor web application server configuration and do the same, right? Just\nadding the new identities or adding the new properties. To that one to\nprovide that communication easily right at that moment, no issues at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 31:08\nRight? So let\u0026rsquo;s see a little demo. You can see, you can feel the platform,\nright? How it works, what it\u0026rsquo;s doing, et cetera. I\u0026rsquo;m going to stop the\nsharing right now. Well, I\u0026rsquo;m going to modify it . That what I\u0026rsquo;m sharing. I\u0026rsquo;m\njust going to show you of what I\u0026rsquo;m doing here, right? What I do have is\nthis is the solution. This is just basically the code, how I build it, right? You\nmay have an idea of what we\u0026rsquo;re going to present, but basically it\u0026rsquo;s first\nsimple, right? I do have this workstation that it\u0026rsquo;s called Apollo. This\nworkstation have access to different things for the database or for the\ncommunication. We have created also one database server that is located\nin Europe, right, in a London data center. And we also have a US one.\nThis is located at New York without a center. So I do basically have\ndifferent solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 32:03\nRight now I\u0026rsquo;m located at Charlotte, right, on North Carolina. Basically I\ndon\u0026rsquo;t have access to any of those. At the same time, we do have an\napplication. This application is basically using a Python code, right? You\nwill see different things, how this basically is working, or what we can\nactually achieve on this, right? Let\u0026rsquo;s get started and let\u0026rsquo;s see how it\nworking, right? The first one, as you will see, is I\u0026rsquo;m going to do basically\njust a single sh. This SSH is going to be sended basically to the\napplication, right? I think it is okay. It was frozen for a bit. I\u0026rsquo;m going to do\nan SSH to that particular server, right? You can see here I\u0026rsquo;m connecting\nbasically to the US database, right? I\u0026rsquo;m just going to do you I\u0026rsquo;m going to\nuse SSH, and the idea behind that is that I should be able to basically\nreach out this server in an easy fashion way and connect to that, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 33:05\nYou can see here, I do have the access. This has obviously an external IP\naddress as well where I can communicate with it. Basically I\u0026rsquo;m just in that\nserver, right? Nothing fancy at this moment, just easy as that. To know\nthat we are not doing like anything crazy, I\u0026rsquo;m going to connect also to the\nEuropean SQL Server, right? Basically the idea is that you can see that I\nhave access to both of them. They are located in two different locations,\nright? They do have two different IP addresses. Basically I can just do the\ncurl and you can see again, this is a completely different address where we\nare located and how I access these servers. Well, basically I did access\nthose servers because my application is having access to those. If you take\na look into this, you can see that actually I\u0026rsquo;m providing the access to this\nparticular server via IP address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 34:05\nI define this particular IP address for it even when as you can see, this one\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t have any 172 IP, right? This is the 1066 and probably this is one\nother IP. There we go. Yes, different IP is located completely different.\nBasically as you can see, I\u0026rsquo;m just locating or I can have access to it in any\nfashion way I do want to, right? Not just that you are going to be able to\nsee it also that I do have access to different services in some other way.\nThere is only one port I can access to this and this is the port 22 and\nactually it makes sense if I disconnect from the SSH and I just say, what, I\nwant to do a Cellnet to the Postgres database, right, and Postgres is\nlistening in the 5432, right? I can use that and just say what, send me a\nCellnet on this, on the 5432.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 35:00\nWhat is going to happen is that as you can see my machine doesn\u0026rsquo;t have\naccess to that one, right? It is impossible to basically communicate to that\nbecause the agent policy or the policy that was deployed on top of here is\njust basically to provide communication to SSH, right? We are doing\nsegregation, it is not possible to do it. Actually you can see that the\nresolution is not even close to the IPS that this server may contain. Right?\nNow you may wondering, okay Marcus, so you just prove that you have\nSSH access. How can I connect? Well, the easiest way to connect is using\nor client. This client. This is SQL, right? Nothing crazy. You can see that\nbasically I do have here configure the Postgres data driver and in the\nPostgres driver you\u0026rsquo;re seeing that basically for the driver class path I\u0026rsquo;m\njust using the Postgres, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 35:56\nNothing else, it\u0026rsquo;s just the Postgres driver but I\u0026rsquo;m also using the CDBC,\nright? The CDBC is located on the Open City project on GitHub at open\nsource Apache two license. Basically you can use it anywhere you want.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m telling is, what, the class name to provide this driver into\nPostgres is going to be the City driver that we just created and the URL is\ngoing to be modified by CDBC or JDBC city Postgres. Right, so that\u0026rsquo;s it. I\ndo have a couple of aliases you can see here, right? I can modify this alias\nso you can have an idea what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. Basically you can see in here that\nI\u0026rsquo;m connecting using City to this same IP or same name with the port that\nI basically test that I don\u0026rsquo;t have the access to communicate to, right? I can\njust say, what, connect me to the US database and what is going to\nhappen is that the application is going to have the solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 37:00\nIt\u0026rsquo;s going to have the proper requirement authorization to communicate to\nthis particular server. In here, well, you can see, right, basically I can just\nshow information, I can just show any tables, right? I can just basically do\nwhatever I want and I can see the content on it, right? I\u0026rsquo;m working on the\nSQL database and my server, my workstation don\u0026rsquo;t have access to it.\nWhatever else I try to use is not going to work. This works using a domain\nas we did in here. It\u0026rsquo;s also working if I use an IP, which IP, the IP that I\nbasically and explicitly select, that I can use to connect. You can see this is\nthe same database, but in this particular case I want to reach it out just\nusing the IP address. Once again, I\u0026rsquo;m going to use this internal IP address\nand I have exactly the same information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 37:57\nI am connected to the same server, running on the same deviant device\nand running everywhere, right? Basically I do have the possibility to just\ncommunicate anywhere else, right, in just using the CDBC driver that we\nare setting up here, right? As you can see, this is huge because it will allow\nyou not only to provide a secure access to your developers, to UDBA, but\nalso eventually to provide a more secure access to the application by itself,\nright? Any robot code exception or any robot code injection that they may\nhave and they probably will win access to the application server. Well, it\ndoesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, right? The server is not going to be able to move laterally.\nThe application will, but not the server by itself. We are reducing basically\na scope of the surface of attacks, the surface of the threat. It\u0026rsquo;s getting\nreduced and reduced even more and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 38:58\nJust a couple of other examples to show you, right? I\u0026rsquo;m going to show you\nanother one that I completely like. This is because the power of basically\nthis SDK that you can integrate, we focus on the CDBC, of course, but\nCDBC, it is just one of the different applications that you can do with\nOpen City, right? The other ones are, for example, putting a server running\nbehind the scenes, right? In this particular server, right, you will see this is\nthe server again, right? You can see all these IP addresses. You can see\nwhat is the external IP address that got assigned to it. In this particular\nserver, I do have a docker for a container that is running and you can see\nthat this container is not having any port available. Actually if I try to\nreach out this particular server, I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to reach it out in here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 39:55\nYou can see that actually I\u0026rsquo;m not able to, right? This is the way I want to\naccess it and basically I don\u0026rsquo;t have access to it. However, we\u0026rsquo;re going to\nconnect to the server right to the docker. Obviously I know I\u0026rsquo;m not\nfollowing docker interfaces or docker best practices to the provided right?\nThe idea is that you can see when I try to run my application and I\u0026rsquo;m just\ngoing to say what, raise this server. This is going to be a flask regular\napplication and you need to use this internal service. This service is just\nbasically a service I just created into Open City, right? This is a service\nthat is going to provide us communication, it\u0026rsquo;s a web application\ncommunication but it\u0026rsquo;s only listening into the overlay network. What is\ngoing to happen is that after I just did that I basically have access to\naccess the solution in this fashion way and of course this will work if I\nwant to send information just using postman or any information I will\nwant to send is going to be able to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 41:03\nThe reason behind that is because we do have the ability to basically\nembed on top of the different application as I want to. Finally even one\nmore solution you can provide you\u0026rsquo;re using Open City. I know, right? I love\nit. It is a great open source solution basically. The other thing you can do\nis basically start sharing, right? How many times you need to share your\nbasically space on a document or basically any kind of service to\nsomebody else and you are using basically any probably free solution on\nthe top to share the file or to share the service, right? How many times?\nProbably a little bit right of those. Well, Open City, right, thanks to the\nSDK and thanks to many other things, you can also create this type of\nsharing tools and in this particular case I\u0026rsquo;m going to share with you one\nsimple sharing tool that has been built on top of Open City as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 42:00\nThis sharing tool is called the Syrac. Basically what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do is I\nhave put a server right, and you can see if I go to Croc test, right? There\nyou go. There is here a couple of files that I want to share with you. All\nright? Those files, it\u0026rsquo;s an easy way to share it. How can I share it with\neverybody? Well, I can just basically say Sirok, what, Open City I want to\nshare in a public way this directory, right? I want to do it using a web\napplication. This is basically what we\u0026rsquo;re going to show you and what is\ngoing to happen is that I do have this query or I do have this URL that I\ncan basically access at any moment. Basically what is going to happen is\nthat right now if you\u0026rsquo;re typing it now you\u0026rsquo;re going to be able to reach out\nmy computer and have access to these two files, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 43:01\nWe can show you that basically I can just say that it\u0026rsquo;s working. He\u0026rsquo;s going\nto send me the file that I just select. So basically this is just working, right?\nIt is just showing you just a single file. Of course, at the moment I decide\nthat you are no longer have access to it, I can just click it, close it and\nthere you go. It\u0026rsquo;s going to have full or I\u0026rsquo;m going to lose communication to\nit because it\u0026rsquo;s no longer going to be working. Right. I can just take it\nanywhere else, any other basically a browser that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have like the\ncache enabled, right? We can just open a private session. What is going to\nhappen is just that right? It\u0026rsquo;s just going to remove all communication that\nyou used to have on it, right? Because there is no more access to it, I just\nclose it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 43:50\nRight. Providing that basically you have full communication and you have\nfull access to anything you want to share. Right. In conclusion, to have\nsome time for probably some other questions, let\u0026rsquo;s keep in mind what we\ncan basically do it, right? How to get Open City or what we need to. Oh, I\nthink there we go. Yeah, I messed it up. I just double click. All right, we are\ngoing to share it again. So, yeah, in conclusion, what I highly recommend\nis just getting Open City. It\u0026rsquo;s open source, it\u0026rsquo;s going to help you and there\u0026rsquo;s\nmany ways to basically get it right. You can go to GitHub, just download\nit, you can go to City Dev and start working with it. We have multiple\noptions. We do have the quick start. You can just put any Open City in\nthere, right? As you can just launch it, create your own network, start\nsharing whatever you want to, whatever you need to as you did, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 44:53\nStart moving with the servers, start moving to databases, start moving for\nbasically anything you want to. Right? So, yeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if there is\nany questions for the public right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 45:05\nYeah, look, this is pretty awesome, right? I have to say I wasn\u0026rsquo;t fully aware\nof this tool. Now I have tons of questions. Can we start with the last\nexample? Right, so you\u0026rsquo;re sharing some files, right, from your one service\nI\u0026rsquo;ve used in the past is a service called Ngrok, if you know that. So is this\nkind of equivalent. So what\u0026rsquo;s the requirement? You need to have an agent\non your computer, which is the almost like the routing the local traffic\nrouter, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 45:37\nWell, not really. And that is the beauty. Right. The solution can work with\nagents or without agents. For example, I\u0026rsquo;m going to shoot down all my\nagents here, right? What is going to happen as long as I do that is that let\nme close this . My machine just got slow. So what is going to happen? You\ncan see right now, right? I just got me disconnected from the server, right.\nI no longer have access to any SSH, basically. The reason I no longer have\naccess to it is because I should down the client, right. You can see it did\nconnect me, right, completely disconnected. So I don\u0026rsquo;t have the access.\nStill, if I run it this is quite similar to Angry, as you said, right? The\ndifference is Angry is just a public available service that you use, not open\nsource. In here you can mount your own instance of similar scroc, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 46:33\nI can just click it, I can just share it again, right? As you saw, I shoot down\nmy agent. The agent is not working. If you access this right, I\u0026rsquo;m going to\nput it in the chat. Bear with me because it\u0026rsquo;s a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 46:50\nBit slow from a technical point of view. What this is doing is your\ncontainer is sending the traffic to well, that tool you built, right? This\nparticular one is sending the traffic to the exposed service, right? Like you\nsaid, we can run our own or we can run a managed service on top of it,\nright?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 47:11\nThat is correct, yes. So basically you have that ability. My computer is\ngoing to send the traffic or everything is going to be using that. I don\u0026rsquo;t\nneed to open any port, right? I don\u0026rsquo;t need to expose it, nothing. I can just\nshare that URL or any URL that the system is going to provide me at that\nmoment and I can just share it with you. I can just share it with anyone\nand they can start accessing to it. I just finished the share, I just closed the\nshare and nobody else is going to be able to access it, right? Particularly\nfor the syrup, I think somebody else in some other session they\u0026rsquo;re going to\ntalk about it, but we can discuss mods in different ways. Basically for the\nSyria perspective, you can also share it in a private way and just say, what,\nthis is going to be shared, but only those that are actually part of my\noverlay network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 47:58\nNot necessarily publicly explicit, but it\u0026rsquo;s only private, basically network.\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 48:05\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the kind of policies I think I saw you mentioned, right, that you can\napply almost point to point policies based on application, right, based on\nidentity and that kind of stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 48:15\nThat is correct. Because this is an overlay. Everything is going to become\nan endpoint, right. Remember, we\u0026rsquo;re telling or we\u0026rsquo;re trying to move this\nconcept that the endpoint is just a computer right now, or Endpoint or\nEdge is just an application. Right now we\u0026rsquo;re saying this application can\nconnect to the SQL. Any other application running on my machine can\u0026rsquo;t,\nright? For example, you saw that I shoot down the tunnel, right? My\ntunnel is no longer working and I don\u0026rsquo;t have access to the databases,\nright. If I want to have access to the database located somewhere into the\nUS, for example, this database, I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to connect. The reason behind\nthat I\u0026rsquo;m able to connect is because my machine can\u0026rsquo;t. But this scroll\ndatabase, right. Client, this one can. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:05\nIt correct to say that one of the advantages of the agent is that it will\nprobably require in some cases less changes, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 49:15\nThat is correct. You have the ability to basically communicate to anything\nyou want to, right. You have the ability to put the agent and the agent is\ngoing to provide the full access to your computer. But you can just certify\nthat. It\u0026rsquo;s the word that we are using. Basically when you certify that you\nare able to just provide the access to that specific application, you may\nwant to yeah, cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 49:39\nIn terms of the server side, what you\u0026rsquo;re creating is almost a mesh network,\nright, with the agents that get installed, the server instances, right. And\nthen is that correct to say? For example, on the other end you have a\nbunch of those deployments and they now know how to communicate\nthemselves so that they can find the right basically target that you want to\ncommunicate. You build a kind of a custom DNS almost like\ninfrastructure on top so you can find things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 50:10\nThat is correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:11\nYeah, I\u0026rsquo;m just trying to get my head around it, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 50:16\nYeah. And you can put anything right. You can create your own DNS\nspace. I\u0026rsquo;m using my own personal DNS, but basically you can just avoid\nDNS. Probably you just want to say, hey, I want that squirrel can\ncommunicate with, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, postgres DB one. Right. You\u0026rsquo;re not\nputting any DNS, it\u0026rsquo;s just naming convention that you\u0026rsquo;re using. Or\nprobably you want to recreate your own basically networking, right. You\nwork for many other companies and this is going to help you to flat that\nnetwork as well, but also.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 50:46\nTo completely protect it. Right. Because for example, at the moment with\nVPNs you have to give access to a huge amount of stuff, right. With this\nyou almost create connections right, based on what we want a particular\nservice or user to access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 51:01\nThat is correct. Basically you just provide the access to those specific\nservices. Right. I don\u0026rsquo;t want you to have access to the whole server. The\nonly thing you may have access is to the SQL, right, to the postgres\nbecause you\u0026rsquo;re the DBA, but you don\u0026rsquo;t have to connect via SSH, it\u0026rsquo;s just\nDBA, that\u0026rsquo;s it. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to give you access to your computer just to\nthe application you\u0026rsquo;re using, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 51:24\nYeah. Have you had use cases where you actually use this, for example,\ninside a Kubernetes cluster to lock down access? Even within the cluster\nyou can of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 51:34\nCourse you can do micro segmentation. You can actually allow some\nspecific services running on the cluster, you can actually allow that some\nspecific containers or some specific application running on the cluster may\nhave communication externally as well. Of course, if you are talking about\nKubernetes, you can also say, what, I want to manage my Kubernetes\ncluster without exposing any public IP and only the administrator\nKubernetes can connect to it. Right. And yeah, that is an opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 52:06\nIn that case, why are you installing the cluster? Are you installing a server\nor the client?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 52:12\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a good one. From the cluster perspective, you have the ability to\nuse all helm charts. Using the helm charts, you can basically install some\nother application running the cluster that is going to work as the bridge.\nRight. That is going to provide basically that communication being quite\nsimplistic right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 52:31\nJust to clarify, so by bridge you means I could call a server, right? Like the\nserver unit. Okay. Let\u0026rsquo;s say if I have two complete separate clusters and\nthen a server somewhere else, what you\u0026rsquo;re calling Bridge is almost the\nservice that runs on each of those to allow them to communicate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 52:50\nThat is correct. If I do have two different clusters, I can make them\ncommunicate to each other. If I do have an application running on this\ncluster that needs to have communication to this database living on any\ncloud provider, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to create any VPN in there, I can also put\nit in there. Right. I can just put the application running in the cluster as\nwell. They may have communication to the database. No code\nmodification, no age installation, basically directly on top of the\nKubernetes as well. Basically you have the ability to put it anywhere, right.\nAny to any yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 53:23\nIt just to make sure that those bridges can talk to each other, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 53:27\nThat is correct. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 53:32\nI\u0026rsquo;m assuming that the bridge is then where we can serve authentication or\neven like all sorts of key based authentication. That connection between\nbridge to bridge is actually quite secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 53:48\nThat is correct. All communication is going to be completely secure. Right.\nYou can work with Mitchell TLS. We also work internally with the Chacha\npoly. Of course, you also have the ability to for the end users, you may say,\nwhat, if Marcus wants to connect there, not only he\u0026rsquo;s going to use his\nstrong identity, but also he needs to use probably an MFA right. Of his\nidentity might be on any basically a smart card or any strong identity\nsolution that I may want to use. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 54:26\nYeah. That was my next set of questions in terms of client identity. Right.\nWhat do you support in terms of identifying the user, the network that you\nin, the device that you\u0026rsquo;re in, what\u0026rsquo;s the options there? So this is from the\nclient, right. That talks to the bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 54:48\nThat is correct. From the client perspective, you have the ability to put\nbasically MFA any TOTP solution that you want to start working on it. He\ncan basically use it and because it use that specific you can basically put\nthe identity into any hardware piece. Right. I don\u0026rsquo;t know, HSMA I think it\nis called. Right. In English the acronym but basically smart card, GV key,\nwhatever. Right. You can just put your identity there and you can just plug\nit into the computer and if you have declined you may be able to connect.\nRight. So basically the hardware works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 55:27\nYeah. Really cool. No, I see tons of really powerful adoption. I think it\u0026rsquo;s\nreally great that you guys build it on top of an open source because it\nallows a lot of more flexibility on the deployments and then providing\ncommercial service on top of it. I think it allows for wider adoptions in\nplaces where sometimes you cannot have connections to the outside world\nor you only want to have specific points that connect to the outside world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 55:55\nThat is correct. Yeah, that was basically the idea to make it completely\nopen source. Right. It\u0026rsquo;s an open source project and I invite you to use it\nright. To start testing it to fork the repository, to basically download it or\njust use it for your own purposes. Right. Like I said, I\u0026rsquo;m super paranoic\nand I used to have these droplets located in the cloud, different ones. The\nway I used to access those was basically using VPNs and to open the VPN\nto those I was using like pornoking. Because super paranoid right now is\nlike I just connect to my client and I can reach out any server, whatever I\nneed to deploy it in an easy secure way. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 56:41\nLet me say I could deploy this on native instance, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 56:47\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 56:47\nNow it comes my bridge using a terminology and then that could be the\nonly thing that gets exposed to the outside world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 56:56\nThat is correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 56:57\nThat means apart from public services, okay. Something we expose here\nand there, website, we publish everything else. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like we can\ncreate a jump box with this. Right? I was going to say a much nicer jump\nbox. Right. Because usually jump is just a freaking SSL SSH proxy. You\njump into it and you go in there. This seems to me like it\u0026rsquo;s a gem box. I\nguess in that case you then have policies that you can apply to. Right. It\u0026rsquo;s\nalmost like you have a gem box but that could be connected to another\none that gives them the policy. How do you manage that? Distribution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 57:38\nThat\u0026rsquo;s correct. Yes, that is the perfect example. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t say it better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 57:43\nYes, very cool. No, I think it would be really cool to do it\u0026rsquo;s. Such a\npowerful concept. I really like as a good example of zero trust networks.\nRight. It seems that this is hitting a lot of those key elements. Right.\nBecause you now have conditional access based on who you are, what you\nare, what you want to access. What I really like is the ability to almost\nstart to create a nice segmented, zero trust access. Right? If an app can\nonly connect to X resources, that\u0026rsquo;s the only thing you should be able to\naccess, right? In terms of DevOps kind of this thing, right. In terms of\npipelines, what examples have you seen where let\u0026rsquo;s say that the definition\nof what needs to be accessed is actually on a repo, right? I\u0026rsquo;m just thinking\nin terms of scalability. For example, you have the helm charts that already\ndefine the ports that are open and all that jazz, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 58:50\nHow is the logic then that you would configure that and then as you\ndeploy the application will configure what\u0026rsquo;s required for the access. Is that\nthe logic?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 59:04\nThat is quite the logic. Basically we do have, in terms of perspective, we\ndo have everything ready so you can start using in the CI CD pipeline,\nright. A communication to the different artifacts that you can probably\nuse. We also have the home charts that you can basically deploy and start\nmaking it ready to start communicating your solutions. We do have also\nTerraForm ways you can start doing it. On the open city site, if you go to\ncity dev, you also will going to find Kubernetes cluster ready. You can even\ndeploy the solution on top of a Kubernetes cluster and just making it\nhappen. Right. We have lots of examples where you can start basically\nusing it. We have CDFI also Kubectl, right. If you need to manage basically\nyour Kubernetes cluster, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to install any agent. You can\nbasically just use Kubectl solution, your identity, do that and start\nmanaging the cluster as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 01:00:12\nBasically it has all the tools already ready so you can start working with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:00:19\nCool, man. This is really good because I think it\u0026rsquo;s a great implementation.\nI can see lots of really tough use cases. Let\u0026rsquo;s do a couple more sessions\nand I can totally see the value of and the solutions you\u0026rsquo;re solving. Right.\nSo really cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 01:00:45\nYeah. I invite everybody to connect to fork it, use it, and giving us a star as\nwell. Right? If you like the project, if you trust the project, just giving us a\nstar that is going to encourage us to keep moving and keep working on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:01:02\nWhere are you guys based? Where is everything based?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 01:01:04\nCompany is based basically in North Carolina, although we are working\nacross the world, basically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinis Cruz - 01:01:11\nYeah. Cool. All right, man, look brilliant. Thanks a lot for doing this\nsession and I look forward to seeing you on the next one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcos Schejtman - 01:01:19\nOf course, will be my pleasure. Thank you everybody for your time. I\u0026rsquo;ll see\nyou next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"sessions/2023/mini-summits/Apr/DevSecOps/","event":"mini-summit","expirydate":-62135596800,"facebook":null,"fuzzywordcount":10400,"hey_summit":"https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZcpduyvqD8pG9wxMb4TNIDS9oAuuGMJTK5g","image":null,"job_title":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752075784,"layout":"","linkedin":null,"notes":null,"objectID":"e48a2186b92551589536a9a04f917bfd","organizers":["Marcos Schejtman"],"permalink":"https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/zero-trust-database-access-using-openziti-and-jdbc/","project":"DevSecOps","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":49,"relpermalink":"/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/zero-trust-database-access-using-openziti-and-jdbc/","section":"sessions","status":null,"summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"about-the-session\"\u003eAbout the session:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecuring your database is incredibly important and easy to get wrong.
