&lt;p>Pyroscope is an open source continuous profiling platform. It allows you to profile applications 24/7 in production environments and find performance issues down to a single line of code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this session we&amp;rsquo;re gonna go over the internals of Pyroscope storage engine and how we are able to store data efficiently and also talk about how pyroscope can be useful for various use cases.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Schrems II - Transfer risk triage and other adventures in scoping</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/schrems-ii/schrems-ii---transfer-risk-triage-and-other-adventures-in-scoping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/schrems-ii/schrems-ii---transfer-risk-triage-and-other-adventures-in-scoping/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-talk">About this talk:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A robust data protection or cybersecurity risk assessment is a specialist undertaking. Specialists are in short supply.
If your assessment target handles very little data and can be down for a month, how serious can a broken control really be?
You cannot pen test everything. Not every vulnerability is an intolerable risk. Thatâ€™s where Sustainable Risk Triage (SRT) can come in.
Oversimplification gifted us a thousand tick-box compliance memes and arbitrary scoping decisions, often just based on spend.
Starting at the top of a testing to-do list and just working downwards. Burn out, incidents, and audit points, because time and money ran out.
This session is about a middle way. Standardizing and simplifying conversations about achievable work and risk.
Creating a defensible justification for de-scoping or deferral. Building hooks into next steps.
Linking to available resource Whether for Schrems II, 3rd party assessment, or applying a better quality risk lens to vulnerability reports,
this session will look at how SRT works and how it could be tailored for different purposes&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SDA SE Cluster Scanner is going Open Source</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/da-se-cluster-scanner-is-going-open-source/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/da-se-cluster-scanner-is-going-open-source/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Cluster Scanner detects images in Kubernetes clusters and provides fast feedback based on security scans.
As a developer, the Cluster Scanner works out of the box. As a system operator, I just add the Cluster Scanner in my deployment configuration, for example ArgoCD.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>History, DevSecOps journey, use cases, architecture and the different security scans of the Cluster Scanner will be described. Feedback from you is very welcome in this talk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Secure By Scenario</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/secure-by-scenario/secure-by-scenario/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/secure-by-scenario/secure-by-scenario/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2></description></item><item><title>Spreading security across the SDLC (with semgrep and other tools)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/spreading-security-across-the-sdlc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/mar/devsecops/spreading-security-across-the-sdlc/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2></description></item></channel></rss>
