This talk is an update on progress with mapping controls from CSA, CIS, OWASP and ISO to reduce the need for custom controls for the media &amp;amp; entertainment supply chain and to make it easy for smaller vendors to improve their security while keeping up to date with the latest best practice and responding to the latest threats</description></item><item><title>DSOMM News and Belts-Workshop</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/devsecops/dsomm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/devsecops/dsomm/</guid><description>About this session Some updates regarding the application will be disscussed.

Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s SDLC, OWASP SAMM, BSIMM, and more recently NIST, have threat modeling as a foundation stone in the SDLC which will help in finding vulnerabilities and preventing their exploitation by taking the perspective of an attacker. &amp;ldquo;Think like an attacker&amp;rdquo; is easier said than done. Practitioners come to Cybersecurity from different backgrounds: development, system or network administration, compliance, pentesting, and many others.</description></item><item><title>New OSS Projects</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/new-oss-projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/new-oss-projects/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>OSS DevSecOps projet</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/devsecops-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/devsecops-project/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>OSS OWASP Project</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/owasp-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/owasp-project/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>OSS Semgrep project</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/semgrep-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/semgrep-project/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>OSS Threat Modeling and Moldable Development Projects</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/threat-modeling-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/oss/threat-modeling-project/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Security-Scan your production images</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/devsecops/clusterscanner-demonstration.md/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/sep/devsecops/clusterscanner-demonstration.md/</guid><description>About this session The ClusterScanner detects images in Kubernetes clusters and provides fast feedback based on security scans.
It is recommended to run the Cluster Scanner in production environments.
As a developer, the ClusterScanner works out of the box.
As a system operator, I just have to add the Cluster Scanner in my deployment configuration, for example Argo CD. The benefit is to get feedback on what is in production and not what should be in production.</description></item></channel></rss>
