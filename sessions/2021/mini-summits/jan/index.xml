&lt;p>To find our more about how we are going to run this project, you can read this blog to get a view of our approach, as we explain it in our drive to find new talent to onboard and join for the project: &lt;a href="https://medium.com/glasswall-engineering/were-hiring-any-security-and-compliance-people-out-there-to-help-us-achieve-soc-2-and-then-some-10e0d15571fc">https://medium.com/glasswall-engineering/were-hiring-any-security-and-compliance-people-out-there-to-help-us-achieve-soc-2-and-then-some-10e0d15571fc&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>SOC 2 Criterias and Controls are represented in Jira - and linked - so we have a graph behind the scences&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jupyter notebooks are generating reports based on all Jira issues&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Google sheets and slides are generated from report data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All work we do, all callatoral we create, all process documentation and evidence requirements will be linked to all controls on Jira&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We want to scale this&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We want to automate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We want continuous compliance&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>CDR Engine Standard (Part 2)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/cdr/cdr-engine-standard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/cdr/cdr-engine-standard/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>CDR (Content Disarm and Reconstruction) is a new technology and
there isn&amp;rsquo;t a good way to differentiate between the capabilities
of the multiple engines (across file types)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This session aims to kickstart the process of creating such standard.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Owasp can help Security Teams - DevSecOps</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/owasp/how-owasp-can-help-devsecops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/owasp/how-owasp-can-help-devsecops/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>In security, ‘variant analysis’ is the process of searching for variants of known vulnerabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This used to be done with grep and painstaking manual code audits, but it can be automated with a
powerful semantic query language like CodeQL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will show how we performed a variant analysis using CodeQL which started analyzing a vulnerability
in Nexus Repository Manager and ended up finding many other critical vulnerabilities including a
Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Germany&amp;rsquo;s Corona-Warn-App (German&amp;rsquo;s Contact tracing app).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Maturity Mapping: Contextualise change and learning</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/wardley-maps/maturity-mapping-contextualise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/wardley-maps/maturity-mapping-contextualise/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2></description></item><item><title>Remote Threat Modeling</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/threat-modeling/remote-threat-modeling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jan/threat-modeling/remote-threat-modeling/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) are special types of programming languages for specific needs. For example, SQL is a DSL for relational database queries, and YAML is a DSL for text file formats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why I think that using a DSL is one of the best ways to write and automate tests. This talk is meant to be a &amp;ldquo;think big&amp;rdquo; talk rather than a technical demonstration. I&amp;rsquo;ll share the story of how I came to this conclusion, using real examples to illustrate the lessons learned in creating and using DSLs. I&amp;rsquo;ll also show how to use existing DSLs like Gherkin to write security tests.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
