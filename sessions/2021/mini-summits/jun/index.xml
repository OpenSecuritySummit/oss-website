&lt;p>If we can build software in a reliable, reproducible and quick way at any time using Pipeline-as-Code and have also automated security scans as part of it, how can we quickly capture the risk landscape of agile projects to ensure we didn’t miss anything important? Traditionally, this happens in workshops with lots of discussion and model work on the whiteboard with boxes, lines, and clouds. It’s just a pity that in some agile projects it stops there: Instead of a living model, a slowly but surely eroding artifact is created, while the agile project evolves at a faster pace. In order to counteract this process of decay, something has to be done continuously, something like “Threat-Model-as-Code” in the DevSecOps sense. See in this talk the ideas behind this approach: Agile developer-friendly threat modeling right from within the IDE using open-source tools. Models editable in developer IDEs and diffable in Git, which automatically derive risks including graphical diagrams and report generation with recommended mitigation actions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ASVS User Stories creation</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/owasp/asvs-user-stories-creation---part-5/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/owasp/asvs-user-stories-creation---part-5/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is quickly becoming one of the messiest IT landscapes around. Why? Because the IT industry&amp;rsquo;s supercharged development capabilities far outpace regulatory bodies&amp;rsquo; ability to set boundaries and minimal security requirements. In the meantime, a few organizations have put forth recommendations, but not everyone follows them, and sometimes it gets lost in translation. As such we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at various regulations and recommendations, and then see where some of what exists on the market today is lagging behind&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reciprocity: Tales of an Anthropologist in Cybersecurity</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/reciprocity-why-the-cybersecurity-industry-needs-more-anthropologists/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/reciprocity-why-the-cybersecurity-industry-needs-more-anthropologists/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this 1 hour session Lianne will discuss:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By 2025 it is estimated $10.5 trillion will be lost to cyber criminals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hacking humans is a very lucrative business. Social engineering is one of the easiest and most effective ways to access a secure system. Cyber criminals know this, and they are increasingly leaning on the research and techniques of the social science disciplines to leverage the human element into letting them into our lives, our businesses and our bank accounts. Yet, while the security industry is always striving to be ‘one step ahead’ of the criminals in terms of technical capabilities, it often neglects the need to consider the very social nature of hacking.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rules &amp; Recommendations: Are we pushing our new IoT device out correctly?</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/rules--recommendations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/rules--recommendations/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A tabletop-esque interactive session pitting 2-3 groups against one another.
Whether you are in the IT &amp;amp; production department, among the executives or a part of the regulatory bodies, your job is to determine how to move forward to ship a new IoT product rapidly and securely, without awaking the regulatory bodies&amp;rsquo; wrath.
Bring your party forward along the allotted timeline and influence other parties decisions in order to ship your product in time. But your actions and mitigations might fail, because you may fall prey to the cast of the die! You may have to sacrifice things in order to recoup development time, and this may lead to problems.
Can you bring the project to fruition? Or will you be making sure it never sees the light of day?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scaling Kubernetes - One Pod per file</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/scaling-kubernetes---one-pod-per-file/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/scaling-kubernetes---one-pod-per-file/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2></description></item><item><title>Scaling Your Security Program with Semgrep</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/scaling-security-program-with-semgrep/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/scaling-security-program-with-semgrep/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>This Seesion will run from 17:00-19:00 BST&lt;/strong>
Between Agile, DevOps, and infrastructure as code, development is happening faster than ever. As a security team, it can be tough to keep up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How can we help empower our engineering counterparts to ship software quickly and securely?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This workshop will be a hands-on masterclass of using Semgrep (&lt;a href="https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep)">https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep)&lt;/a>, an open source, lightweight static analysis tool, to do just that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Secure By Scenario</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/secure-by-scenario/secure-by-scenario/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/secure-by-scenario/secure-by-scenario/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2></description></item><item><title>Testing Ephemeral Kubernetes Applications</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/testing-ephemeral-kubernetes-applications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/testing-ephemeral-kubernetes-applications/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2></description></item><item><title>Vendor Security Management using Jira</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/vendor-security-management-using-jira/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/governance/vendor-security-management-using-jira/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2></description></item><item><title>Yor:Automated IaC tag and trace</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/automated-iac-tag-and-trace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2021/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/automated-iac-tag-and-trace/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>
