&lt;p>Enterprise vendors continue to discover new phishing scams, and insert these new techniques into phishing simulations. Is this reasonable and the most effective use of our users time? If AI is so smart why are we wasting users time, when there is evidence suggests that users don&amp;rsquo;t have time to be so watchful and careful? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we stop stressing out our users?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What would it be like to be “there”, just when you were needed, to offer a tap on the shoulder and steer your colleagues in the right direction when they were about to do something risky? Click a link, plug in a USB, upload a file, give away their credentials…? This takes nudge theory to its logical conclusion – timely, in the moment and even measurable. In this talk, Tim will touch on why we should be looking at nudge theory, what makes a good nudge and why, how to run a campaign to steer behaviours, and the potential impact this approach can have. He will also offer some takeaways on how to apply nudge theory, behavioural and learning science to your own awareness campaigns as you build up towards real-time nudges.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rise of Automotive Attacks (Panel Discussion)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/governance/rise-of-automotive-attacks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/governance/rise-of-automotive-attacks/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The rise of automotive hacking: How to secure your vehicles against hacking?
The automotive industry is transforming. Self-driving cars are on the road. Smartphones have turned into keys. Auto-braking mechanisms prevent accidents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Technology is increasingly penetrating the automobile sector. Wireless communication, information technology and Internet of Things (IoT) are making cars more modern, more comfortable and safer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Safer? Well, yes and no.

&lt;p>Shifting left had success, shifting right and adding context is hot as the number of vulnerabilities pre-flight in an SDLC is piling up. Find your path in this modern, challenging. The talk walks through a new approach on risk base approach on vulnerabilities called shift smart.
We will explore the difference between a vulnerability base approach and resolution first vs a risk-based approach and success from real case scenarios&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Taking Your DevOps Tooling To The Dark Side</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/taking-your-devops-tooling-to-the-dark-side/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/taking-your-devops-tooling-to-the-dark-side/</guid><description>&lt;iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT_nMOqlg-1PfAfzMCfwxIRVC1tIZlDzCEUNnsAvQZSZrS8JhFXGWSx54mL0XpWOg/embed?slide=id.p/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true">&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We support battle-hardened production applications every day, but do we hold ourselves accountable to the same standard with our own tools? Learn how to protect the tools that help us to get our jobs done, while accelerating our ability to connect systems together using programmable Zero Trust Networking technology powered by OpenZiti.
The OpenZiti project is an open source initiative focused on bringing Zero Trust to any application. The project gives developers the capability of monitoring anything, anywhere, and doesn’t compromise your solution’s security to do so. No open firewall holes. No exposed web hooks. All private and secure using a zero trust overlay that’s both comprehensive and free.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Threat Modeling Kata Part 2</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/threat-modeling-kata2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/threat-modeling-kata2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="summary-of-the-session">Summary of the session:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Louis, a security architect and platform security lead, analyzes threat modeling in-depth
modeling and introduces the concept of kata for software architectural katas. He explains
the four-step model for threat modeling and suggests using a structured approach from
system architecture instead of relying on threat modeling tools. Louis then discusses a
SaaS solution that supports grading systems in one state of the United States as their
target for evaluation and identifies potential threats from students and teachers.
The transcript discusses the potential risks of cheating in an exam system and suggests
ways to prevent it. They discuss adding an admin to connect with the grading system and
creating architecture diagrams to understand where vulnerabilities may lie. The group also
talks about different components involved in the testing process, such as a Node JS API for
displaying questions and a teacher UI for submitting them. They mention that short answer
and essay questions will be manually graded by teachers before being added to the
system&amp;rsquo;s reporting feature.
The speaker discusses creating documentation with dev teams and the value it adds to
security teams. They also discuss the Python Fast API, node JS UI, and student
authentication for a test-taking system. They emphasize the importance of not giving
admin rights to everything and improving readability in code by aligning arrows and
grouping related items together. The diagram serves as a basis for threat modeling.
Two individuals discuss the potential of creating graphs programmatically to scale their
work. They prefer the simplicity of graphics and want to create relationships between text
and code bases that are created programmatically. The need for change is acknowledged,
but people often resist it due to time constraints. The speakers plan to make connections
between UI and API less wide while acknowledging between UI and API less wide while acknowledging there is room for innovation in this area.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Web application's language negotiation in 2023</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/governance/language-content-negotiation-where-its-where-its-going/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/governance/language-content-negotiation-where-its-where-its-going/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>LCN is a process of selecting the language and content that a web server will respond to a client&amp;rsquo;s request with. It is essential for websites to provide appropriate content in the user&amp;rsquo;s preferred language to enhance their user experience. However, this process can be exploited by attackers, leading to various security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This session will discuss the current state of LCN and its future direction. The session will also cover the potential security risks and best practices to mitigate them. The speaker will share their experience and insights on how organizations can implement effective LCN strategies to enhance their web application security.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
