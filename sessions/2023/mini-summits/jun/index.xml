Most solutions are closed source and try to protect the network. Securing the network isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. Adding zero trust directly to your app is the future and the best way to keep your mission-critical systems secure and running. Zero trust overlay networking can be embedded into your application making the security of the network entirely irrelevant - the isolated application will have zero trust of the internet, local and host OS network.</description></item><item><title>Risk Acceptance and OISRU (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/governance/risk-acceptance-and-oisru/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/governance/risk-acceptance-and-oisru/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Shift Smart - risk based approach on appsec</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/shift-smart-risk-based-approach-on-appsec/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/shift-smart-risk-based-approach-on-appsec/</guid><description>About this session &amp;quot; Shifting left had success, shifting right and adding context is hot as the number of vulnerabilities pre-flight in an SDLC is piling up. Find your path in this modern, challenging. The talk walks trough a new approach on risk base approach on vulnerabilities called shift smart. We will explore the difference between a vulnerability base approach and resolution first vs a risk based approach and success from real case scenarios &amp;quot;</description></item><item><title>Taking Your DevOps Tooling To The Dark Side</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/taking-your-devops-tooling-to-the-dark-side/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/taking-your-devops-tooling-to-the-dark-side/</guid><description>About the session: &amp;ldquo;We support battle-hardened production applications every day, but do we hold ourselves accountable to the same standard with our own tools? Learn how to protect the tools that help us to get our jobs done, while accelerating our ability to connect systems together using programmable Zero Trust Networking technology powered by OpenZiti. The OpenZiti project is an open source initiative focused on bringing Zero Trust to any application.</description></item><item><title>Using Splunk for Incident Response (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/panel-using-splunk-for-incident-response/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/panel-using-splunk-for-incident-response/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Web application's language negotiation in 2023</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/governance/language-content-negotiation-where-its-where-its-going/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/governance/language-content-negotiation-where-its-where-its-going/</guid><description>About this session LCN is a process of selecting the language and content that a web server will respond to a client&amp;rsquo;s request with. It is essential for websites to provide appropriate content in the user&amp;rsquo;s preferred language to enhance their user experience. However, this process can be exploited by attackers, leading to various security vulnerabilities.
This session will discuss the current state of LCN and its future direction. The session will also cover the potential security risks and best practices to mitigate them.</description></item></channel></rss>
