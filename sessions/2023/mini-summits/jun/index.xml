Those that do have an IR playbook, often prepare to respond to infra-related attacks such as ransomware, rather than app. Attacks. Given the prevalence of these attacks, this presentation will provide a quick response playbook and review the characteristics that make AppSec IR deserving of its own plan.

Is this reasonable and the most effective use of our users time? If AI is so smart why are we wasting users time, when there is evidence suggests that users don&amp;rsquo;t have time to be so watchful and careful? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we stop stressing out our users?

Click a link, plug in a USB, upload a file, give away their credentials…? This takes nudge theory to its logical conclusion – timely, in the moment and even measurable. In this talk, Tim will touch on why we should be looking at nudge theory, what makes a good nudge and why, how to run a campaign to steer behaviours, and the potential impact this approach can have.</description></item><item><title>Open Security Summit Awards and plans for 2023</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/oss/open-security-summit-awards-and-2023-plans/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/oss/open-security-summit-awards-and-2023-plans/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Protect Your Application, Not Just the Network - add Zero Trust Superpowers to Your Critical Applications and Systems</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/protect-your-application-not-just-the-network-add-zero-trust-superpowers-to-your-critical-applications-and-systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/protect-your-application-not-just-the-network-add-zero-trust-superpowers-to-your-critical-applications-and-systems/</guid><description>About the session: Applications are the new edge and zero trust is the security industry’s latest hot buzzword. Most solutions are closed source and try to protect the network. Securing the network isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. Adding zero trust directly to your app is the future and the best way to keep your mission-critical systems secure and running. Zero trust overlay networking can be embedded into your application making the security of the network entirely irrelevant - the isolated application will have zero trust of the internet, local and host OS network.</description></item><item><title>Rise of Automotive Attacks (Panel Discussion)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/governance/rise-of-automotive-attacks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/governance/rise-of-automotive-attacks/</guid><description>About this session The rise of automotive hacking: How to secure your vehicles against hacking? The automotive industry is transforming. Self-driving cars are on the road. Smartphones have turned into keys. Auto-braking mechanisms prevent accidents.
Technology is increasingly penetrating the automobile sector. Wireless communication, information technology and Internet of Things (IoT) are making cars more modern, more comfortable and safer.
Safer? Well, yes and no.

Find your path in this modern, challenging. The talk walks through a new approach on risk base approach on vulnerabilities called shift smart. We will explore the difference between a vulnerability base approach and resolution first vs a risk-based approach and success from real case scenarios</description></item><item><title>Taking Your DevOps Tooling To The Dark Side</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/taking-your-devops-tooling-to-the-dark-side/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/jun/devsecops/taking-your-devops-tooling-to-the-dark-side/</guid><description>About the session: &amp;ldquo;We support battle-hardened production applications every day, but do we hold ourselves accountable to the same standard with our own tools?

It is essential for websites to provide appropriate content in the user&amp;rsquo;s preferred language to enhance their user experience. However, this process can be exploited by attackers, leading to various security vulnerabilities.
This session will discuss the current state of LCN and its future direction. The session will also cover the potential security risks and best practices to mitigate them.</description></item></channel></rss>
