Click a link, plug in a USB, upload a file, give away their credentials…? This takes nudge theory to its logical conclusion – timely, in the moment and even measurable. In this talk, Tim will touch on why we should be looking at nudge theory, what makes a good nudge and why, how to run a campaign to steer behaviours, and the potential impact this approach can have. He will also offer some takeaways on how to apply nudge theory, behavioural and learning science to your own awareness campaigns as you build up towards real-time nudges.</p><h2 id=transcript>Transcript:</h2><p>Tim Ward - 00:00
It.</p><p>Dinis Cruz - 00:02
Hi, welcome to this open security summit session in June 2023. And we
have Tim Ward, which is going to continue with talking about nudging and
how to get stuff done. And I&rsquo;m really interesting about how you&rsquo;re taking
it and your theory of awareness. Right. So over to you.</p><p>Tim Ward - 00:23
Brilliant. Thanks very much. Denis? Yes. I want to give you a bit of a spin
through the world of nudge theory and how you can apply that to security
awareness. So it&rsquo;s got a lot of people talking about nudging at the
moment. So I really want to dig into what does it even mean? How can
you do it? What is and isn&rsquo;t a nudge and how can you do it as effectively
as possible? So let&rsquo;s start with what is nudge theory? So I suppose it really
started or gained notoriety through Salah and Sunstein&rsquo;s work and their
book called Nudge Now. They&rsquo;re actually economists and they built a lot
of it on the work of Tvrski and Kanaman, thinking about how do people
behave and their thoughts on fast and slow thinking. And in essence, what
it&rsquo;s about is they called it soft, paternalistic nudges, steering people to
make decisions and do things that are essentially in their best interest.</p><p>Tim Ward - 01:10
So in the past, we perhaps had a more forcing methods based approach.
Nudge is about trying to help people see themselves as doing this thing.
They&rsquo;re less threatening. So really good examples you can think of to see
the difference between forcing and nudging is, and parents probably know
this quite well, if you want your children to tidy their room, well, you could
shout tidy your room. Or you could play a tidy up game, things like
dieting. Maybe you could count calories. That&rsquo;s quite hard. It&rsquo;s a forcing
method. What about using a smaller plate or budgeting? That could be
quite difficult, but maybe going to the supermarket and using a basket
instead of a trolley. So what you&rsquo;re doing is you&rsquo;re sort of structuring your
environment in a way that sort of nudges you or steers you towards doing
the right thing. And in their sort of rewrite of the book, they actually focus
a little bit more on this and this idea of choice architecture and a bit less
on the idea of nudging.</p><p>Tim Ward - 02:04
So choice architecture reflects this fact that we have what you term
limited rationality. We like to think we&rsquo;re all rational beings, we make
really deliberate, deliberative decisions, but actually probably only about
5% of the decisions we make each day are like that. The rest of the time
our brain is overwhelmed with information, so it filters things out in that
we have these cognitive biases that lead us to take shortcuts. And those
cognitive biases are hugely influenced by context and the environment that
you&rsquo;re in. So that environment will steer you towards making decisions.
And the important thing to think about here is that environment exists,
whether we do something with it or not. And so the way that we send our
messages to the organization, we are having an influence, so we might as
well think about doing that. Well, really good example here that&rsquo;s come
from our research is if you call your training mandatory security
awareness training, then you are effectively sending a message that it&rsquo;s for
you.</p><p>Tim Ward - 03:02
And that&rsquo;s the feedback we got in our research, people saying, well, we
know mandatory awareness training is for the company to cover its back,
it&rsquo;s not for us. So even just simple things like that, the way you word
things, the way you phrase things, you are sending a message. So think
about sending the right message. So let&rsquo;s look at a few examples of nudge
theory outlies. So, a supermarket is a great example of a real physical
situation where nudge theory is in play. And choice architecture, I suppose
something has to be on the shelf at Eyeline and it&rsquo;s generally going to be
the thing that the supermarket really wants you to buy. And that is a
choice. It could be a healthy thing and then we&rsquo;ll make healthy choices. It
could be an unhealthy thing like chocolate&rsquo;s right by the till, and those will
be the choices of things that we buy.</p><p>Tim Ward - 03:43
So that&rsquo;s choice architecture. In action school canteens, people have tried
to do nudging here, so getting children to make healthy choices. So, again,
putting the healthy things at eye level, normalizing those choices, making
the vegetarian food look more interesting. So there&rsquo;s some real interesting
types of nudge theory going on there. There&rsquo;s a good example of saving.
So people were encouraged to put an image of the loved one or the thing
they were saving for on the envelope, why they were saving. And it had an
impact on how much they saved because it helped them reflect on the
thing that they were saving towards. Lots of examples around hand
washing or two. So, one, in the NHS, around the time of MRSA, people
had real issues and people needed to wash their hands. So a really
physical nudge was to put on the metal plate you put your hand on to push
the door open, to put the messaging there, highlighting diseases spreading
by bacteria and viruses on that.</p><p>Tim Ward - 04:41
And so people would put their hand on that and almost feel dirty instantly.
And so right through the door they walk through would then be a
sanitation station to help them clean their hands. Great example in a book
called Ripple, which I&rsquo;ll come back to with a reference of people in a
Chilean abattoir. And so they wanted people to wash their hands. So at the
beginning of each coffee break, after they left the abattoir, they would
have a stamp put on their hand of a picture of a germ. And so this created
a real situation where if the stamp hadn&rsquo;t gone, then obviously your
colleagues could see that, but also it meant that you washed your hands
long enough and thoroughly enough to get rid of the stamp. So, very
effective way of changing the environment and rather than telling people
and forcing them, you&rsquo;re effectively steering the behavior.</p><p>Tim Ward - 05:25
You want some great images of examples of nudges. I mean, if you search
the internet, you&rsquo;ll find lots, but we want people to be tidy, why not make it
a game? And I have to slight confession here, I actually did take this photo
myself. So if you get into nudge theory, then when you see it, you&rsquo;ve got to
capture it. The famous one here is a fly in the urinal. This is actually a
goal with a football in urinal and I thought I saw this, I&rsquo;ve got to have a
photo to capture this moment. I&rsquo;m still yet to really understand why it&rsquo;s
needed, but it&rsquo;s clearly a problem. One you&rsquo;ll see all around London on the
escalator, steering people to stand in the right place. And also another one
you&rsquo;ll see all the time crossing the road. In my research for this, it&rsquo;s
important to get this right.</p><p>Tim Ward - 06:11
So here&rsquo;s a great nudge that perhaps might have had the wrong outcome
and quite a dangerous outcome potentially. So do think about what your
nudge is and getting the right outcome from it. So what about sludge?
Very kind of quick, sort of mentioned this is a tangent. So sometimes you
can nudge people and you can be unhelpful and that can be quite
deliberate or maybe accidental. So, for example, password advice that&rsquo;s
too complicated will tend to steer people to doing the wrong thing. A great
example on a government savings website that I saw the other day where
the nice easy thing would have been to create a new password or let
Chrome create a new password and save it. However, the complexity that
they required didn&rsquo;t allow dashes and Chrome was trying to put dashes in.
And so the out is that you end up creating another rubbish password or
reusing a password.</p><p>Tim Ward - 07:05
So you can get this wrong, create Sludge and effectively drive the wrong
behavior or slow people down. There&rsquo;s a great website called Dark
Patterns. I think it&rsquo;s changed now, but this will redirect of examples of
where people have got quite bad sludge. So you see it in booking
processes, I think. Things like Ryanair trying to get you to book all these
extra things. You see it when people are making it hard for you to
unsubscribe or cancel a subscription. And of course the bad guys are doing
evil but duck bad nudges all the time. That&rsquo;s why you see social proof,
authority, urgency, desire, all these things in their phishing emails and
they&rsquo;re using these psychological concepts to make you react really
quickly without really thinking those are nudges, but bad nudges. So what
makes a good nudge? So originally some academics worked with
government to come up with a framework called mind space.</p><p>Tim Ward - 07:59
So each of these letters stood for a thing that you could think about to
create a good nudge. So we&rsquo;re really influenced by who the messenger is.
So that&rsquo;s why marketing has famous celebrities involved in things. So who
would be the celebrity to help you get your message across? Is that
someone in authority within the organization? The people who get the
message across well might just be people who are well connected and
people like and respect in the organization. It might not necessarily be
coming down from the CEO, but that&rsquo;s obviously an option. Incentives not
necessarily a rewards here, but understanding that we like to avoid losses.
So helping people understand that the risk can be helpful. Where this goes
wrong is that perhaps overemphasize thinking about risk and threat and
almost scare people. And I&rsquo;ll come back to that. We&rsquo;re massively
influenced by what other people are doing.</p><p>Tim Ward - 08:47
We&rsquo;re social creatures. Some of the initial research on this was really
interesting. Towels in hotel rooms. So messages that said people in this
hotel have reused their towels and that&rsquo;s better for the environment, that
was quite helpful. That message even more effective was a more specific
message. People who stayed in this room reuse their towels. And so that
specificity of how close that social group is to you can be really effective.
We like to go with the flow, so if it&rsquo;s easy, then we&rsquo;ll do it. That&rsquo;s why we
have things like auto enrollment in pensions. You make the default action
the thing that you want people to do. We&rsquo;re really drawn to things that are
bright and shiny and novel. Again, that&rsquo;s why marketing is so sparkly and
so can we use that in our messages to make them more interesting and
make the key points stand out to people and we confine people.</p><p>Tim Ward - 09:40
So Devon Brown does this when he&rsquo;s trying to get people to say a word or
say animal or something at the end of his thing. He&rsquo;s actually been
priming you and mentioning that thing all the way through, but you
haven&rsquo;t really noticed. So can we prime people? Can we set them up to be
thinking about a certain topic? And I&rsquo;ll show you some examples of that
later. Emotions really effective. But again, perhaps in this industry we&rsquo;ve
fallen down a bit and focused too much on fear. If you create fear without
people feeling they can do anything about it, then you just get a response
of people throwing their hands up in the air and giving up. So you need to
think about a coping strategy as well as using fear. We like to be
consistent with our promises. So this is a really good example of this.</p><p>Tim Ward - 10:21
In the research, people asked to put a really ugly banner in their garden
advertising something. It was a charitable thing, but they asked and most
people said no. But in one group the week before they&rsquo;ve been asked to
put a tiny postcard in their window and the people who have been asked
to do that wanted to remain consistent with what they&rsquo;d done and so they
were much more likely to then show the banner. And so we can use this
idea of commitment, we can convince people that they are or tell people
that they&rsquo;re behaving in a secure way. Well done, you&rsquo;re secure. People
want to then can stay consistent with that image and that label that you
put on them. Obviously we all act in ways that make us feel better about
ourselves so we can think about playing people&rsquo;s egos and flattery. And so
that was the original model called Mindspace and then lots to think about
there.</p><p>Tim Ward - 11:12
You don&rsquo;t have to use them all, but a simpler model is perhaps the east
model. So this very simplistically says there&rsquo;s four components to an
effective nudge. It&rsquo;s got to be easy, the thing you want people to do, so
you&rsquo;ve got to create a view of how easy it is or make sure you&rsquo;re creating
ease. So if you&rsquo;re telling people about passwords then maybe you should
be giving them a password manager to help them make that simple. It&rsquo;s
got to be attractive, people got to want to do it or at least understand why.
So we need to help them with their motivation. It&rsquo;s got to be social
because that&rsquo;s a really important thing. We&rsquo;re driven by what other people
are doing but really importantly, it has to be timely in some way. So you&rsquo;ve
got to help people when it matters, when it&rsquo;s relevant, if you tell someone
about something at the wrong time, they&rsquo;re just going to ignore it.</p><p>Tim Ward - 11:59
So let&rsquo;s think about how we might apply that. And a really simple message
here is, look, you&rsquo;re communicating anyway. If you&rsquo;re in the world of
awareness, you&rsquo;re trying to get these messages out, so refine it, use things
like mind space, think about cognitive biases, there&rsquo;s lots of other things
out there. Reciprocity is a really useful one to think about if you can say
the security team have blocked this many phishing emails. Have you
reported any? You&rsquo;re kind of saying, look, we&rsquo;ve given something, can you
give something back? And so there&rsquo;s different ways to just tune the
message that you&rsquo;re already delivering and here&rsquo;s a really good example.
So this comes from the book Ripple by Groom and Vellicott and it was
Tesco trying to get people to sign up to their delivery saver and they got
just from some very minor tweaks, they got a 10% uplift in impact.</p><p>Tim Ward - 12:45
So firstly they framed it as a loss and you see this all over the internet,
that idea of scarcity, we don&rsquo;t like missing out on things, so don&rsquo;t miss out
on an unlimited free deliveries. Then they used this idea of an image of a
friendly face. I love this idea of putting us in a hot state of receiving
groceries but that is obviously the kind of the thing were trying to you&rsquo;re
going to get something. It&rsquo;s a gift. And it was a smiling face. We like that
positivity. We will feel the need to we will feel warm inside and almost
smile back. And then that face was looking towards the key message,
which was that customers saved and then a really specific number. So not
just roughly 75 pounds, you get authority by using a specific value. And so
this had a real impact in how effective their messaging was.</p><p>Tim Ward - 13:32
Simple things, simple tweaks. And most of us will think, I wouldn&rsquo;t fall for
that sort of stuff, but actually when you&rsquo;re just skimming reading, skim
reading things, your subconscious is using these cognitive biases to make
decisions so they will work. So if you&rsquo;re going to do this, what we&rsquo;re really
saying here is we&rsquo;re trying to think about behavior change. How do we
move slightly beyond awareness and think about how we can use nudges
to drive people to act in a particular way. And so it&rsquo;s worth looking at
some behavior change models. So Fog&rsquo;s model is really interesting here
and you can see some similarities with the east model. Fog says that for
any behavior to happen, there has to be an element of motivation. You&rsquo;ve
got to want to do it. Now that&rsquo;s why the bad guys use all these cognitive
biases in their phishing emails.</p><p>Tim Ward - 14:21
They&rsquo;re trying to just make you think, oh, I have to do this, it&rsquo;s urgent, I
have to click. There&rsquo;s an element of ability. Can you do this? Is this
something you know how to do? And then importantly, there&rsquo;s some sort of
timely prompt, something that creates that drive to actually act at a
particular time. And so motivation and ability need to be enough to
prompt you. And so Frogdor draws this graph and say, look, together
they&rsquo;ve got to be enough to get you past this line. And so this kind of
makes logical sense to say, look, if you&rsquo;re really willing and motivated to
do something, then you can do really difficult things. Or if something&rsquo;s
really easy, then you can do them even if you&rsquo;re not particularly motivated.
And so if you reflect on where secure behaviors sit, unfortunately they sit
in this unwilling, unmotivated area.</p><p>Tim Ward - 15:11
And that&rsquo;s not because people don&rsquo;t want to act securely, but it&rsquo;s because
there are lots of other motivations driving them. So it might be they&rsquo;ve got
to get something done for their boss, they&rsquo;ve got other things that drive
them to act in a particular way. So we need to think about making the
secure behavior as easy as possible, which again, the east model does
suggest. Boggle also says some interesting things about the order in which
you try and tackle this. And this is simply in terms of how easy it is. So he
says motivation is the hardest lever of change. And unfortunately, that&rsquo;s
where we have tended to start in security awareness. With that kind of
scare people, help them understand the threat and if you reflect on this, if
motivation was all we needed, we just had to want to do something, then
we&rsquo;d all be fit, we&rsquo;d all be really healthily.</p><p>Tim Ward - 15:55
But motivation is complicated. You might want to do one thing, but you&rsquo;ve
got competing motivations. I want to be fit, I want to go to the gym, I
want to eat cake. And those things are in encounter and so you don&rsquo;t
necessarily do them. So don&rsquo;t start with motivation. If you could start with
a prompt and just nudge people to think about something and that is
effective, then you don&rsquo;t need to do anything else. Then you can think
about ease, then you can think about motivation. A great example he gives
around keeping fit people who want to get out there and exercise. Put
your running kit ready to put on as you get out of bed. So it acts as a
visual prompt and you&rsquo;re making it really easy because you get dressed
and you put your running gear on. Now I do know people who then spend
the whole day walking around in that kit and don&rsquo;t actually do any
exercise.</p><p>Tim Ward - 16:40
But it&rsquo;s a starting point. It&rsquo;s made it as easy as possible and it&rsquo;s acted as a
prompt. So let&rsquo;s try and apply that to a real example, getting people to act
securely around the threat of phishing. And if we&rsquo;re going to do this using
Fog&rsquo;s model, then let&rsquo;s do it in the right order. Start with the prompt. So
we&rsquo;re looking at a way to just trigger people to think, be careful in
phishing. So timeless is really important. You want to deliver it as close to
use of email as possible. The message is kind of you&rsquo;re an email, remember
phishing or is this link safe? And so a clearly visible reporting button if
you&rsquo;ve got that, can be a really good prompt. Now obviously you do have
an issue of habituation there, which is if it&rsquo;s the same thing in the same
place all the time, your brain filters it out.</p><p>Tim Ward - 17:26
But timeliness is key here. So get something into the email system. When
people are using email, then we can think about ability, make it easy. So
here I would suggest don&rsquo;t try and overcomplicate it. Like even experts for
phishing, it&rsquo;s not necessarily a knowledge thing. You&rsquo;ve got to have a base
level of understanding. But you don&rsquo;t necessarily need people to
understand every single aspect. What you do want is to reinforce the need
to be cautious with email and maybe focus on things that humans can
spot. Which is someone trying to get me to do something I don&rsquo;t
necessarily want to do? Am I being manipulated? Rather than trying to
spot technical things and then make it really easy to act. So it&rsquo;s a simple
message, it doesn&rsquo;t feel right. Report it again back to the reporting button
and then we can think about motivation. And obviously you probably need
to do all of these things but maybe do it in this order.</p><p>Tim Ward - 18:14
So motivation, you&rsquo;re trying to help people understand the threat because
they&rsquo;ve got to be bothered to act. So you could highlight how many
phishing emails have been received and blocked by security. So that&rsquo;s a
reciprocity thing. Show people real examples and this is a great
opportunity to have that social proof look. Other colleagues have reported
this. Have you, the MD got this? Have you spotted any helps people
understand both that this thing is happening but also that they could do
something about it and that their colleagues are so what could that look
like? Well, one of the things that we did in some research with Cardiff
University was simple as you open outlook we delivered some sort of
reminder. Now this is magnified a bit to make it easy to read and there
was some interesting psychology in this as well. So it&rsquo;s timely. It&rsquo;s
appeared as I open my inbox, it&rsquo;s salient because it&rsquo;s kind of jumping out
on me a little bit, it&rsquo;s priming me so that as I then go into my inbox,
phishing is something I&rsquo;m thinking about.</p><p>Tim Ward - 19:07
So even if I read this really scan it in 5 seconds it&rsquo;s gone. It is helping. And
then interestingly, we found this initial sentence that focused on threat was
quite helpful. We compared threat and coping and other researchers
suggested coping is more effective. But actually we found this little bit of
threat helped the really precise number added authority and then the final
thing your inbox is at equal risk was trying to counter out optimism bias.
So we found that we tried just threat on its own, optimism bias on its own.
If we put these three together, we had the most impact on people and so it
had a significant impact on whether people went forward and spotted
phishing in their inbox. So let&rsquo;s take that back and think about
engagement generally, we want people to engage with our content. So let&rsquo;s
go back to the fog model again, really important thing, timeliness.</p><p>Tim Ward - 19:58
We have to say annual awareness is clearly not very timely. So it is a poor
prompt and Ebbing house is graph that shows that after about five days
you can only remember about 20% comes into play here. You&rsquo;re just not
going to remember things. So timeness is really important. Drip feeding is
really helpful. The spacing effect of spreading content out through the
year keep it ongoing. And what we also find is that making it topical can
be really effective. So this plays to availability in that you link it to
something that people are aware of in the news and so that when they
think about that thing, they might also think about the thing you want to
think about security. So link things with topical things going on in the
world then make it easy, so easy to access your content. So bring the
content to the user if you can, rather than expecting them to go and get it.</p><p>Tim Ward - 20:47
Make it quick and easy to digest, add a bit of user choice, an element of
how they use it, but also ease in terms of can I do the thing you&rsquo;re trying
to teach me? So, simple messaging and really obviously actionable advice,
things people can do and then back to motivation. Again, you&rsquo;re trying to
help people with their threat appraisal. We find that people engage a bit
more with understanding the impact and threat to their personal context.
But obviously if they learn to do those good behaviors, not reuse
passwords, then some of that rubs off at work. We do have the fear of loss.
So if you want to drive people away from a behavior, you can play on that,
but not too much. If you want to drive towards a behavior, you probably
want to set it in a more positive frame. So those are some examples.</p><p>Tim Ward - 21:31
So pulling that all together, we think there&rsquo;s a sweet spot here. And so if
you think about behavior, all behavior takes place in a context. For most
of us, that&rsquo;s going to be our it, there&rsquo;s a trigger and then we act. And as an
industry, we&rsquo;ve been trying to solve the awareness problem in the wrong
place. It&rsquo;s not in the context where the threat lies. It almost doesn&rsquo;t matter
how good and funky these videos escape rooms elearning is. Obviously if
it&rsquo;s good, then people won&rsquo;t hate you for making them do it. But by the
time you get back to your desk, much of it is forgotten. It&rsquo;s not in the
context where the threat lies and it tends to be too infrequent. And then
we&rsquo;re seeing on this side where it&rsquo;s kind of too late. So maybe responding
to incidents in the scene, well, obviously that&rsquo;s useful to know where
behaviors lie, but it&rsquo;s happened.</p><p>Tim Ward - 22:16
And if you deliver content afterwards, again by sending emails, then that&rsquo;s
a channel that is just too busy. But also it&rsquo;s seen as punishment with
training. Now, you might not see it as that, but I can promise you the
people on the other end of it see it as punishment with training. And it&rsquo;s
also quite hard for people to contextualize. So if you get told after
something&rsquo;s happened that this is how you should have dealt with it, most
of us will rationalize and go, well, I&rsquo;m sure I was doing that for good
reason at the time. So they&rsquo;ll tend to be ignoring what you&rsquo;re telling them.
So our research has suggested there&rsquo;s two sweet spots actually. One is
here priming people just before the behavior happens. So like that Cardiff
example, the Cardiff research, as you open your inbox, just that&rsquo;s the place
you need to know about Phishing or as you open LinkedIn, that&rsquo;s the place
you need to think about sharing data about the company or yourself to be
careful.</p><p>Tim Ward - 23:05
So that&rsquo;s when you need to hear about something and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be
long and it can be relatively subconscious as well. But even more
interesting nudging here actually when the behavior is taking place. So as
someone is about to click a link, as they&rsquo;re about to upload a file, maybe
as they click the link and they&rsquo;re about to give away their credentials,
trying to find those opportunities to intervene. And if you can see that
behavior, you can baseline and monitor it silently, get that baseline and
then when you start to intervene, you can see that you&rsquo;re changing it. And
that&rsquo;s really what we focus on. That&rsquo;s our thing with think cyber with red
flags, measuring those behaviors and then driving and delivering content
to drive behavior change. So let&rsquo;s look a little bit more at what we mean
by behavior change. And so I suppose I&rsquo;m talking about instead of running
security awareness campaigns, we&rsquo;re actually talking about running
behavior change campaigns.</p><p>Tim Ward - 23:56
And the best way to do that we found, is focus one behavior at a time or
maybe a group of related behaviors. So it&rsquo;s really clear to people what
they need to focus on. You should expect it to take two to three months to
see an impact and during that time you&rsquo;re being really coherent, consistent
with the sort of content you&rsquo;re pushing out. You can be relatively subtle
and infrequent. You&rsquo;re trying to build a habit, you&rsquo;re not necessarily trying
to hit people every single time something happens. And you do need to mix
things up. So that&rsquo;s why you do two to three months one topic and then
you might want to change to a completely different topic because you
want to avoid habituation. So it&rsquo;s got to be different content throughout.
And then you switch to a different topic so that&rsquo;s what it can look like.</p><p>Tim Ward - 24:34
And here&rsquo;s an example. We have a check the sender campaign. So we
might start by telling people why it&rsquo;s important to check the sender before
you click a link. But in the background, sorry, in the first couple of weeks
you&rsquo;re actually just tracking how often are people clicking links in emails
from people they don&rsquo;t know. Then you deliver this story to explain, well,
why do you need to do it, why is it important? Help people understand the
threat behind the scenes. You&rsquo;re still tracking how often people are kicking
links in emails from people they don&rsquo;t know. Then you might do a reminder
and you turn one of these real time nudges where you&rsquo;re nudging people
as they&rsquo;re about to click a link. So you&rsquo;re reinforcing that message at
exactly the point someone&rsquo;s about to do the thing you&rsquo;re worried about.
And then in the final week, again, another reminder and continue the
nudging.</p><p>Tim Ward - 25:16
And what you can see in this time period is a real change. And I&rsquo;ll show
you that in a graph in a second. So what does that story, what does that
content look like to. Introduce it. So what we do here is we will push
content straight out onto the device, really short and sharp, maybe takes a
minute to read, really conspicuous. So you&rsquo;re looking at ease because it&rsquo;s
easy to digest because it&rsquo;s on the device, it&rsquo;s timely, it&rsquo;s salient, it looks
interesting, and it plays to availability because it&rsquo;s then in your mind and
you&rsquo;ve been thinking about it and obviously you&rsquo;re tracking who&rsquo;s seen it,
how have they reacted, how long have they looked at it for? Then you
might deliver a reminder as people open their inbox. Again, I&rsquo;ve magnified
this a little bit just to remind you, look, this is where you ought to be
thinking about, do I really know the sender before I click on the link
again, it&rsquo;s timely, it&rsquo;s salient, and we&rsquo;re priming people to think about this.</p><p>Tim Ward - 26:05
And then perhaps when I get this rather dodgy email and I&rsquo;m about to
click the link, this is where the real time nudging could come in to say,
look, are you sure you know this sender? And a big red arrow pointing to
who the email is from. So you&rsquo;re either possibly just reminding people
relatively subconsciously because this isn&rsquo;t forcing them to stop. They
don&rsquo;t have to click, okay? It just appears and follows their mouse around.
Or you&rsquo;re knocking them out of their automatic pilot. Their system one
thinking into a more deliberative mode to go. Oh, hold on. Let&rsquo;s stop and
think about this behind the scenes. Obviously you&rsquo;re tracking this. How
often do they hover? How often do they click? And this graph shows some
of the impact you can have. So the spikes are where we&rsquo;re delivering
content and people are engaging. The top line is how often people hover
and the bottom is how often they actually click the link.</p><p>Tim Ward - 26:50
And so just within a month, you&rsquo;re seeing a reduction in people clicking
links and emails from people they don&rsquo;t know. So I suppose what I&rsquo;m
talking about here is almost an ability to deliver real time awareness, this
right content, exactly the right time in the right way. And so I almost
propose a manifesto for what do we mean by real time security awareness
because people are talking about a little bit and talking about nudge
theory. So my take on this is that it&rsquo;s about supporting people and helping
them as close to the point of risk as possible and you&rsquo;re trying to steer
them towards a secure behavior. It&rsquo;s not meant to be a tool to find new
mediums to nag people or to spot behaviors and then go and tell them off.
And so it&rsquo;s important, it might be attractive to think, well, what if we could
message people in WhatsApp, in Slack, in teams, in SMS?</p><p>Tim Ward - 27:39
That&rsquo;s great if your message is relevant and timely to where the threat is
and what the threat is in what they&rsquo;re doing. But if you&rsquo;re just using a
Slack message to tell them about, I don&rsquo;t know, phishing or something
that&rsquo;s not really relevant. You&rsquo;ve really just found another medium to nag
people via. So you need to think about what do you mean by real time?
And it should be trying to help people when it&rsquo;s relevant and timely. And
again, I talked about this earlier, responding to events in the scene, it&rsquo;s not
really timely enough. The event has already happened and so you risk
getting into this cycle like we&rsquo;ve been with phishing simulations where
you&rsquo;re effectively punishing people with training. And I think this matters
because it&rsquo;s really this choice between helping people, guiding, steering
them and focusing on reducing risk, or an alternative which is just other
ways to nag people and tell them they&rsquo;ve got something wrong.</p><p>Tim Ward - 28:29
So we&rsquo;re trying to help people and steer them and get them on our side
and essentially try and build that culture that values security. So let&rsquo;s look
at a few other examples of what that could look like. So, example here, I
open my inbox and I just get this nudge from the top of the screen. Now,
even if I ignore this, I&rsquo;ve been primed again. So you&rsquo;ve got this salience,
you&rsquo;ve got Priming, it&rsquo;s timely, but also you can play into this a bit of
social proof. So this nudge doesn&rsquo;t show it, but what we would often put
here will be something like Freddie accounts or the MD or someone
spotted this phishing. Have you reported any? So you&rsquo;ve got social proof.
You could highlight the skid team of block stuff and you can use
reciprocity. So these are some of the things that highlight at the bottom of
the slide where you&rsquo;re playing to these cognitive biases.</p><p>Tim Ward - 29:14
And there&rsquo;s a bit of a feedback loop as well. So if I click on this, the idea is
I get shown an example of a real phishing email. So rather than just
training people who fail a phishing test, why not show everybody an
example of what phishing looks like? Different examples of things hitting
the organization, maybe once a month, maybe once every two months. Or
perhaps if I actually click a link and then I get to a web page and start to
enter my credentials, well, we could spot this a nudge at this point. So
really timely, really relevant. You&rsquo;ve just clicked a link in an email from
someone you don&rsquo;t know. You&rsquo;re now adding your password. Are you
really sure you want to do this? And obviously you&rsquo;d run this with an allow
list so that you wouldn&rsquo;t nudge on things people are meant to use.</p><p>Tim Ward - 29:55
But actually, you can take this far beyond this. You can think about
phishing, data loss, safe routing, connecting to Insecure, WiFi. So here&rsquo;s
an example. Nudging when people try and upload something to dropbox,
this is actually really generic. So normally we would think to change this,
to tune it to the organization, to say, this organization, this is the tool we
want to use. It&rsquo;s far more effective to drive people towards a behavior
than away from behavior. And that does mean you need to stop and think
a little bit if you want to run a behavior change campaign, what&rsquo;s the
behavior you want? And have you got an easy way, have you got the tools
in place to allow people to do that? Because it&rsquo;s all very well sort of
steering a behavior, but it has to be towards a good course of action that
you actually want people to do.</p><p>Tim Ward - 30:37
Another example could just be sending an email too many people. Again,
we&rsquo;re not just nudging to say stop it, we&rsquo;re telling people how to use it,
how to enable BCC if it&rsquo;s not even there or maybe signing up to it, the
systems that you don&rsquo;t really want people to sign into. So this could be the
use case, could be around credential stuffing it, could be using it that
hasn&rsquo;t been sanctioned, but also things that move into the DLP type world.
So sending things to webmail addresses, sending attachments internally
where you might want to drive people to send links to reduce the risk of a
document going to the wrong place. And finally nudging around different
websites. So social media, we just added a chat GPT nudge. So not
necessarily blocking the sites, but making sure that when you see people
go there, you can very subtly nudge them.</p><p>Tim Ward - 31:28
So the mouse changes to say look, please don&rsquo;t share any commercial data
here. Now obviously you could have a nudge that was a bit more bold,
took over the screen and said look, this is how to use this and here&rsquo;s our
policy on it. So just to pull that together. To final observations of what I&rsquo;ve
been talking about, we can&rsquo;t always rely on people making rational
decisions that we&rsquo;re really driven by context. And so nudging is about
shaping that choice architecture, that context, so we get the behavior that
we actually want to see. There&rsquo;s some really good frameworks out there
that we can use. So east standing for ease, ability, social and timely and
the mindspace model to start thinking about how do I change my
messaging, so I&rsquo;m thinking about ways of making it more impactful. All of
these models suggest that timeliness and context are really fundamental.</p><p>Tim Ward - 32:19
So that&rsquo;s what we should be thinking about and where we should be
helping people. But if you&rsquo;re going to do that, these real time interventions
we believe should be about supporting people, not just finding new ways to
nag them. And if you can make it measurable because you want to
understand how often behaviors happen, try and build a baseline and then
start to nudge away from it. Because if you can make this measurable, you
can actually sort of tangibly say I am reducing risk. So what we&rsquo;re trying
to talk about here is taking nudge almost to its logical conclusion. A sort
of a more physical tap on the shoulder, I suppose to actually measurably
drive secure behavior change. And that&rsquo;s very much what we&rsquo;re focused
on, using red flags. So couldn&rsquo;t resist this. It&rsquo;s a nudge, which is don&rsquo;t miss
a chance to ask questions.</p><p>Tim Ward - 33:03
Could obviously email me, although I haven&rsquo;t put my email here, which
isn&rsquo;t very helpful. It&rsquo;s Tim at thinksyber co UK or reach out on LinkedIn.
But Dennis, I don&rsquo;t know if we got a mechanism for people to ask
questions on there.</p><p>Dinis Cruz - 33:15
Yeah, they could put in a chat. I don&rsquo;t see a lot of stuff, but I got a couple
for you here. So I really like the whole real time nudging. I think it&rsquo;s really
powerful. Have you have any experience doing that? For example, in the
middle of bigger security transformation programs. So I&rsquo;m a big fan, for
example, of using incidents as strategic. So I take a P three and I run as a
P one. So I put a lot of my team on it. And the reason why we do that is we
also fix a lot of things. For example, I think we even have a scenario where
once in an incident, we even create security awareness content during the
incident, distributed it during the period, and the idea was to solve that
problem of if you do it afterward, the post mortem, the momentum is
gone.</p><p>Dinis Cruz - 34:04
Like it&rsquo;s not relevant. Makes sense. So in a way it&rsquo;s not as I guess the
email and some of the examples are shown. It&rsquo;s like when something
happened. But I found that world where you basically are able to, for
example, while something is hot, when incident is hot or something is
happening or a team is working, that&rsquo;s a great way to nudge a lot of those
behaviors. Nudge. A lot of that changes even to say this exists by the way,
you didn&rsquo;t use it, this actually is there. And I found that people this makes
them much more susceptible to be nudged, if that makes sense.</p><p>Tim Ward - 34:39
Yeah, no, I&rsquo;d agree with that. And I think because the mechanism here is
that we&rsquo;re putting content on a content server and it&rsquo;s being pushed down
onto devices so it can be delivered sort of right there on the device that
enables us to respond to events in the wider world. So we&rsquo;ve helped people
with comms related to Ukraine, to COVID, but also it can be incident
based. So we&rsquo;ve helped people so incident happens. We were planning to
do different content, but the next day we&rsquo;re pushing out content that&rsquo;s
relevant to that. And obviously that&rsquo;s great for the security team because
they&rsquo;re seen by the board or whoever, the stakeholders as being really
responsive and kind of getting that messaging out. So absolutely I agree
because it&rsquo;s again a place to availability, doesn&rsquo;t it? People are seeing the
impact of something, so now is a great time to tell them about it.</p><p>Tim Ward - 35:27
We&rsquo;ve also seen interesting things where if a competitor has an incident or
someone in your world then that sort of content being pushed out, people
dive on it because it&rsquo;s really relevant. They go, okay, this really happens in
our industry. This is something that we should understand.</p><p>Dinis Cruz - 35:45
What about in for example an area of let&rsquo;s say identity access
management where you nudge, let&rsquo;s say the risk owners to what&rsquo;s been
happening. So for example the whole thing, hey, do you have access to this
or your team members are success this or even a regular nudge to go, this
is what you and your team currently own. Is this still correct? Because
those are in a way not as reactive nudges but it keeps reinforcing the idea
of people to reduce the attack surface to go, oh, I don&rsquo;t anymore. Again,
that behavior of getting the users to take more accountability and to in a
way accept certain risks but you need to keep nudging them that the.</p><p>Tim Ward - 36:27
Risks are still there. Yeah. Obviously don&rsquo;t tell the comms team but this
approach almost becomes a new channel that you can communicate some
of your security messaging with. So we have actually done some of that
site thing. I think we did something around a kind of a spring clean of
spring cleaning your teams, groups and stuff just to remind people from
time to time. So I suppose that comes into the priming thing and you can
do it so you could spot that they have gone to teams or that they&rsquo;ve gone
to SharePoint and that would be a timely time to say can you just check
who&rsquo;s got permissions to this? When did you last check permissions or
something like that just to kind of yes, it&rsquo;s a bit more scheduled but it also
can be made timely as well. Yeah.</p><p>Dinis Cruz - 37:11
And I guess my father&rsquo;s point, what I like about some of these things is
that it also allow us to bring some science to some of the things we do.
And this is quite recognized that we know it works. Right nudging. The
whole social media companies might have abused that but the bottom line
is that it does actually work quite well to change behavior.</p><p>Tim Ward - 37:30
Yeah. And in fact I often talk about it in my talks. The fact that I don&rsquo;t
really call them the goodbyes but guys, but the likes of TikTok, Twitter,
Facebook, they&rsquo;re using these content biases against all the time and
getting us to scroll and obviously that&rsquo;s to show us more ads and keep us
on the platform. But why can&rsquo;t we use the same technique and the bad
guys are using the techniques as well. Why can&rsquo;t we use the techniques for
good to help ourselves? Absolutely. But yeah, absolutely cool. Yeah.</p><p>Dinis Cruz - 38:01
Look, I don&rsquo;t think we got for the question, so thanks for your session. And
I think there&rsquo;s definitely a couple of panels we should do on the back of
this because I think it&rsquo;s definitely a key topic and it&rsquo;d be cool to explore
other examples, other areas that it can be used in our industry, because I
think it&rsquo;s definitely maturing. I would say that I think that we talked about
this offline. I think that the LLMs and the Chat GPT kind of analysis is a
good example of it. Either will make some of the stuff you do a commodity
or allow it to be even more relevant. I guess the interesting element here is
that I think it allows you to consume a lot more data and to make things a
lot more customized in context to the person.</p><p>Tim Ward - 38:44
You can definitely tune it to say, how do I create a persuasive message for
someone who is like this? And how do I make that just in two lines of text?
I mean, that&rsquo;s where the language model, I think, can play can come in
and be really effective and also make it the right sort of level for the
audience.</p><p>Dinis Cruz - 39:04
Exactly. Well, there&rsquo;s a good session for next time.</p><p>Tim Ward - 39:07
Yeah, brilliant. Excellent.
