Is this reasonable and the most effective use of our users time? If AI is so smart why are we wasting users time, when there is evidence suggests that users don&rsquo;t have time to be so watchful and careful? Shouldn&rsquo;t we stop stressing out our users?</p><h2 id=transcript>Transcript:</h2><p>Speaker 1 - 00:00
You.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 00:02
Hi, welcome to this Open Security Summit session in June 2023. And here
we have Sarb doing another session. It&rsquo;s almost like a series now where
he&rsquo;s looking at a lot of the user interactions. And I think this one is going
to take an interesting twist of that on AI, where some of our users are
actually smarter than it, and let&rsquo;s see how we can adopt the new
technologies to actually make something work that it wasn&rsquo;t working as
well.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 00:25
So Sarb over to you. Thank you very much.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 00:28
And it&rsquo;s an honor as always to be on these. Thanks for having me on. Just
a quick starting point to let people know this session is less about AI and
more about users and more about how users behave and how they don&rsquo;t
behave. And I use myself as a typical example of a typical user. And you&rsquo;ll
see that as we go through. So let&rsquo;s get started then. Okay, so gender, first
of all, am I smart in AI? Then after, I&rsquo;ll be looking at thinking fast,
thinking slow, the NCSE data breach statistics. What is the number one
problem or issue that they talk about? What wasn&rsquo;t in the statistics? What
if AI had been used in those circumstances? And sort of advice we&rsquo;ve been
giving.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 01:23
Our users and the cost of training and so on.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 01:27
And then going back to that question, is AI smarter than our users? So,
first of all, am I smarter than AI and how smart is AI? The main graphic
there in that sort of montage is effectively the city and the head in the
center, because basically our views of AI were based on movies and what
AI could and could not do. And it was computers that would be connected
to everything and they&rsquo;d be able to do things really fast. And then more
later movies, we&rsquo;ve got things like the image on the left hand side, like a
robotic. And then maybe you may be thinking we&rsquo;re in our infancy, and
that image on the top right is maybe AI in its infancy. But the reality is, if
we look at AI, we are probably, if we look at evolution more like the
spider, the acronym. And really that is where I think we probably are.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 02:27
It is very early days, and if you were lucky enough to attend the sessions
that were run earlier on AI by Dennis, that would be a very good one on
some of the early things that he&rsquo;s seen, how they&rsquo;ve changed.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 02:45
And I think the changes are going.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 02:46
To come very quickly. So that&rsquo;s really those things that AI can do. And our
impressions of AI. If I move to next slide, you see I&rsquo;m probably not smarter
than AI. I do not have the capability to store all the sorts of books that are
in the library. I do not have the capability to analyze lots and lots of
information all in one go. I have not got the capability to be able to do
complex mechanics and engineering calculations and certainly don&rsquo;t have
the sort of wider capabilities of being able to see and analyze lots and lots
of different images from all over the place. And although I may not have
those, I do consider myself as sort of smarter than a standard user. I&rsquo;m not
a standard user. I am an advanced use of Microsoft. I do use Microsoft
Office in lots of different ways.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 03:46
I do touch type, I do lots and lots of things which standard users do not
do. So I am slightly smarter than an ordinary standard user. But just
because I&rsquo;m sort of slightly smarter than a standard user, all that has been
experience, all that has been things that I&rsquo;ve gained along the years and
that&rsquo;s all assuming in the same way it&rsquo;s experienced my experience and
what.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 04:11
I&rsquo;ve learned over a period of time. Effectively I&rsquo;ve learned it because things
stay the same.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 04:18
In some respects. What I would say is what if everything didn&rsquo;t stay the
same?</p><p>Speaker 1 - 04:24
What if things changed and they changed?</p><p>Speaker 3 - 04:27
Rickly? Would we still be happy like that.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 04:30
Second ball or balloon? Or would we be more like this.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 04:35
Girl pretty disappointed and upset that things are not what we expected
from them and they are changing and they&rsquo;re changing regularly. Well
we&rsquo;re going to be that upset, angry, depressed. And how is that going to
affect us? And are we likely to move into that if things change and they&rsquo;re
changing ways that we&rsquo;re not expecting them to change? What are we
going to be more like? Well I don&rsquo;t use that cuts off language but are we
going to be more like that? And if we are tech savvy are we going to be
more like that?</p><p>Speaker 1 - 05:05
And the thing is, in terms of.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 05:08
How we do things and what we.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 05:10
Change and what we don&rsquo;t change, what.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 05:12
I like to look at and how we&rsquo;re used to in terms of interacting with our
surroundings I&rsquo;ve done.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 05:19
A lot of work, probably in the.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 05:22
Last year and a half, two years around user interfaces and looking at
what makes and what doesn&rsquo;t make a good user experience. Through that
I came across lots of user experience, designers and sort of things that
they take into consideration. They&rsquo;re taking consideration the way we
think, the way we behave, how people take lazy options. What sort of
words, phrases help people complete whatever they&rsquo;re trying to complete?
What colors work, which ones don&rsquo;t work. How to make things appear
familiar. Where in the screen and the place should things be to make it
appear far more familiar? And how can they make things consistent for
us? So user design sort of experts, they actually really look at all of these
sorts of things. Now if we didn&rsquo;t have those user.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 06:09
Designs, designers looking at these things, some.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 06:13
Of the things that we take for.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 06:14
Granted wouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 06:17
And there are certain ways that we&rsquo;ve come to expect in terms of the
interfaces that we use. Whether you use Windows platform, Apple
platform, you&rsquo;re talking about your mobile platforms, all of them have
certain standards that they use and then they use them in certain way. And
that enables us to learn and do what we try to do. And that ables us to
take advantage of some of the things that we try to do. This is some of the
research that goes back to many years. And there&rsquo;s a book a couple of
years back now, I think 2008 by Daniel Kahnman, which looked at fast
thinking, slow thinking, and really we sort of class lots of different types of
thinking into the two. I&rsquo;ll start with the right hand side, the slow thinking.
Slow thinking is very rarely done. It&rsquo;s hard, it&rsquo;s deliberate, it&rsquo;s rational,
and it is reliable.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 07:08
And that slow thinking. The best example I can give you off the top of my
head is.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 07:12
When you learn to drive, and you.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 07:14
Learn to drive, everything is a chore. You are looking at everything. You
cannot have a conversation. You&rsquo;re trying to make sure that you&rsquo;re doing
everything right. By the time you&rsquo;ve passed your test and you&rsquo;ve been
driving for a few years, basically what you&rsquo;ve done is you&rsquo;ve now changed
your mode of thinking about how you&rsquo;re driving into fast thinking because
it&rsquo;s much more common in your driving and what you&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s easy,
it&rsquo;s automatic, it&rsquo;s emotional, it&rsquo;s.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 07:41
Error prone to an extent, but you.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 07:43
Do get through that. Basically what Carmen talked about in the Fast and
slow Thinking is most of.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 07:50
Us, on an average day, we tend.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 07:53
To have these models that we&rsquo;ve built for ourselves in how we interpret
everything into fast thinking. And it&rsquo;s very important that we use these
things because when we&rsquo;re doing what we&rsquo;re trying to do, whether we&rsquo;re
at work, whether we&rsquo;re as users in front of our computers trying to do
things.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 08:12
Or anything else, that we have in life.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 08:15
We try to do things in the fast way of thinking and try and come up with
ways that we can reduce the burden on our brains to have to do slow
thinking. It is something that requires you to rethink about what you&rsquo;re
doing.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 08:31
And now I&rsquo;m going to break there.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 08:33
And I&rsquo;ll come back to this train of thought in a short while. What I want to
do is just look at the NCSE Data Breach Survey from 2023. So that came
out in April, so about two months ago. And one of the first few things that
it covers is about the percentage of organizations that have carried out
the following activities to identify cyber risks within the last twelve
months. So it&rsquo;s things like using specified specific tools designed for
security monitoring, risk assessment tested staff, which includes mock
phishing exercises. And if you look at that&rsquo;s 19 and 16% there carried out
cybersecurity vulnerability audits, penetration testing, invested in threat
intelligence, but the one I&rsquo;d stick to is the one in the middle in terms of
testing staff. Next one trends over time compared to 22. The deployment
of the various controls and procedures has fallen amongst businesses.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 09:33
And I&rsquo;ve highlighted that one towards the bottom there. The agreed
process for phishing emails is actually down from 57% to 48%. And notice
that there&rsquo;s 19% that use phishing exercises.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 09:51
So that&rsquo;s down if you move to the next one.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 09:53
Again, I&rsquo;ll highlight phishing because it is the biggest category there. So
this is the percentage that have identified the following types of breaches
or tax in the last twelve months among the organizations that have
identified any breach or tax. So if you just take those, forget all the others.
The highest and the biggest problem there.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 10:14
What&rsquo;S being stated is phishing attacks.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 10:17
The next one down is others impersonating organizations in email or
online. Now that&rsquo;s 31%, so you&rsquo;re going from 79 to 31, the second one
down. So that identifies how big a problem.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 10:32
In that respect phishing attacks are.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 10:35
Next, among the organizations identified any breach or tax,
approximately half of these business and 54% of charities say that they.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 10:44
Only experience phishing attacks and no other.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 10:47
Kind of breach or tax. This falls to a third amongst the largest businesses,
which is 33% and a similar proportion amongst the medium size.
Specifically medium and large organizations are more likely to report
phishing attacks, 93% of large businesses and 84% medium businesses
versus 79 of overall. That is quite a high percentage. Next, let&rsquo;s go to
percentage that report the foreign types of breaches or tax as the most
disruptive, including the organizations have only identified phishing
attacks in the last twelve months. That&rsquo;s 59 and 64. Again fairly high. And
the next one down is 35. And again, if you look at it&rsquo;s roughly not the
same, but the second one is in the 13. The point I&rsquo;m making there, what
constitute a crime? So this was quite interesting in the survey they define
what they&rsquo;re considered a crime. This survey covers multitude, so multiple
forms of cybercrime.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 11:46
Towards the bottom you got phishing attacks that individuals responded
to, for example by opening an attachment or that contained personal data
about the recipient and did not lead to any further crimes being
committed. But still they&rsquo;ve identified that as a crime.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 12:00
Now in the next section that they.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 12:02
Go through, and again, where fishing is.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 12:04
Mentioned, it covers all types of cybersecurity.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 12:08
Breaches or tax that resulted in a cybercrime. And it&rsquo;s worth noting that
most of the 11% of businesses and 8% of charities that identified
cybercrimes are referring to phishing related cybercrimes where
individuals responded. So again, those numbers there and the highlights
there because they do talk about.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 12:26
Phishing in a big way, the nature.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 12:29
Of the cybercrimes experience will obviously from the figures I&rsquo;ve shown
you, we&rsquo;re talking about phishing. Now the percentage of organizations
that have identified the following types of cybercrime in the last twelve
months amongst organizations. And again, this particular thing is slightly
different in terms of attacks. So you&rsquo;ve got fishing at the top, the next one
down. Most of you will remember that a couple of years ago ransomware
was the big thing and now we&rsquo;ve got viruses, spyware or malware. And
ransomware is way down as 4% compared to viruses, spyware, malware,
which is 12%. And phishing attacks is still way up.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 13:12
There at the top.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 13:14
Using these results from the breach server, this is what they estimate. So
70,000 non phishing crimes in the last twelve months. UK charities that&rsquo;s
in UK business, sorry, and UK charity, experienced approximately 785,000
cybercrimes of all sorts of all types in the last twelve months.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 13:34
So again, it is what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 13:39
Phishing is a major thing as far as NCSE are concerned. So some of the
other data that we&rsquo;ve got, I&rsquo;m going to quickly flash that through. And this
other data isn&rsquo;t about the crimes itself, it&rsquo;s what they did as a result of
what they found. So this particular chart is percentage of businesses and
charities that had any of the foreign outcomes among the organizations
that have identified breaches.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 14:09
So as a result of a response, what happened?</p><p>Speaker 3 - 14:13
And basically we&rsquo;re talking about 8% and 7% of charities whereby the
website or online services were taken down or made slower. So you&rsquo;re
going all the way down. So if you look at all these, some of these are quite
small as percentages, but keep that in mind because I&rsquo;m going to come
back to that. And this here is percentage that were impacted by any of the
following ways.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 14:37
Among the organizations that identified breaches, listed.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 14:41
Any impact, we&rsquo;re talking about 37 added staff. So as a result of that, they
added staff to staff time to deal with the breach itself. New measures were
needed for future tax to try and protect them. They stopped staff carrying
out daily work, other repairs.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 14:58
Now, in all of that, interestingly enough, it goes from a fairly sort of.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 15:05
Mediocre 37% down to 0%. And I will come back to these.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 15:09
Stats in a short while.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 15:11
So sensitive organizations have done any of the following since they&rsquo;re
most disrupted.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 15:16
So the highest thing there is whether they took action, and the action was.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 15:22
Staff training and communication.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 15:24
And we don&rsquo;t have the stats which.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 15:27
Say what staff training it was specifically whether it was around phishing
or whether it was normal awareness, maybe password training, maybe
something else, it&rsquo;s difficult to say, but it is staff training that they&rsquo;re
talking about and they&rsquo;re just talking about additional staff training. The
next thing is install changed or updated antivirus or malware solutions,
and that is nine and 6%. So we&rsquo;re going from 19 and 28 in the charities,
the top one, to slightly smaller numbers.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 15:58
Now this one here, I know it seems like a bit of a I.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 16:03
Chart and it is for me at my age, 57% of, sorry, percentage of
organizations have done any of the following since they&rsquo;re most disruptive,
the top thing there is changed or updated Firewall. Updated passwords
training comes down at 10%, there installed a changed updated
antimalware is third.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 16:23
But if you look at that, the.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 16:24
Fact that training is the third one down and that still comes out at 10%.
So they&rsquo;re doing lots and lots of.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 16:35
Different things, which is strange because it.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 16:38
Doesn&rsquo;T necessarily fit the story. And if we look at some of the key fishing
points from or, sorry, the key points around fishing from that survey, 19%
tested staff with mock phishing exercises. Businesses with agreed
processes went down from 57 to 48. 79% of business identified phishing
attacks as the top, as the number one. And yet phishing attacks was 93%
in large organization, 84 in medium, although it was 79 overall. And
phishing attacks is the number one most disruptive attack. And again, I&rsquo;ve
taken that figure from the different groups of charts that I showed you.
Yet they may not always know the complete outcome of an attack because
most of those showed in terms of the way that they responded, weren&rsquo;t
always sure what was the outcome and why they took a particular action.
So the impacts website changes or online services taken down or made
slower, which was 8%, and temporary loss of access to files and networks.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 17:46
So those are the sorts of impacts we&rsquo;re talking about. However, staff
training was down, was number one at 19% and changed an updated
firewall or system configuration was the next one.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 18:00
So not in the survey.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 18:03
Other surveys that I&rsquo;ve picked up talk about 91% of advanced cyber
attacks begin with some sort of an email. 81% of all malware attacks
come from phishing attempts. Email as an attack starting point continues
to work and it works because it works. Why would anyone change it?
Even if AI isn&rsquo;t used, phishing emails still give a return and a good return
without any issues. Phishing as a service seems to be thriving. Email
addresses are one of the cheapest marketing commodities around. Our
email addresses are sold from one organization to another, anyone can
buy them. And phishing responses are all seem to be about advice to users
and simulations. Responses which block too many emails are considered
to be too disruptive in many respects and have been for quite some time.
People say, oh, I was due to get an email, but it was blocked. Can you
unblock it, can you do this?</p><p>Speaker 3 - 19:03
And organizations find that quite disruptive as well.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 19:07
And the thing is, if you think.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 19:09
About it, criminals don&rsquo;t need to use AI. They can succeed and they can
carry on benefiting from what they&rsquo;re doing because we&rsquo;ve seen that it
works, it absolutely works from the NCSE statistics. But the thing is, if the
attackers.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 19:25
Started to use AI, it&rsquo;s an article.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 19:29
Earlier this year, March the 8th, talking about AI taking phishing attacks
to a whole new level of sophistication.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 19:36
So when they&rsquo;re getting this, what do.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 19:39
You think is going to be what do you think in your own organization?
We&rsquo;re going to be dealing with we&rsquo;re going to be dealing with the phishing
being a major disruptor already. In some respects it is, but it&rsquo;s perhaps
going to get even worse than it has been before. And the sorts of advice
that we&rsquo;ve been giving our users and I was amazed. The first two thing I
couldn&rsquo;t believe, I searched this online. I started to copy that down and I
thought to myself, I&rsquo;m going to include this, although it&rsquo;s nonsense. Avoid
phishing. How is that good advice? I pulled that off the internet when I
was doing searches for advice for reducing phishing. The advice for
reducing phishing is avoid phishing. Next one was be cautious about spam
emails to avoid phishing. So there&rsquo;s a whole bunch of things that we&rsquo;ve
said to people in the past and most of these I know I&rsquo;m guilty of.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 20:36
I have typos in my messages. Sometimes I send out messages that are
urgent and have typos. Some of them are attachments and I may be
asking somebody to do something, which is great, but I have grammar
issues. Sometimes Salutation may be wrong, there is no email address.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 20:56
All of those things that we give.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 20:59
Advice to ordinary users to figure out whether something is actually a
phishing message or not are the sort of things that everyone&rsquo;s guilty of and
we receive and we write messages with these sorts of things in them. I&rsquo;m
going to show something now. It&rsquo;s not my work, it&rsquo;s work of some security
people and I haven&rsquo;t got permission for it, but it is out on the internet. And
because it&rsquo;s out on the internet, I&rsquo;m using it.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 21:27
And basically I&rsquo;m using it to illustrate.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 21:31
How sophisticated the attacks are coming. And really the question that
was being asked in this chat on LinkedIn was what phishing templates do
you think is the most sneakiest? So really this was around phishing
simulations and this is around the idea and the people who did the work
on this. It&rsquo;s absolutely brilliant work. Nothing wrong with the work at all.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 21:54
But I just think that it is.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 21:57
Difficult for ordinary users. I find if I had to pull these things out and spot
these things in ordinary messages, I don&rsquo;t know if I could do it. So this one
here, it&rsquo;s vague, but how financial services make their decisions is never
predictable. Like most fishing, the impact of ignoring it is always dropped
into the message. Yes, absolutely.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 22:22
I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d be able.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 22:23
To respond to that in the right way and suss out that it could be fishing.
This one here, starting as it means to go on being direct and authoritative,
the window to act is clearly stated as it is. In fact, it&rsquo;s a requirement.
Again, simple thing, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 22:45
To pick it out.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 22:45
This one here.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 22:48
Maybe I should.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 22:49
Look, I&rsquo;m being curious, not nosy. Maybe you should, maybe you
shouldn&rsquo;t. Another one. These five, they are absolutely brilliant. And I can
imagine that AI could actually craft these in such a way that any security
person could possibly fall for these. And if not any, then at least ten to
15%. And that&rsquo;s probably all these people are looking for. In the worst
case, 5%.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 23:20
However, most of the phishing stats that.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 23:22
I&rsquo;ve read in the past is they&rsquo;re looking for returns of about 1%. Quite often
they&rsquo;re looking for small returns. And the thing is, AI is going to get better.
And what we&rsquo;re doing in our response to AI going into phishing and our
response to what&rsquo;s out there and what we&rsquo;re expecting people to do is
we&rsquo;re expecting our users, first of all, to remember every phishing
technique that we&rsquo;ve covered in the last few years in every email they read,
we want them to learn.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 23:49
Sorry, just a quick one. So those examples on the previous page, they were
created by an AI engine?</p><p>Speaker 3 - 23:57
No, this was crafted not by an AI agent. This was crafted by a company
that does user when it&rsquo;s training.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 24:04
Okay, cool. You can totally see how we&rsquo;re not that far off from taking that
and generating also, in fact, creating custom to the user, almost taking
into account the user and context, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>Speaker 3 - 24:16
Absolutely right. It&rsquo;s taking it the next level. So the point I&rsquo;m making here,
we&rsquo;re trying to get into spot techniques in every single email from fast
thinking to slow syncing. And we&rsquo;re asking them to do this for every single
email they get. And we&rsquo;re causing stress related sorry, skewed related
stress. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve heard that this is a term, I&rsquo;ve looked at some
research and how it&rsquo;s caused and all of that is causing our users to be non
compliant. And, and that causes a whole range of different types of
fatigue. And that fatigue may not hit them instantly, but these different
types of fatigue end up leading to ineffective user awareness outcomes.
That&rsquo;s not where we should be going. And the thing is, the reality is that
phishing isn&rsquo;t going to go away because it works. As I&rsquo;ve said earlier on, if
anything, it carries on working, it&rsquo;s going to increase, not decrease the
types of phishing has been and will continue to increase with the
technology and with the different types of sites and the services that we
get.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 25:19
There will be phishing emails that related to AI as well, that will claim to
be from AI that&rsquo;s identified something that you may have been looking for.
The number of emails everyone gets isn&rsquo;t going to go down. That&rsquo;s
increasing, especially because everything&rsquo;s going digital. Whether you
want points for your shopping, whether you want to set up an account
with a shopping site. No matter what you look at. Everything we do now,
even communication with our council, everything, expects you to give up
an email address of yours. The inventiveness of attackers will get better.
And when it comes to target attacks, yes, they will be using AI. Why
wouldn&rsquo;t they be using AI? Not that they have to, is what I said earlier on.
Targeted attacks are the hardest to train against. How are we going to
train? I mean, we&rsquo;ve given five examples there, and they were put together
by smart people who do anti malware sorry, anti phishing training.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 26:18
And they are going to get smart and they&rsquo;re going to be customized. And I
guess really what I&rsquo;m trying to get to is when we reach the breaking point
of relying on our.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 26:28
Users to do this sort of thing.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 26:32
While we&rsquo;re actually slowing them down in their productivity and the cost
of all these things, it might seem like it&rsquo;s fairly straightforward. Training
people, monthly costs or updates, train people, update phishing. This is the
latest thing. This is what you need to look out for. Could be five to ten
minutes a month. Simulations on that, five to ten. So if you add the two
together, let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s ten to 20,000 users, that&rsquo;s ten to 20,000 minutes a
year, which is about 167 to 333 hours, which comes down to between 22
to 44 days. And if we average it to a month, that&rsquo;s about 5000 pounds on
average salary. That doesn&rsquo;t seem that expensive. And the cost of training
and simulations could be anything from three to 20 pounds per user per
month, which would be anything from 36 up to seems okay in some
respects to many people.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 27:24
But what we&rsquo;re not thinking about is the hidden costs and the impacts of
phishing responsibilities onto our users. The fact that we&rsquo;re putting these
responsibilities, they&rsquo;re changing from what&rsquo;s? Normal fast thinking to
slow syncing. Whether they expect to have the conversation via an email
with someone or not is irrelevant because it could be new, it could be
existing conversation. Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s still a cost to have to think about
whether or not this is that same or not same conversation and that cost of
disruption to users. And the more messages they get, the greater the total
cost per day per user of that disruption in the way that their brains are
working, in the way that they&rsquo;re thinking. So user interface design realized
that even using the wrong colors has an impact on interrupting the user
flow.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 28:12
And the strange thing is, if user.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 28:14
Interface design is the same, why except why do we not understand that
we are absolutely interrupting the flow of productivity? And the extra cost
of that, I really think are absolutely astronomical if were to try and
calculate them. I did try and do some calculations before for this
presentation, but I thought they may be too wide.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 28:36
And without some academic sort of rigor.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 28:41
It&rsquo;S going to be meaningless. So I will move this particular presentation.
I&rsquo;m not towards the end yet, but I will try and get to a point where I can
present those the impacts of these things. So regardless of all this training,
fishing is still the number one impact of crime. So yes, there&rsquo;s been
simulations going on, yes, there&rsquo;s been user training. And regardless of all
that, we&rsquo;ve still got phishing as a number one thing. So since phishing is a
major disruption, let&rsquo;s assume that because too many phishing emails get
through, we can either spend more time teaching people how to interrupt
their workflow by thinking slow and thinking through the simulation
training, or we can spend more on technology to reduce them in getting
through in the first place. And we do need to start thinking differently. We
need to sort of start figuring out the human error is the single source of
breaches is what we hear so often, yet all of our staff are also considered
to be our best defense.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 29:42
So really we should be thinking about what is that humans do so badly,
what is it they&rsquo;re bad at, what is it they&rsquo;re good at? And in terms of our
defenses and being the largest source of the breaches, users should focus
on things that AI can&rsquo;t do and things that they can do. Because at the
moment, we know for a fact that AI cannot do the work that we do.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 30:05
That&rsquo;s a fact right there.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 30:07
It&rsquo;s not a surprise. So without AI in phishing tools, we know that rules
based technologies work if we can pick out the latest things that our users
should be looking out for. And I find that amazing that there&rsquo;s so many
anti phishing solutions out there. And yet, although there&rsquo;s so many
antifishing solutions out there, the volume of phishing simulations from
what I think the first anti phishing simulation tool I came across was
about 2008, 2009, and there was one company, and I forget the name, and
it was the only one. And I remember speaking to them several times on
improvements that they couldn&rsquo;t should be making. And that was 1415
years ago and that was the simulation. So in terms of where we&rsquo;ve got to
from there to now, so many things have changed.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 30:56
And with all of those things, if our experts can pick out what it.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 31:02
Is that we need to be looking out for, why is it we can&rsquo;t stick those into
rules and stop it so that we don&rsquo;t have to train our people to start looking
for these sorts of things? And AI is smarter, it absolutely is smarter than all
users when it&rsquo;s been taught the techniques. Dennis&rsquo;s presentation showed
that if it&rsquo;s been taught, has a list of enterprise specific rules in terms of
phishing, whatever rules the enterprise has got, if it&rsquo;s got a list of
registered domains. And the reason that&rsquo;s a good one is. I know that their
solutions and the way that they work and why that sort of thing is
important is it will stop users clicking on any domain that was registered
in the last day, week, month, whatever it might be that you want to set
your controls to. And I know that phishing emails rose a couple of years
ago when COVID started, and NCSE did say at that time when went into
lockdown, that they noticed a range, an extra couple of thousand domain
names being registered at that time and they start to be used.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 32:07
So they were registered and they were used within a very short space of
time for lots and lots of things. And again, you can use these sorts of tools.
So it&rsquo;s not that complex in adding these things in. We need to be reducing
user thought, action and response in terms of fatigue. We need to limit
what people need to know to very extreme small set of messages because
this is a disruption from the work that they are there to do. We need to
limit what they need to do about messages other than the work they need
to do to get things done. We need to keep tasks that should be performed
by technology separately from those that should be performed by humans,
and actively looking for ways to help them become more aware by having
less to do in response. In training, they always talk about three things that
you need to focus on three things.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 33:00
And really we&rsquo;re talking about anti phishing simulations covering lots and
us as users having to remember all these things. I really don&rsquo;t like having
to remember all these different things myself as a user, what they have to
do, what do users have to do, and whatever it is that they need to do, it
should be clear, it should be simple, it should be quick, they shouldn&rsquo;t have
to think about it. But at the moment, with all the different techniques,
they&rsquo;re having to think a lot outside their comfort zone. So remember, our
users are not there for us, they&rsquo;re not our human firewall, and they are
there to add value to the business, not because we can&rsquo;t be bothered to
find better phishing. Blockers if your border firewall was broken down,
would you expect your users to replace it and would you expect them to
deal with so if they wouldn&rsquo;t, why would we expect them to deal with
phishing?</p><p>Speaker 3 - 33:51
It&rsquo;s similar sorts of thing, because the onslaught of, I guess, traffic that we
used to get when we first started to implement Firewalls is the same as it
is now when we&rsquo;re talking about phishing emails that we get messages,
email messages have been growing similar to the sort of responses that
brought our firewalls into place. And if the users are smart, sorry.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 34:17
AI.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 34:20
Is not smart enough to do the work. Our users are smart enough to do the
work. And we should make our users think slow. Sorry, making our users
think slow is they&rsquo;re losing battle in the long term. And I think that we will
get to a point where the number of phishing messages we get, it&rsquo;s not
going to be very good. So, question are our users smarter than AI? Yes,
they are. They&rsquo;re infinitely smart than AI because AI couldn&rsquo;t do their jobs
by a long shot. But let&rsquo;s help by reducing the total decisions that users
have to make or think about so they can get on and doing the jobs that
only they can do. AI should be able to do the other things.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 34:56
So AI, our users are not smart.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 34:59
In AI because they cannot analyze loads and loads of different messages
and loads of things in a short space of time in a way that I said I&rsquo;m not as
smart as AI. AI can do loads of things that we cannot do. And if AI that
you&rsquo;re using isn&rsquo;t good enough, we should be offloading the work that AI
cannot do off to our users. Because so far many organizations, the way
that they&rsquo;re using phishing simulations, we&rsquo;re actually doing exactly that.
We should be keeping our messages focused on the most important things
that our users can&rsquo;t do. And if your AI can&rsquo;t do it, complain to your vendor,
find another vendor, don&rsquo;t transfer the action of the risk response onto our
users.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 35:43
That&rsquo;s it.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 35:43
I&rsquo;ll stop there. And that&rsquo;s the end of my presentation.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 35:47
I will stop.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 35:50
Can you expand on that last point? I think it&rsquo;s quite interesting. Can you
expand on your last point on shifting the things to the AI, to the users?
Because it&rsquo;s quite an interesting point.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 36:05
Yeah.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 36:06
Can you go like some examples?</p><p>Speaker 3 - 36:10
What I&rsquo;m saying is I&rsquo;ve searched the number and I tried deliberately not to
point to any single vendor. But there are whole bunch of claim to have
really good AI. Now, a year ago I would have laughed anyone that said
that to me. And it has been getting better and it will get better, but we&rsquo;re
not there yet. But it&rsquo;s certainly better than lying on our users. The number
of vendors that claim to do this has been growing, especially with AI get it
getting better. So I&rsquo;m just talking about any aspect. I think we need to
focus on giving our users time back in any way that we can. If phishing
simulations is part of it and we do it slowly, then that&rsquo;s fine. If it&rsquo;s not, we
need to think about our own organization. Some of the things that I&rsquo;ve
done in the past in terms of the question you&rsquo;ve asked me is we&rsquo;ve started
to in some places I&rsquo;ve worked at.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 37:06
What we start to do was rather than use blanket simulations, we start to.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 37:11
Look at specific users that we think are going to be high risk and those
that are much low risk. Those that we think are high risk. We give them
specific ones sort of things that they&rsquo;ll encounter, other people, other
things that they&rsquo;ll encounter. And I know that many people say they
already are doing this. I think what we need to do is where we are still
doing it is to do it as fine Tuningly as if were actually fishing ourselves
with that target group. Many of the fishing exercise I&rsquo;ve seen and some
people complain about is that they have blanket fishing. Things really take
up too much of their time and what they learn from them is not much
because basically, as I&rsquo;ve said, we still have the same phishing problem
we&rsquo;ve always had.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 37:53
Yeah, that makes sense. Actually, I guess an interesting evolution of this is
that, and I don&rsquo;t think we that far off is when we actually start to get the
AIS to read our email, right, to basically start cleaning up. And they might
actually be quite effective, even if just trimming saying, look, based on
your history, based on your analysis, especially when it comes customized,
this is the one that matters, the ones that don&rsquo;t matter. And this one is a bit
weird.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 38:20
Why is that.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 38:22
As good as that? As you say, instead of blocking them and I&rsquo;m saying
blocking the first instance because it just sounds easier. But what the AI
does is messages come to you exactly what you said they point out, say
look, this message come from this person and the CFO but it seems like
it&rsquo;s come from a Gmail address. Are you expecting it? So they basically
highlight the things that you need that are different and you make the
decision. And if you make the wrong decision, that is totally okay. But
what you&rsquo;re not doing is spending thinking slow and thinking fast, doing
normal work to something that&rsquo;s a chore, that security people expect you
to do as a result of the training that they&rsquo;ve given you.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 39:01
Yeah, and I guess one of the ways I will scale is because a lot of sometimes
the detection is done at the edge where they don&rsquo;t have context. Where the
more the models understand, your inbox understand, like I said, your
relationships, the graphs and maybe able to be a lot more effective. And
then in a weird way maybe we can actually start to have somer tooling
talking to each other where we can say hey, imagine a world where in that
moment in time the crew and EDR tools that you have in the device go
hey, by the way, pay attention because something bad might be happening.
A lot of tools, sometimes they cannot do as much as they could because of
performance. Right. It&rsquo;s kind of like a lot of our security models that we
could be very focused on some activity, but that brings everything down.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 39:47
But if you know that you&rsquo;re only doing it for a small period of time or
when it&rsquo;s a bit more dangerous. Yeah, so that integration is again, I think
that context, that is starting to be possible now, where even five or six
months ago, I couldn&rsquo;t really see how we&rsquo;re going to get to that level of
automation.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 40:06
To replace that or to respond to that. I guess my techniques that I&rsquo;ve
always.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 40:12
Used everywhere I&rsquo;ve went, because you never.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 40:15
Know, and you move around a lot, you never know what techniques or
what tools are going to be in place. So you techniques yourself and
approaches that work for you no matter where you go. So for me, what I
do is my inbox. Anything that&rsquo;s important, that&rsquo;s critical, where I have to
pay attention, that where I might be fished. What I do is I create folders
that work for me, and I automatically create a rule using my email client
that will move that if it&rsquo;s from that user into another folder. And if I get an
email from that person that stays in the inbox.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 40:49
Itself, that means there&rsquo;s something wrong with it.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 40:53
It hasn&rsquo;t moved. Little things like that, which we all have techniques, and
we shouldn&rsquo;t have to figure out these techniques. We should be able to
have a single inbox. Everything is sorted by itself, by the AI, by our AI
email clients, which points to us all those things that we&rsquo;ve just been
talking about.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 41:15
Yeah, no, that&rsquo;s a cool technique and yeah, looking forward to having I
manage my email bots a little bit over the place at the moment.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 41:25
I&rsquo;m going to develop this a bit further. So a couple of months time, I may
do another one related to this. But the next stage of where I think it&rsquo;s gone
and where I think it&rsquo;s going to be useful, because I think this is what I&rsquo;m
very.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 41:37
Interested in is user behavior and how.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 41:41
Users take on our relationship with security.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 41:45
But the one that I told you we really want to expand is on the users as
human sensors. And actually, if you look at the Kneban framework, that
world, there&rsquo;s a lot of I think those guys I think it was Snowden, david
Snowden. Dave Snowden. If you look at the work he&rsquo;s done, he came to
one of the summit, actually, and did some really cool stuff, but he kind of
had this Knebbing framework, and a lot of it is about human sensors. So
he expanded on he thinks about complex and think chaos, complex orders
and something else for a while. But yeah, check it out, because I think it&rsquo;s
quite interesting. But I really like that human sensors concept where in a
way, we should be looking at users as our best assets. One of the messages
that we try to push, but it&rsquo;s always a bit hard, but I try to encourage even
the users is that what I would have an issue is if the user don&rsquo;t let us know,
right?</p><p>Speaker 2 - 42:49
Like, if the user sees something and don&rsquo;t let us know, even if they do
something and don&rsquo;t let us know means we lose a lot of time. Like, for
example, if they send the email to the wrong person, think initially the user
might go, oh, let me see if I&rsquo;m in trouble, where actually I almost want to
turn the pivot around and say, look, you are only in trouble if you don&rsquo;t tell
us. If you tell us, we could do something about it. We don&rsquo;t want to be
catching it at the other end. Not that the user should be in trouble, but I
think we need to create this culture of the human senses and they should
be empowered and we should have the ability to process the data because
it means that we&rsquo;re going to get a lot more data, we&rsquo;re going to get a lot
more false positives.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 43:24
But I much prefer the users to be triggered happy than trigger unhappy,
where when they do something that maybe it&rsquo;s a bit weird, they don&rsquo;t
acknowledge it and they don&rsquo;t raise suspicious. So that means we can&rsquo;t
calibrate the thing.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 43:39
And there has been some research done and I mentioned it and I&rsquo;ve read.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 43:42
Quite a bit around users getting fatigued as a result of all the different
things they have to do and what.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 43:52
Makes them respond in the right way, what makes them respond in the
wrong way. So there has been some research done in the UK as well, and
it&rsquo;s moving forward and there is beginning to be more and more work
done, because, I don&rsquo;t know if you know, but the number of universities
that are now doing Masters and PhDs in cyber has been growing over the
last seven, eight years. And it&rsquo;s fantastic. It&rsquo;s really good. And some of the
things that they look at are users, not just the side beside of things that
you and I may be interested in. And they&rsquo;re looking at stress and stress it&rsquo;s
causing users. So it&rsquo;s all very exciting stuff.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 44:29
Yeah, cool.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 44:30
All right, man, brilliant. I just checked, there&rsquo;s no questions, so this is all
good. We wrap it up and I&rsquo;ll see you on the next one. Brilliant.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 44:36
Take care, speak to you soon.
