That is available in Linux/Unix (kernel) from decade. In this topic, will explore the layers, isolation, privileges, environments/resource utilization etc for a Linux process and use the same as container/isolated env. Also will discuss the security concerns regarding why not Docker. It will help students, working professionals to understand the concepts of Linux kernel namespace and kernel level privileges for containerization.</description></item><item><title>Security Design &amp; Guidance at scale</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/feb/governance/security-design-guidance-at-scale/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/feb/governance/security-design-guidance-at-scale/</guid><description>About this session In a cloud-native, agile environment with hundreds of services operating at scale for products, security needs to be comprehensive, data driven and focuses on risk reduction. How does a lean team of security engineers achieve this with an emphasis on trust and partnership? In this presentation, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover my learnings as a security engineer working on security design and guidance at scale. The talk will mainly focus on three things: 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
