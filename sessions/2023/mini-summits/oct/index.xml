&lt;p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, the relationship between developers and application security is paramount. Yet, too often, these two entities operate in silos, leading to overlooked vulnerabilities and missed opportunities for innovation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this session, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The Empathy Connection: Drawing parallels from UX/UI, we&amp;rsquo;ll delve into understanding the mindset of developers, demonstrating how application security teams can harness humanistic behaviorism to foster enhanced collaboration.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AppSec Threats Deserve Their Own Incident Response Plan</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/devsecops/appsec-threats-deserve-their-own-incident-response-plan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/devsecops/appsec-threats-deserve-their-own-incident-response-plan/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Despite the popularity of AppSec related incidents, most organizations do not have an incident response plan in place. Those that do have an IR playbook, often prepare to respond to infra-related attacks such as ransomware, rather than app. Attacks. Given the prevalence of these attacks, this presentation will provide a quick response playbook and review the characteristics that make AppSec IR deserving of its own plan.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In an era where cyber threats evolve at an unprecedented pace, traditional methods of incident response testing often fall short. This presentation introduces &amp;ldquo;AttackGen&amp;rdquo;, a groundbreaking tool that seamlessly integrates the MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK framework with state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). Attendees will be taken on a journey from a live demonstration of AttackGen&amp;rsquo;s capabilities to a deeper exploration of its mechanics. The talk will culminate with a broader discussion on the transformative potential of LLMs in cybersecurity, exploring how they can be harnessed for tasks ranging from threat intelligence to code scanning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ChatGPT and GenAI Privacy - Massive Uncertainty and Massive Opportunity</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/devsecops/chatgp-and-genai-privacy-massive-uncertainty-and-massive-opportunity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/devsecops/chatgp-and-genai-privacy-massive-uncertainty-and-massive-opportunity/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Posture and Data don’t lie - risk and fact-driven approach on posture management with deep dive into exploitability, reliability and the likelihood of exploitation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Posture is the art of representing complex problems in simple risk-based visualization. Risk posture had a lot of hidden measurements and data and was treated like esoteric art. In this talk, we explore various concepts like Exploitation, the likelihood of exploitability, Context and location of an asset and how it influences the exploitability, business impact and how to involve business with risk-based driven metrics.
The talk focus on data-driven research and visualisation techniques analysing what’s more exploitable from different data sources.
We will explore the difference between a vulnerability base approach and resolution first vs a risk-based approach and success from real case scenarios.

You. Hi. Welcome to this open security summit session in October 2023.
And we&amp;rsquo;re joined by Simon Wardley and Marius Poskus. You know, has to
be one of my favorite topics, especially, I have to say, the thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned
the most in the last 510 years that changed my perception. I have to add
Gen AI to that now. I have to say, Simon, but, you know, I still feel that it&amp;rsquo;s
one of those unexplored areas that has so much that we need to do to
figure out how to really use it. And it&amp;rsquo;s not perfect, but it&amp;rsquo;s way better than
a lot of the things that we use. So big fan on worldly maps. So, Simon, I
know you got some things you want to present to us. Why don&amp;rsquo;t we start
there and then we start the Q A out of it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Protect Your Application, Not Just the Network.

Hi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dinis Cruz - 00:03
Welcome to this open Security Summit in October 2023. And we have
Lewis for the part three or Thread Modeling Qatar, which is a really
amazing concept that a lot of people should be following because it&amp;rsquo;s all
about practicing, trying these things and getting a lot of amazing
momentum. So, Louis, over to you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Zero Trust Architecture: Strengthening Cloud Security Posture (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/devsecops/zero-trust-architecture-strengthening-cloud-security-posture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/devsecops/zero-trust-architecture-strengthening-cloud-security-posture/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This topic focuses on the implementation of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) in cloud environments. It examines the principles and best practices of ZTA, including micro-segmentation, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and continuous monitoring, to enhance security in a cloud-centric ecosystem.&lt;/p>
