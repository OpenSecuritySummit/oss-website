Yet, too often, these two entities operate in silos, leading to overlooked vulnerabilities and missed opportunities for innovation.
In this session, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore:
The Empathy Connection: Drawing parallels from UX/UI, we&amp;rsquo;ll delve into understanding the mindset of developers, demonstrating how application security teams can harness humanistic behaviorism to foster enhanced collaboration.</description></item><item><title>AppSec Threats Deserve Their Own Incident Response Plan</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/devsecops/appsec-threats-deserve-their-own-incident-response-plan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/oct/devsecops/appsec-threats-deserve-their-own-incident-response-plan/</guid><description>About this session Despite the popularity of AppSec related incidents, most organizations do not have an incident response plan in place. Those that do have an IR playbook, often prepare to respond to infra-related attacks such as ransomware, rather than app. Attacks. Given the prevalence of these attacks, this presentation will provide a quick response playbook and review the characteristics that make AppSec IR deserving of its own plan.
