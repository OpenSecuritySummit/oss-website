It examines techniques for detecting and responding to security incidents in production environments, including log analysis, anomaly detection, and incident response automation.
Outline: Introduction to shift-right security and its significance in DevSecOps Monitoring and analyzing production logs for security insights Techniques for anomaly detection and behavior-based security monitoring Incident response automation and remediation strategies Collaboration between development, operations, and security teams for effective incident response</description></item></channel></rss>
