You.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 00:08
Want us to start or how does that work?</p><p>Speaker 1 - 00:13
Yeah, welcome to this session and over to you.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 00:16
Just give a quick introduction the topic and the participants and then take
this very important topic. I can say a few words to start just but anybody
else can. Yeah, not pushing free. I think the topic is overlapping with the
topic of how does cybersecurity talk to management or how does a CISO
talk to the executive team. Here is a bit more specific because based on
the headline we&rsquo;re talking about the risk professionals, but in principle
talking to executive I would imagine is the executive team or could even be
the board, depending on the situation because the board has typically risk
responsibility. So it probably is a two level thing. One is the executive side
and the other one is the board.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 01:18
And to launch a bit as a discussion and to make it a bit kind of black and
white where we can paint the gray levels later is what I noticed in my
consulting practice is that many CISOs or many senior guys or even risk
professionals are typically even the CISOs are very technical in many ways
and because most of the problems they have to solve are very technical
sometimes they are part of it, sometimes they&rsquo;re separate from it.
Sometimes they report to the CFO or to someone. They are maybe one
layer or two layer away from the executive management team. And they
are very often, most of them, very technical. And so one of the big
challenges is to talk the same language between these two sites.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 02:24
One, the executive management does not understand the technical things,
the technical guys doesn&rsquo;t understand the management things. So we have
to find a way to talk the same language. And I think generally speaking,
the first step is for the cybersecurity or the risk professionals to acquire a
bit of management know how. I think especially security costs a lot more
these days. We have to behave like any other department in a company
having management know how, talking the same language, understanding
the way the company is managed independently of technical area is one
very big thing. The other thing is clearly education of the executive, maybe
a topic by itself. What is practical, what is acceptable on that height
depends a bit on the style of the companies, the small company, medium
sized company, MNC, what does it mean?</p><p>Speaker 2 - 03:32
I think that&rsquo;s what I would say, just to get the discussion going a bit
general, but we can go in the specific aspect.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 03:44
I&rsquo;m happy to just pick up on that. I think you make some very good points
there and I completely agree that there is an issue around finding common
language. One thing that I would throw out there is that I&rsquo;ve always felt
that one of the issues is that boards, for example, think that cybersecurity
is essentially a technology or an It conversation and they don&rsquo;t identify
that as being an area where they have expertise. And when you&rsquo;re on a
board or you are a senior exec, you don&rsquo;t really like to show your
vulnerabilities and lack of knowledge. So particularly when it&rsquo;s going
down a specialist route, then actually that essentially means that they
probably don&rsquo;t contribute as much as they would want to because they
don&rsquo;t want to showcase that lack of knowledge or that vulnerability.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 04:36
And I think that part of the issue is that cybersecurity from a board
perspective, for example, or an exco perspective, is not an It conversation,
it&rsquo;s not a technology conversation, it&rsquo;s a risk management conversation.
And when you change the chip in a lot of these individuals, where you say
to them, maxine, it&rsquo;s a risk management conversation, and you would
happily contribute to risk management in pretty much every area of the
business, regardless. Whether you have expertise or not, then apply the
same level of know how and general management skill set, et cetera, that
you would have in any risk management conversation and kind of go from
there. And like a very practical example for me is you want to protect the
crown jewels of your organization from a cybersecurity perspective.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 05:22
Everybody wants that now the cybersecurity team or the security team will
be able to do that, but they&rsquo;re not the ones who should decide what the
crown jewels are. That really is a decision for the board or for XCO. So
that is a good example for me where you have risk management as a sort
of overlay and then you figure out what you can contribute towards that
conversation and then you have different parts playing a role.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 05:44
I think one item, and I&rsquo;m sorry.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 05:49
That was the end of my mind.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 05:50
I think some of you and I&rsquo;m not sure which industries you are working, so
it may be a little bit different. Some of you who are at least in EU will be
who are for example, in the financial industry will fall under Dora
regulation soon. Normally that&rsquo;s end of 2024, beginning 2025. And Dora
specifies that the supervisor, the management body, which is basically both
the executive team and the board, have to have the proper know how. And
I was facing even regulators a year back which in their audits brought up
the point that the management needs to have the know how, needs to be
involved, needs to take the time. And that&rsquo;s one thing. So I think the topic
of it&rsquo;s no longer possible, at least for senior management to get away.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 06:44
It&rsquo;s now kind of black and white in some ways and some of them because
of that or the future or the present, have chosen to get also advisors. The
board can have an advisor because it&rsquo;s a bit independent on cybersecurity
to help it in some ways. That&rsquo;s one thing. The second thing is one of the
problem is that security guys, sometimes they report to CIO or not.
Sometimes even the CIO is not part of the executive team. So there is a
number of topics, not only cybersecurity topics, which are not necessarily
well understood, even at executive team level, depending on the company
to throw more oil to the.</p><p>Speaker 4 - 07:34
So I would like to add a few things on this. So first of all, my name is
Matric, I&rsquo;m a technical architect. I&rsquo;m working for one of the largest MSP
providers in Oxford, in the UK. And that&rsquo;s what our job is on a daily basis,
just to speak to obviously executives and the right people within the
industry. And as Guill and Danny said, I think it&rsquo;s important to us to make
sure that we&rsquo;re speaking to those executives, to the people who are
actually making the decision, because security, data protection and all of
those things that we&rsquo;re talking about, they actually start from the top. So
obviously, people that we&rsquo;re speaking to, they need to decide whether they
want to go for the changes within their business and that&rsquo;s where it starts
from.</p><p>Speaker 4 - 08:24
So I think it&rsquo;s quite important, as Danny, as you mentioned, speaking to
the right people at the top of the organization because we know that it
won&rsquo;t start from down and then obviously everything starts from the top
and the main decisions are being made at the top. So this is why this is so
important to speak to someone who&rsquo;s actually making those decisions.
Plus, obviously, as we all know, and you can probably all agree that we live
in a crazy world at the moment, where data needs to be super protected.
Because with all of those SaaS solutions and everything, we actually keep
the data everywhere and we need to have the right solutions to make sure
that the data is protected, right?</p><p>Speaker 4 - 09:07
I think the main point is just to make sure that we&rsquo;re speaking to someone
at the top of the chain who is making those decisions.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 09:20
I think sometimes there&rsquo;s a few things I think sometimes overlooked when
we&rsquo;re talking about, there&rsquo;s a lot of talking about CISO has to be
technical. But at the same time, I think one thing that&rsquo;s overlooked more
often than not is the soft skills. Because when you land yourself in a CISO
position, the first thing and foremost you should get to know your
executive team. So you have to align your communication style, whether
someone&rsquo;s technical, whether someone&rsquo;s managerial, how do you deliver
your risk communication across various parts of the C suite? So you need
to know how you can present stuff that they will understand, align those
communication lines, align their knowledge and their perspectives. The
first thing I think, when you get to meet them, ask what&rsquo;s keeping them up
at night, what kind of risks are in their particular area.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 10:17
Because when you get the buy in and you can deliver value to executives,
then you can build those communication lines and actually get something
done.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 10:25
I think what&rsquo;s happening also is that some CSOs and risk professionals,
sometimes it&rsquo;s not only the same common language and sort of make it
clear, but there are other things which are lacking. The senior guy, the
executive, may ask you, so where&rsquo;s your security strategy? Do you have a
document explaining where you want to go? Do you have a roadmap? Do
you have any KPIs? Do you have metrics? We can see every monthly
update on the risks. How are the metrics and the KPI you&rsquo;re doing and
where you&rsquo;re going in the future? I think it&rsquo;s a kind of a mix of things
which are typical for a management discussion. There&rsquo;s nothing unique for
security, but this is what they would ask anybody who would bring up
something of interest.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 11:18
In some ways, I think these instruments or these elements, we must have to
fit in the management, let&rsquo;s say logic in something.</p><p>Speaker 4 - 11:32
That&rsquo;s why actually.</p><p>Speaker 5 - 11:36
Well, I totally in agreement with all that have been said so far. I mean,
based on my experience, I mean, working with the executives from a
governance, a GRC perspective. So based on the challenges that I&rsquo;ve
actually encountered dealing with the powers that be within this
organization as it relates to risk communication, I have actually been able
to develop a strategic approach to actually dealing with this challenge
based on the fact that, as you have rightly said, the executives have a
particular mindset they think a certain way. So in order to deal with this, I
normally approach this from a more strategic point of view. And I&rsquo;ve
actually developed a particular, I would say maybe a system that I
normally use to deal with this sort of a situation. Normally, I would, for
example, ask I need to first understand how do executives think?</p><p>Speaker 5 - 12:33
What is it that they are thinking about in their boardroom? How do they
actually process? What are they communicating? What are the
conversations that they have within these boardroom conversations? And
then I need to understand, for example, how it is that the business
generates revenue. I mean, the bottom line, what is it that&rsquo;s actually
contributing most to the organization, and in terms of what perspective do
they have on risk? So with that alignment, with that understanding, then
I&rsquo;m able to align what it is that I&rsquo;m communicating with their overall
business activities within that organization. So that is the way that I&rsquo;ve
actually been able to proactively or positively been able to work with the
executives to get them along, as you say, in terms of buying and
understanding better from a cybersecurity perspective, risk perspective.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 13:32
And can I just building on that, based on that experience, do you feel that
you add as much value to them as they add value to you? Is it a real 50 52
way or is it more you&rsquo;re adding more value all the other way around? How
would you see it?</p><p>Speaker 5 - 13:51
Well, I would say depending well, based on the environments that I&rsquo;ve
actually been in, I have actually worked along.</p><p>Speaker 4 - 13:59
It depends.</p><p>Speaker 5 - 14:01
You have people that are really quite receptive. You have those that are
like they could care less as to what I mean, at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s all
about they making generating revenue. But I think it all depends. Based
on my experience, it varies. At times it&rsquo;s a 50, at times it&rsquo;s more of maybe a
60 30. So that&rsquo;s where the challenge is. I have to bridge that gap to create
that alignment, to ensure that they&rsquo;re actually achieving. We&rsquo;re all on the
same wavelength in terms of meeting business objectives.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 14:30
Yeah, I think also what you need is not all the executives. There may be, of
course, the CEO, the managing director, or the board, the chairman of the
board, and so on. Of course there&rsquo;s a collection of individuals. All these
individuals have different roles and their risk appetite is actually different
and what they want in life is very different. So it&rsquo;s also you have to
understand a bit, if you can and you said talking to them also helps to
understand the politics going on. Maybe for one, you are one who is
saving his job because to avoid that, we have a breach. For the other one,
you are basically a cost factor which has to be minimized. The other 1
may think that you could possibly disrupt the processes of the company or
something.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 15:20
I think using any opportunity to expose yourself, to work with them, to
understand them better, to find the right angle and the right not only
language but also political angle is really important. I think that&rsquo;s the
same amongst themselves for other topics. It&rsquo;s not unique to cybersecurity.
You have to navigate also but sorry.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 15:49
Just briefly, I think the issue there though, is that&rsquo;s when you&rsquo;ve got a
problem, right, when you&rsquo;re working with a board or an exco that has an
individualistic approach to what they&rsquo;re hoping cybersecurity is going to
be. And I think ideally, just based on what we have heard so far, the whole
point is that you have to work with the board to educate them and create
that 50 relationship to make sure that there&rsquo;s only one mission and then
everybody&rsquo;s working to the same mission. Because I think what you just
said is so true. If you&rsquo;re a cost concern for one and you&rsquo;re a savior for
another, then how are you going to be able to bring everybody together?
But if you have one mission that embodies everybody, then you&rsquo;ve got
something you can work.</p><p>Speaker 4 - 16:31
I think if I could elaborate on this one also, I like what actually Marius
said once. We need to find that simple language first to speak to someone,
because obviously the executives within the companies, they may not be
technical. I mean, they don&rsquo;t need to be technical and we just need to find
the language essentially to create the documents. I mean, one of the
techniques that we&rsquo;re using and the company that I work for is we write
those documents like strategies for the companies. And this is a
nontechnical language first just to approach that conversation with those
executives. And then obviously later on we&rsquo;ll explain to know in technical
matters why this is important and things like that.</p><p>Speaker 4 - 17:13
But it&rsquo;s really important to at least at the beginning, if you know that
you&rsquo;re speaking, as Marius said, to someone who is not technical, just to
explain know why this is important and just the simplest language as
possibly can be so they can understand the risks.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 17:29
Yeah, I think one thing that sometimes is missing when we start
communicating risk to the board the great way, and when you obviously
build on those soft skills, you become a storyteller because obviously most
of the executives, all they care about is the bottom line. So how can you
relate your risk mitigation tactics that it delivers to the business bottom
line? Because sometimes as security professionals, tend to talk about
specific critical risks, but that does not mean anything to them unless it
relates to bottom line and business goals and business direction. So I think
that&rsquo;s key in how you can create and craft your storytelling into that it
delivers to the business bottom line.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 18:17
Adding to that, in the past I came across many people who got the
attention of the executives by fear, if we don&rsquo;t do this, we&rsquo;re going to die.
That I think, is okay. You can use that once or twice, but you cannot use
that as your typical model. You have to go beyond that. I think
understanding where you come in, where this particular risk impacts
production, where it impacts customer satisfaction, where it impacts
financial things, talking that language over time is the better way. The fear
works a little bit at the beginning. But I think also what I see is that most,
and that may help in this discussion, most executives actually, or at least
most senior guys in the executives, they are aware that things go wrong.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 19:09
If things go wrong, they are going to be in the front line, they&rsquo;re going to
be visible. Yeah. So I think they are nervous these days. I think that was
not the case two or three years ago. I think these days they are aware that
it is their job or they are involved in either avoidance and also solving the
problem and so on. And I think what they have in their mind is are we
doing the right thing in this company? That&rsquo;s what they have in their mind,
or are we investing enough? And so on. Have we understood what&rsquo;s going
on? They may not be tested technical specialists, but all the executives
typically are very smart guys. They may not be deep technical, but they
certainly can ask the right questions. Up to us to be able to sort of feed
them.</p><p>Speaker 5 - 20:04
I totally agree with you there. I&rsquo;m actually seeing a shift where as you
mentioned rightly, that the executives are no longer archaic in terms of
what they think. They are no more abreast with cybersecurity happenings.
They see the various breaches incidents, the impact to the organization.
So as you have rightly said, they are thinking about RVC, what can we do?
So I normally take the advantage of that to build a relationship. That&rsquo;s
one of my things that I normally do. To try to build a strong relationship
as best as possible wherever I can to ensure that we are actually
communicating.</p><p>Speaker 5 - 20:46
So once we have that trust, we have that relationship where possible, then
it&rsquo;s easier for me to actually communicate and bring the importance of
ensuring that whatever it is that we are doing from a cybersecurity
perspective is actually in the interest of the organization to ensure that
they&rsquo;re operating securely as it relates to risk mitigation.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 21:16
I&rsquo;m going to ask a question guys, and I wanted to see what you guys think
because obviously talking about risk, the problem we tend to have in
cybersecurity industry is that we are usually in a firefighting mode. We
discover risks, we build mitigation practices for how we&rsquo;re going to
address the risk and then we move on and then we discover new risks. But
I think the problem that normally happens in the industry is that we never
go deep enough to understand why specific risks are happening because if
we go deeper and build those communication lines and address potentially
business processes, business practices to prevent those risks from
happening again, we probably deliver better value to the business. So
what&rsquo;s your guys thoughts on that?</p><p>Speaker 2 - 22:07
I would think that my experience is 50% of the risks we see are coming
from bad guys who are creative for the new way to do something bad.
Yeah. 50% of the risks are typically created by the company internally,
based on what you said, because they had a quick way to organically
develop It applications in the past because they wanted to have a customer
satisfaction, they want quick results. And so there were a few shortcuts or
someone is easy going on third parties because that&rsquo;s a way to do cost
down. So let&rsquo;s do quickly but in principle by not having the proper process
or at least the minimum proper process or minimum due diligence, these
add to the risk.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 22:53
But they are risks which are produced by the company itself and I think
highlighting those and say well, these ones we control, the other ones we
have to work around the bad guys new techniques, we&rsquo;re not in the driving
seat, but we certainly can try to protect ourselves. I would say 50, I would
say. I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s just a ballpark.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 23:20
But I think it&rsquo;s a really good point actually because a lot of this as you said
earlier, is about the risk when it happens. But a lot of work can go into
defining risks. And if you take the time and if boards and executive
committees working with cybersecurity professionals take the time to, I
don&rsquo;t know, commission an audit of their digital estates across all of their
hardware, software, legacy systems, data, et cetera, there&rsquo;s a lot of work.
But the more you do in terms of prep, the better the risk conversation is
going to be down the line when something happens. So I think a lot of this
is if you&rsquo;re willing to invest jointly working together security professionals
with ESCOs on actually defining risk, then you&rsquo;ll have a far greater
chance of being able to deal with it when it emerges later on.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 24:07
Yeah, because I&rsquo;m just kind of alluded to the fact that if you look at the
statistics, every year we spend more and more on cybersecurity and we get
more and more breaches. So just take, for example, if you take an
application security program, normally what happens is we add more
tools, we add more people just to try and solve all the vulnerabilities that
we have, but where the actual problem is our coding practices. So if we
actually improved our quality of the code and the quality of the coding
practices, we wouldn&rsquo;t need to throw money at the tools, at vulnerability
discoveries and patching and all of that. So that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m coming from
in that sense.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 24:53
I think also what makes it a bit difficult and it&rsquo;s basically a segregation of
duty things, sometimes in these meetings a Security Responsible Risk
Manager, or CISO, cannot always say exactly what he&rsquo;s thinking. That is
one problem because if he does say that basically shoots the CIO with the
example, you know, it&rsquo;s the same guy he has to work tomorrow with. And
so it&rsquo;s about finding ways to, on the one side speak out and point the
finger, but on the other hand to find, let&rsquo;s say, quote unquote, a diplomatic
way to not solve one problem and make another one tomorrow out of it.
So it&rsquo;s a bit politics, but you have to navigate in some ways. Unfortunately,
in some cases, that psychological border has been already overcome.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 25:53
I think that goes to the fact that I&rsquo;ve been discussing a lot lately as well as
this. There are companies who need to understand the reasons for hiring a
CISO. I&rsquo;ve been discussing a lot of job descriptions where the top line of
the job description of a CISO is I need ISO 27,001, I need SoC two, type
two, I need PCI, DSS, and that&rsquo;s all we need. Or because another
company told us, oh, we should have a CISO, but we haven&rsquo;t thought or
we haven&rsquo;t thought about supporting lines. And that&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s many
discussions about why CISO should not report to the CIO because there
shouldn&rsquo;t be no politics games. You should be able to tell exactly to the
executives what&rsquo;s wrong in the business. And if you need to play politics
games, then it&rsquo;s wrongly set up and it&rsquo;s wrongly supported security
function.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 26:45
I totally agree. But it&rsquo;s a bit company by company dependent. Some things
you change over time. It&rsquo;s not you have a given situation, I think, when
you come in, but it&rsquo;s not ideal. And I agree. That&rsquo;s why, in my experience,
also separating security from it, from the CIO is one important case
because half of the problems come from it. Typically, then, if they&rsquo;re not
reporting to CIO, to whom do they report? Do they report to the CFO or
does he report to a COO or a CTO? Do we have at least an exceptional
seat in the executive meetings or not? One has to also fight for that. So
you have to fight in some sense or evolve in some sense to get the seat at
the table and hopefully be there reasonably. You should be able to
reasonably speak your mind.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 27:43
It will never be 100%, but I think at least be able to get the message in
clear.</p><p>Speaker 4 - 27:51
Yeah, what actually Mario said it&rsquo;s quite interesting. He actually said,
more tools and more practices we&rsquo;re using. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter. And
I&rsquo;ve been in those conversations with executives. Whether they said to me
or to the team that I&rsquo;m working with, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. We&rsquo;re not going to
change this because obviously something will happen. But that&rsquo;s not the
right conversation. I mean, you need to make sure that you&rsquo;re putting
those tools in place. Again, as I mentioned previously, we live in a crazy
world where obviously the bad guys will try to get to the data within a
company. So, yeah, we just need to make sure that those conversations are
proper conversations with the businesses, and the businesses are going for
the right solutions.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 28:40
Unfortunately, you come to the conclusion, and it&rsquo;s not a good one, that an
occasional breach is helpful because it resets many of the bad practices in
some ways. Obviously, nobody wants the bad things to happen, but it
makes this alignment a bit faster. If nothing has ever happened, then
anybody can see anything forever.</p><p>Speaker 4 - 29:10
I think the best sometimes what we can do is just to make sure that
obviously it&rsquo;s a harder job for the bad actors to essentially steal the data.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 29:23
Yeah, it&rsquo;s just about as well. It&rsquo;s a one piece about governance as well. I&rsquo;ve
been talking with various executives as well. Sometimes it&rsquo;s funnily eluded
as Chief Information Scapegoat Officer instead of Chief Information
Security Officer, because if you are highlighting things and especially bad
practices and specific risks in your organization, how do you document
that? How do you get exceptions? How do you get acceptance of the risk?
Because you have to make sure that this is documented because you
obviously done your job. Whether executives accept the risk or whether
they decide to mitigate, that&rsquo;s up to them. But how do you document that
practice and making sure that it&rsquo;s obviously all evidenced? That&rsquo;s another
very important part of the job.</p><p>Speaker 5 - 30:11
I totally agree with what you have actually said there. Well I think one of
the greatest challenge as it relates to based on what I&rsquo;ve actually
experienced so far in all of this in terms of the communication is actually
having to deal with the existing organizational culture and at times having
to find various practices to break this culture to actually make sense,
getting a feedback. Okay, so having that proper governance structure in
place actually mean makes a difference as Marius is actually alluded to
just a while ago.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 30:58
Yeah, I think culture is very important. As know I&rsquo;ve talked to the
executives know you can have a nice poster in the kitchen that says we are
a collaborative company. But if you are incentivizing only say one person
and the best person in the team, you&rsquo;re not going to get collaboration
because only the best one is going to win. So why would I collaborate with
someone else? So it&rsquo;s always a top down approach. So how do you create
a collaborative culture? How do you involve everyone? And I think that&rsquo;s
what we kind of alluded as well. So yes, scare tactics and scare mongering
works once or twice, but third time you&rsquo;re probably no longer invited to
the table. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s been known security to be as a no sort of
department.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 31:45
And actually I said to my team the other day, I said when did the last time
we said no to the business? And nobody could remember. Because you
can&rsquo;t do that because the more you say no, the less you are listened to. So
how do we say yes, but can we do this with these specific security
requirements in place and instead of using a stick, using a carrot because
everyone extension, essentially everyone in your business is an extension of
security team. They will be able to help and highlight specific risks,
specific malpractices, if they are listened to, supported and welcome to
highlight things.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 32:27
Yeah, I think that&rsquo;s absolutely right. I think on the culture also is what we
I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll all advocate, but celebrating successes and celebrating just
good instances where you never want to be in a culture where people feel
like they can&rsquo;t put their hand up in an organization because they might
have identified a potential breach or whatever. It might, you know, just
anything that involves celebrating somebody making the right sort of
decision or judgment or whatever it might be. I think top down and the
inverse has got to be the way forward. So yeah, I agree, culture is the very
beginning of it all.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 33:04
I think also giving certain problems you cannot solve in one day or one
month. It will take one year, two years, three years. So you have to a little
bit announce a color. Here is short term things. Here&rsquo;s medium term
things. So you become predictable in some sense. It&rsquo;s not this will cost
little money, this will cost more money. And so forth. I think that&rsquo;s okay.
It&rsquo;s what everybody would do in a company and we have to do that too.
Certain problems cannot be solved easily. I mean, obviously you have a
burning thing, you solve it. I&rsquo;m not saying that. The second thing is you
have to come to a point where your opinion is trusted because every day
you have another problem. You cannot in a day by day explain in detail.
Detail.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 33:49
So at some point you have to come to the situation where your opinion
and your advice is trusted because time is running. Yeah. And you have to
do things in the ground. You need to be able be in a situation where people
take they can ask a few questions, but in general they would trust your
advice in some ways knowing that you are not unrealistic or unreasonable
in what you ask. I think that is also a point you have to reach so that
things move on because you can solve one problem today and be killed
tomorrow. So you have to make sure that things move on. Showing the
direction over time your opinion is trusted after a while, maybe at the
beginning is a bit harder.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 34:38
Make sure that you solve day by day problems because if you say things
and tomorrow something stupid happens somewhere else. Your
trustworthy is affected in some ways.</p><p>Speaker 4 - 34:56
And also I think it&rsquo;s really important to segregate the issues within the
businesses and just sort of highlight which issues are more urgent and
which ones need to be remediated much faster than the others. And I
think, Maris, you&rsquo;ve mentioned that obviously how do we track those
changes and things like this when we have those conversations with
people? And I think, again, from my experience, we keep the
documentation. So for example, if we create a document for the
businesses, this document may be for another 18 months or 20 months
over almost a two year going forward the roadmap. And then obviously
we mark the urgencies of changing the segmented issues.</p><p>Speaker 4 - 35:49
And then again, if we have a conversation with that executives or with a
company in next two years, something hasn&rsquo;t been done, but again,
something has happened within that segment, then obviously that&rsquo;s the
issue. But at least we&rsquo;ve mentioned that in the past. And I think that&rsquo;s how
the conversation should also be sort of approached as well, just to
segment those issues, making sure which ones are more important than
the other. And again, every company is different. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important
to speak to someone who knows the culture within a company, who know
how the people work within that company. And again, it&rsquo;s important also
that the businesses are not afraid, that the individuals are not afraid to say
that something has happened within a business.</p><p>Speaker 4 - 36:40
Because, Danny, as you said, you&rsquo;ve been working with a couple of
companies that someone was scared to raise their hand and say, okay,
something has happened because they&rsquo;ve been afraid that they may be
punished for whatever happened. But yeah, I think it&rsquo;s important to
segmented those and making sure which ones are more urgent than the
others and just approach it this way.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 37:09
I think sometimes as well talking about risk, I think the one thing that
sometimes is really missing is we get to the fact of addressing risk at very
local sort of level. And sometimes you need to look at macro and context
because normally nowadays geni is obviously a different conversation but
obviously we are getting more tools and more data points where we can
make more accurate decisions about risk, about the context, about
business, what&rsquo;s happening in macroeconomic level. So hopefully with the
time going we can make better decisions moving forward to understand
the context in where the business is operating, what are specific risks to
that business within their own environment, but also with a bigger sort of
economic scale on what&rsquo;s happening.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 38:01
I think one thing I can recommend in general because in my case I was
facing in the past, I was facing the management, the board, but also I was
facing many different business units which had also very a lot of
independence. It&rsquo;s not like only just the top, but also horizontally you can
see I think one thing which always helped is that and it was an investment
decision is to invest in analytics. Yeah, I was able to invest a percentage of
my budget to build analytics again, I could show numbers to everybody,
numbers per month, numbers evolution, numbers per business unit, who is
doing better, you can say okay, this one is doing very bad, this one is doing
well. It&rsquo;s very powerful to compare in the same company, two different
behaviors but the numbers don&rsquo;t come easily.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 38:52
You have to have building analytics system. It takes one year, two years,
three year. You have to have a bit of an idea where you go because the
data is all over the place. You have to measure it, you have to build it, you
have to put metal layers above it so that you can represent data. But it is
one of the guaranteed, I would say 100% or 99% sure way to get the
return of investment in terms of moving away from judgments only and
substantiating things. And the numbers are very powerful, especially when
you compare behaviors between divisions because someone says well,
what you ask is unreasonable, but then you show the numbers well, this
one did it already and you are not doing it inside the company.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 39:33
Comparisons is very powerful versus just saying well, something is wrong
if you can show someone has already solved the problem and here&rsquo;s the
numbers and someone has not and here&rsquo;s the numbers. This takes away a
lot of the problematic things especially when you have many business units
horizontally.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 39:52
Yeah, and I think that feeds into risk monitoring because sometimes I
witnessed facts where we have a specific, say, risk, we developed a
mitigation plan for that risk. We mitigated risk to an acceptable level. Yes,
we did that at this point in time. But sometimes organizations or some
specific risk professionals tend to, when you mitigate the risk on
acceptable level, that risk is closed. But if you don&rsquo;t have an adequate
monitoring, because this is a point in time exercise, how do you know
what&rsquo;s the risk output or the risk measurement within next 3612 months,
18 months, that risk might completely change, and that mitigation might
not be adequate anymore in a time frame. So the monitoring of the risk
and constant evaluation is very important.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 40:42
Some regulations ask you to do a risk assessment every twelve months,
but you have to gauge in your risk appetite where specific risks might need
to be measured and assessed more often than every twelve months.</p><p>Speaker 4 - 40:55
Yeah, 100% agree with this, because again, the plan for the businesses at
this point may not be the same within next twelve months. So constant
conversation with the businesses, with executives, this is quite important
as well. So you need as a business to schedule those conversations every
sort of six to twelve months. Because again, what you said, and I
completely agree with this, the plan of action for today may not be
adequate within next twelve months, because again, the organization
grow, the cybersecurity may change, the threats may change, the system
obviously is going to be outdated within that time. There are many factors
that has an impact on that. So scheduling those conversations within the
right people, within a business, it&rsquo;s 100% crucial.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 41:53
I had two examples. I had one case where someone, one managing
director took one new risk every year as a focus for you, and he wanted
reporting, how is everybody doing on that risk? And we of course have to
still take care of the previous year things. But it was instead of going all
directions, his way of thinking was, well, we have to take an objective
every year, one single or two objectives, and we solve that one and we add
it to what we solved the years before. And this way, instead of having to
talk 25 different things or 25 different risks, there was a focus on getting a
deeper understanding per risk for one year, and then this was hopefully
understood and we could move on to the next risk the next year.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 42:41
That was one way, which made it very clear, and he wanted details per
business unit, per department, how were doing on that risk. It was one
way to move forward. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s the only way. Sometimes you
have no choice. But if you have the choice, having focus points for
management, say, this year we focus on this, next year we focus on that.
Of course, you choose the important ones in some ways where you and we
would get management support to solve that risk more than any other
year or any other way. That&rsquo;s one management technique if you want to
move on.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 43:18
I think I actually quite like that. I like it&rsquo;s novel. It&rsquo;s interesting. Different
way of looking at it. I do think though, that it&rsquo;s important that the cyber
risks are very much part and parcel of the overall red amber green risk
management framework that any exco or board has, because the
likelihood is that the cyber risks are going to be right up there. And I think
then executives suddenly realize that out of six top risks, two or three are
cyber related. And it really elevates the importance of the conversation as
a result when you&rsquo;re able to compare the risk within the rest of the risks
that the organization faces and not see it as a separate one. So I think
bringing it, as I say, as part of the overall risk management framework is
really important.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 44:10
Yeah, because I think security, as we kind of all know, security can&rsquo;t
happen in a silo. And I think sometimes, as we discussed previously, it&rsquo;s
often seen as It issue. But when you start expanding security into any
department, there is specific security system security risks that everyone
faces, whether it&rsquo;s HR, whether it&rsquo;s business development. And I think we
as security professionals has a way to expand and go beyond it. And I&rsquo;ve
always been a proponent, for example, how do we deliver value? Because
I&rsquo;ve been discussing as well in my previous post, normally how do created
narratives where security is not a cost center, security is a business
enabler.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 44:58
So how can we I created Slides as well for my business development guys
about how do we do security well for our proposal customers, that it&rsquo;s safe
for their customers to hold data with us, how do we deliver business value
for our potential clients? So expanding that security sort of vision across
various departments can really transcend how you deliver value as well as
address risks.</p><p>Speaker 3 - 45:27
I think that is such a good point, Marius. I mean, the enabling that you
just talked about, because I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve all seen a whole bunch of
presentations where executive teams say, okay, item one, digital strategy.
Item two, cybersecurity strategy. And you&rsquo;re like, no, cybersecurity is the
enabling part of your digital strategy. Don&rsquo;t separate it. And I think that
sort of positive good. Cybersecurity means growth, means greater
revenue, means greater opportunity, et cetera. That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about.
As opposed to, let&rsquo;s have a separate session to talk about how we protect
stuff. So I completely agree with you, and.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 46:04
I think that&rsquo;s why I lately been focusing because we keep talking about
security. But if we can transcend security into talking about as quality
function, whether it&rsquo;s code, whether it&rsquo;s our It infrastructure, whether it&rsquo;s
protecting our brand reputation, the more we build quality with security in
mind, the better we deliver business value.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 46:26
I think you can position security under the logo enable business in an
unsecure world. If you take that as your headline, it makes the discussion
a little bit easier. But it is true that depending on the business and the
business challenges, someone may be willing to take a hit somewhere if
that makes the business move faster. A security incident doesn&rsquo;t cost
necessarily 100 million, but it could. But maybe an incident cost us 40,000
or 50,000. Someone say well, okay, losing money is never good, but it&rsquo;s
something we can accept because if we would find a way around it would
make things more inefficient, we may lose more. So having a good
discussion like that gives us a feeling, okay, what the priorities are. I had
also cases where certain top executives had go and no go things.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 47:28
They were very sensitive to certain topics and zero tolerance for certain
things and they would be very much willing to have money discussion on
others. So I think that is also important that it&rsquo;s finding out, because it
gives you also priorities. Even for CISO, it avoids that you go run in all
directions. But the other one is when you look at for example, CRM
systems. I had cases like when we investigated, we found out that there&rsquo;s
let&rsquo;s say a million records in a CRM system. Yeah, only 20% get emailing.
The other ones are just registered. Registered. Nobody does everything. So
we said please, if you do not do anything with the 80%, please take some
offline. We only should protect things which have economic value, which is
obviously only the 20%. That is a change as totally as a direct discussion.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 48:25
Of course they are a bit shocked why we collect so much and we use a
little okay, that discussion has to be done, but at least there is a logic to it
and I.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 48:36
Think sometimes some other things as well. What we alluded in the
beginning is you need to understand the business because the risk
mitigation the risk framework, the risk appetite will changes depends on
your organization. So if you walk into a bank, they&rsquo;re obviously going to
be very risk aware and they&rsquo;re obviously going to risk a lot less. Where if
you walk into a startup and you&rsquo;re trying to grab as much of their market
share as possible because you just created the new product, you&rsquo;re going
to create more risks and you&rsquo;re going to do more risk because you want to
grow fast and you want to grab as much of the market. When you reach a
certain maturity level, your risk appetite will change. So you need to be
aware of business context and where you are in that maturity sort of scale.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 49:19
I think in some cases when you study your risk equation, you have to solve
it, whatever it is. Maybe when the organization is bigger, but sometimes
when the organization is smaller SMEs or others smaller, you have to first
simplify the risk equation before you solve it. Otherwise they cannot afford
it, they cannot sustain it. In some sense, if you have 25 images on your
endpoints and you have to do vulnerability management and patching,
you&rsquo;re going to kill yourself possibly unless you&rsquo;re helped in some way. So
sometimes you have to find a way to simplify the equation first and then
solve it and not apply big money to solve the wrong problem. I think that
also gives the executive feeling that you are thinking about common sense
and practical, economical ways to solve things.</p><p>Speaker 5 - 50:16
Sure. And just to add to that important point is one of the things I
normally do is always to identify, going back to the basics, how does this
organization, how does this business actually generates revenue? What are
my business assets? Not everything within the organization generates
revenue or contributes to that overall revenue generation. So I always
have my business assets. What are the risks to those business assets? What
are the cyber risks to the business? What are the likelihood that risk can
actually affect the business? What&rsquo;s the associated cost if that risk actually
affects the business and what&rsquo;s the cost to fix it? So I always operate
within that line in terms of simplifying my risk communication. Always
keep it as simple as best as possible for the executives to actually
understand.</p><p>Speaker 5 - 51:15
So whatever it is, always align, return on investment, always go back to
revenue generation.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 51:26
In another way. I have seen some people who have been thinking, okay, I
need to reflex. I have $100,000 or euro in my pocket and I will solve this
problem by using 100,000 or 10,000. And because you&rsquo;re given a budget,
you have to stay within it and you have to solve it. And there is sometimes
the wrong reflex also that instead of going to the right people and says, I
need a million to solve this problem because this is a very big problem, this
sometimes is not done. So we&rsquo;re kind of educated or trained or
conditioned and it&rsquo;s also not only me and the CISO, but even the layers
below may sing in this way or they say, okay, I have to manage within that
level.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 52:18
So sometimes the risks don&rsquo;t come up properly also this way because some
says, well, I know it&rsquo;s a risk, but okay, I&rsquo;m going to use my $10,000 to
solve it as much as I can rather than bringing it up and have the CISO ask
a million dollar to fix it or something like that. I think there&rsquo;s another big
problem I see in this risk communication.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 52:47
I think we go a couple of minutes left. So any final thoughts from you
guys?</p><p>Speaker 3 - 52:57
I think communication, culture and enablement are some of the words
that really stick out for me over the last hour.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 53:10
Anyone else? Pate, final words.</p><p>Speaker 4 - 53:15
I agree with Danny says now those three key points and obviously
speaking to the right people in the organization, that&rsquo;s the key point as
well, the ones that understand the culture, how the organization works,
and just to sort of those risks.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 53:37
I was living in a Japanese company, and in a Japanese company, just
difference, maybe of an American company, you would not go to a meeting
to have a debate. The discussions happen individually before the meeting.
Yeah, because it&rsquo;s not possible to have agreement on with 1012 people,
possibly. But it&rsquo;s possible to discuss in depth, frankly, with individual
members beforehand and to try to move to reasonable consensus when the
formal meeting is happening. Which is more formal or ceremony in some
sense. That&rsquo;s a Japanese way of doing it. It&rsquo;s not you don&rsquo;t expose anybody
publicly, you don&rsquo;t attack someone publicly.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 54:26
But you spend a lot of time in the preparation of the meeting with
different individuals to get their point of view, to explain your point of
view, which you can do typically in a much more frank way beforehand, so
that you can crystallize a proposal where you get a majority support at the
end. But that&rsquo;s the culture of a Japanese company versus maybe others.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 54:51
Yeah, and I would say it&rsquo;s very important as well. We discussed get to the
bottom of the problem, so I don&rsquo;t remember which book it was, but it said,
ask five why questions to get to the bottom and the root cause of why
things are happening. Because we need to move away from firefighting
into being proactive, risk addressing function that can deliver business
value. And what we just discussed being a business enabler. So I think
that&rsquo;s very important.</p><p>Speaker 5 - 55:28
But I would say one of the very important points coming from this is
actually spending that time to understand what is that the executives
actually think, as Marius rightly mentioned, what actually keeps them up,
what is that they&rsquo;re thinking about what&rsquo;s of importance to them as it
relates to an organization overall productivity. So, yeah, those are the key
points that I think I have actually gained from skin.</p><p>Speaker 1 - 56:04
Brilliant. I think that&rsquo;s pretty much it. Thank you, guys.</p><p>Speaker 2 - 56:07
Thank you so much.</p><hr><div class="edit-link hidden-print"><ul class=github><li><a href=https://github.com/OpenSecuritySummit/oss2021/edit/main/content/sessions/2023/mini-summits/Oct/Governance/Risk-Communication-Bridgin-the-Gap-between-Risk-Professionals-and-Executives.md target=_blank><i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o"></i>Edit this page</a>
