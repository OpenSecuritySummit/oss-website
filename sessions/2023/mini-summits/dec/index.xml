Panelists will discuss how organizations can identify and attract candidates for roles such as cloud security specialists, threat hunters, incident responders, and privacy experts.
Outline: -Overview of emerging roles and job titles in cybersecurity
Identifying the necessary skills and qualifications for new roles Adapting job descriptions and recruitment approaches to attract specialized candidates Strategies for assessing candidates&amp;rsquo; proficiency in emerging cybersecurity domains Case studies showcasing successful recruitment strategies for emerging roles</description></item><item><title>GitLab Security Tools (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/panel-gitlab-security-tools/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/panel-gitlab-security-tools/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Open Security Summit Awards and plans for 2023</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/dec/oss/open-security-summit-awards-and-2023-plans/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/dec/oss/open-security-summit-awards-and-2023-plans/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Risk Acceptance and OISRU (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/risk-acceptance-and-oisru/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/risk-acceptance-and-oisru/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>SemGrep in the CI/CD Pipeline: Automating Code Quality and Security Checks (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/dec/semgrep/semgrep-in-the-ci-cd-pipeline-automating-code-quality-and-security-checks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/dec/semgrep/semgrep-in-the-ci-cd-pipeline-automating-code-quality-and-security-checks/</guid><description>About this session This topic focuses on integrating SemGrep into the CI/CD pipeline for automated code quality and security checks. Panelists will discuss the practical implementation of SemGrep in various stages of the pipeline, its impact on reducing vulnerabilities and improving overall code quality, and strategies for handling false positives.
Outline: Importance of integrating static analysis into the CI/CD pipeline Configuring SemGrep for automated code scanning in different pipeline stages Strategies for managing false positives and reducing noise Collaborating with development and security teams for effective implementation Real-world examples and best practices of SemGrep integration in CI/CD workflows</description></item><item><title>Social Engineering Attacks: Strengthening Human Firewall(Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/dec/secure-by-scenario/social-engineering-attacks-strengthening-human-firewall/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/dec/secure-by-scenario/social-engineering-attacks-strengthening-human-firewall/</guid><description>About this session Scenario: Examine the tactics used in social engineering attacks and discuss strategies to strengthen the human firewall within organizations. Explore phishing awareness, employee training, and incident response plans.
Outline: Understanding social engineering attacks: Types of attacks, techniques, and real-world examples. Phishing awareness: Educating employees about identifying and reporting phishing attempts. Employee training: Providing simulated social engineering exercises and ongoing security awareness training. Incident response: Developing incident response plans specifically tailored to social engineering attacks.</description></item><item><title>Using Splunk for Incident Response (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/panel-using-splunk-for-incident-response/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/panel-using-splunk-for-incident-response/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Zero Trust Architecture: Strengthening Cloud Security Posture (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/zero-trust-architecture-strengthening-cloud-security-posture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/zero-trust-architecture-strengthening-cloud-security-posture/</guid><description>About this session This topic focuses on the implementation of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) in cloud environments. It examines the principles and best practices of ZTA, including micro-segmentation, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and continuous monitoring, to enhance security in a cloud-centric ecosystem.
Outline: Introduction to Zero Trust Architecture and its Significance in cloud security Micro-segmentation and network-based access controls Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and continuous identity verification Leveraging automation for policy enforcement and anomaly detection Case studies highlighting successful implementations of Zero Trust Architecture in the cloud</description></item></channel></rss>
