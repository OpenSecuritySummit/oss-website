## About this session
PLOT4ai stands for Privacy Library of Threats for Artificial Intelligence. This threat modeling library inspired on LINDDUN GO has been created to help you build responsible AI systems.  It contains currently a collection of 86 threats classified in 8 different categories. 
But PLOT4ai is more than a collection of threats: it also provides a card game and a methodology to make it easy and accessible to everyone working in the field of ML/AI to do threat modeling. And the best of all? It is open source,  available in GitHub and hopefully it becomes one day a community-driven project.
