Hi. Welcome to the last session in Open City Summit. April 2023. We&rsquo;re
going to end with a bang on actually a super massively important topic,
which we&rsquo;ve done a whole bunch of sessions before. I&rsquo;m very glad that
Kieran and Subi are going to continue their thinking and give us some
really great case studies on really woman kickoff inside security, which I&rsquo;m
a big defender and I really believe we need to get a lot more talent and a
lot more women in cybersecurity. So over to you.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Yeah. Thank you, Denis. Today we are going to talk about women kick off
in cybersecurity. Yes, before proceeding with the session, we would like to
give a quick introduction of ourselves. So, I&rsquo;m Surbhi Gupta and I am a
cybersecurity analyst with more than three years of experience in this
technology. I have worked on technologies like SIM, security information
and event management. I have worked on vulnerability assessment and
endpoint protection. My skill set includes Splunk, Nessus, semantic. I&rsquo;m
also a Zero certified Cloud engineer. I am currently a cybersecurity
learner at Cybersecurity Academy program in OSI, Norway. Now I will
hand over to Kieran to introduce herself.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
Yeah, I am Kieran. I have done Masters in Technology back india and I
have five years experience in teaching. Now presently I am going on
training period in Telenor and where I am working with cloud
technologies. After that, during this period, I have done some
certifications, like cloud certifications. Now I am a cybersecurity learner
at the Innoscience Academy. I will start now to the session. Main aim of
the today session is what is the cybersecurity challenges faced by women
in cybersecurity, domains in cybersecurity, career roles and pathway in
cybersecurity. So let&rsquo;s discuss first what is cybersecurity? Actually, we have
made this presentation in simplest form. Who are new to cybersecurity, it
is easy for them to understand what is it basically?</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
Cybersecurity is basically the protecting for protecting computer system
networks and digital information from unauthorized access, theft and
damage. In other words, you can say that cybersecurity is all about
ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of digital
information by mitigating the risk and threats posed by cybercriminals.
So, who are new for them? What is confidentiality? So, CIA trade is the
model that organization used to evaluate the security capabilities and risk.
So CIA is confidentiality, integrity and availability. So first discuss the
confidentiality. Confidentiality is the protecting information to make sure
only those people who are allowed to use the information are allowed to
use it. By enabling the access Control policy, encrypt data, use multibit
authentication, we can maintain the confidentiality. Next is integrity.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
Integrity means that data or information in your system is maintained so
that it is not modified deleted by unauthorized parties. For example, if
your company provides information about Senior Manager on your
website, and some information need to have integrity if it is inaccurate,
then those who visiting the website for information may feel your
organization is not trustworthy. So how can we protect the integrity? By
using hashing, encryption and digital certificates we can maintain the
integrity. And third one is availability. The final component of CIA trade is
availability. It means that the system and the data available to individuals
when they need it under any circumstances including power outages and
natural disasters. Without availability, if you have met the other two
components of CIA trade, your business can never be negatively impacted
can be negatively impacted to ensure the availability, your organization
can use redundant network servers and application.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
We can say that an information security system that is lacking in one of
these three aspects of CIA trade is insufficient. Next is women&rsquo;s in
cybersecurity according to various studies and reports in the modern
world also women continue to underrepresented in the field of
cybersecurity. Women in cybersecurity earn less than man. According to
reports in the United States, the gender pay gap is cybersecurity 18% so it
is higher than the average pay gap across all the industries. According to
Cybersecurity Ventures magazines, women make up only 24% of the
cybersecurity workflow globally. According to Cybercrime Magazine
survey prediction, women will represent 30% of the global cybersecurity
workflow by 2025 and that will reach 35% by 2031. These statics highlight
the need for the industry to prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion efforts
in order to address the underrepresentation of women in cybersecurity and
create a more welcoming and inclusive environment for all the
professionals.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
Next is challenges there are many challenges that women face sorry, some
of them are lack of representation. Women are underrepresented in the
leadership position in cybersecurity which can make it difficult for them to
find role models and mentors. Next isolation women in cybersecurity may
feel isolated particularly if they are only women on a team or in the
department so that may make it difficult for build relationship with the
colleagues. Third is hostile work environment women may experience
hostile work environment in which they are subjected to harassment,
bullying and even threats. This can lead to high level of stress and anxiety
that may ultimately drive a moment out of the field. And next is gender
bias. The woman in the cybersecurity open face gender bias which can
manifest in many forms including unequal pay, lack of promotion,
opportunity and discrimination in hiring. Next is stereotype. The woman in
cybersecurity may be subjected to negative stereotypes such as being seen
as less technical or competent than their male counterparts.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
This can lead to a lack of recognition for their skills and contributions.
Next is work life balance you can say that women in cybersecurity may
face challenges in achieving work life balance, particularly if they have a
caregiving responsibilities. This can make it difficult to take on demanding
roles and pursue advanced training and education. It is important for the
industry to address these challenges and create a more inclusive and
welcoming environment for the women in the cybersecurity. This can
include initiative to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, as well as
providing mentorship, training and networking opportunities for the
woman in the field. Next, is why women choose cybersecurity. As the static
say that there are very less moments in cybersecurity if we compared to
men. There are many reasons that should motivate a woman to choose
this cybersecurity path. So in which first is growing demand. The demand
for cybersecurity professionals increasing rapidly.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
With the rise of cyber attacks and cyber threats and the increasing
importance of protecting digital assets, this means that there are plenty of
job opportunities in the field. Next is job security. Security is a rapidly
growing industry and there is a high demand for skilled professionals. This
means that job in the field tend to be relatively secure and stable. Third is
good pay. Cybersecurity professionals tend to earn competitive salaries
and pay can be quite well paid. According to report, average cybersecurity
salary in the US is around dollar 90,000 to dollar 103,000 per year. This is
more than the double the national median earning of workers across all
the industries. Next is intellectual change. Cybersecurity is complex and
constantly involving fields, which means that it can be intellectually
challenging and stimulating. There is always something new to learn and
the work can be highly rewarded. Next is opportunity for the impact.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
Cybersecurity professionals play a crucial role in the protecting
organization, government and individual from cyber threat. This means
that the work is meaningful and has a real impact on the world. Next is
opportunities for the growth. Cybersecurity is a field that is constantly
evolving, which means that there are plenty of opportunities for growth
and advancement. This can include taking on leadership role, pursuing
advanced training or education, and branching out into the late fields.
Next is diversity of roles. Cybersecurity is a field that encompasses on a
wide range of roles and responsibility, from technical positions such as
penetration tester and security analysts, to nontechnical roles such as
policy analysts and compliance specialists. This means that there is
something for everyone, regardless of their background or skill set. Now,
Surbhi will take you further. Over to you.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Be thank you, Kiran. Now as we know that to protect cybersecurity, we
need to know about the confidentiality, integrity and availability trend. I
started learning cybersecurity, what I had in mind was like a figure, a
person who is sitting in a dark room and as you used writing some codes
and trying to intrude the organization network. I thought that a job of a
cybersecurity professional was to stop that person from intruding a
particular network. Okay, then I thought, okay, I should be an ethical
hacker, I should start learning coding and I should start learning how to
exploit vulnerabilities in an organization and how I can fix them so I
thought that this is one of the most important role for one person can take
in cybersecurity. There are many roles like from protecting an
organization from a cyber attack to the procedure what happens after a
cyber attack has taken place?</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
I would be covering some of the domains which are in cybersecurity. First
is the network security. The network security basically deals with the
implementation of procedures and technologies which are used to protect
your network against intrusion, unauthorized excess or modification or
destruction of your network resources and also protection of your data
which is being transmitted from one network to a different other network.
What are the implementations that we can do? Like using a firewall which
can filter the incoming and outgoing traffic using intrusion detection
system or intrusion prevention system which can identify and block
malicious traffic. We can use virtual private network so we can also use
network segmentation to segment the networks so that if an attack takes
place in one network, it does not spread to the other networks. This is
basically what is done in network security. Incident Response in foreign
six, the name itself is that when there is a security incident for suppose
there is a data breach or there is a malware incident, how should we
respond to that security incident?</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
This is what is covered incident response. And forensics? Forensics is
basically once the data attack has been the attack has been happened,
what evidences do we have? How do we collect those evidences? How do
we preserve those evidences? What analysis can we do on those evidences?
How can we gather our analysis in a particular report and present it to the
organization? What security recommendations can we implement so that
this attack doesn&rsquo;t happen in the future? Or we can protect our
organization at the maximum limit? The third domain I would like to talk
about is governance, risk and compliance which basically deals with the
management and the rules and procedures which an organization follows
in decision making or in daily operations. At the same time being
compliant with industry and industry standards, rules and regulations like
ISO and PCI DSS for example, cloud Security what is cloud security?</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Mostly in earlier time the infrastructure was always on premise. Now the
infrastructure is either shared or is entirely on cloud. Our resources, our
application, our user accounts, everything is on cloud. So how can we
protect them? All about cloud security, for example, like implementing
multifactor authentication maybe. How can we protect our resources in
cloud deals with cloud security like us, pass us the cloud services.
Everything is covered in cloud security. Identity and access Management
as the name itself says that we are managing the identities from the
identification to management to the deletion of identity, the user roles, the
groups, the devices, everything. That is identity and access management,
authorization, authentication, auditing, reporting everything is covered in
identity and access management. Application Security application Security
is basically protecting our application from the security threats and
vulnerabilities by running scans on our application, identifying the
vulnerabilities and fixing them, also protecting them against attacks like
cross site scripting, SQL Injection so these are some of the domains which
I wanted to talk about in cybersecurity.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Now we can discuss about the roles in cybersecurity. Career Roles in
Cybersecurity so now we have a fair idea about what actually happens in
cybersecurity. What are the different domains so we can talk about
compliance Auditor these are some of the career roles because there are
various career roles in cybersecurity. I would like to cover some like
compliance. Auditor what does a compliance auditor do? Anyone who
loves to follow rules and who wants that the organization should be
compliant with all the rules and regulations should opt for this role, which
is compliance Auditor. The function of Compliance Auditor is to run
audits, to check if the resources are non compliant, which field is non
compliant, and to provide recommendation. Security Analyst so I started
my journey as a Sock analyst and my function was to analyze the logs and
gather information, data analysis and mitigate the risk to any extent.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Okay, so that would be security Analyst penetration Tester works like you
can connect ethical Hacker and Penetration Tester. It exploits
vulnerabilities which are in organization networks and resources and then
reports those vulnerabilities to the organization and suggest the
recommendation. That how we can fix them. Incident Responder as the
name says it responds to the security Incident. Basically, they define a
strategy that if a security incident takes place in the organization, how
can we respond it and what will be the roles and responsibility of the
team? Security Concern security Concern basically, if you have expertise
enough to guide your team in case of a security incident and to give
security awareness trainings to everyone in the organization, you should
go for Security Consultant. Security Architect now, this role requires a
large amount of expertise in network architecture, system design, and this
is a person who basically knows how to design and implement security
solutions in the organization.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Now we have a fair idea about the career roles in cybersecurity along with
ethical hacker. Let&rsquo;s move to the next pathway. So, as I said in the
beginning, we will be sharing a very simple pathway for a person who is
beginner in the cybersecurity. Now, the very first thing what you should do
is to learn the It fundamentals. You should know what you are protecting.
What is a computer, what is a hardware, what is networking, what is an IP
address? Then what is like yes, basic knowledge. What is the OS? Right?
What kind of languages are being used in a web application, how does an
application work? That is all covered in It fundamentals and there are
various platforms which provide training on these It fundamentals like
Google itself provides a certification program then we have Code
Academy, we have Coursera, we have W three schools which is entirely for
learning different code languages.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
After you have learned the it fundamentals, even the basic you can
proceed to basics of cybersecurity. Meaning? You should know what is
cybersecurity? What is a ransomware? What is a malware? What is a
Trojan? What is cryptography? What is encryption? What is
authentication? What is authorization? Basics of cybersecurity so that you
can implement them in the future. There are various platforms where you
learn them some of being the common like Coursera. Now I also know
about Tech Target which writes about these topics in a very simple
manner. You can also refer to YouTube, you can refer to LinkedIn where
these trainings are provided. The third step according to me should be
gain practical experience. Why I haven&rsquo;t mentioned certification before?
Practical experience because it is very important to have en hands on
experience to understand what you studied well should connect to you the
terms in mind like we can achieve that through Capture the Flag.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
If you guys have heard about the capture, the flag is basically a
cybersecurity competition where the individuals compete in team, are
single handed, and there are certain vulnerabilities which the organizers
plan, and we need to exploit them in order to gain a flag. That flag is in
the form of code. When we submit that code to the organization, then we
get some points and we win. It is basically like a gaming experience. There
is also a platform like Try Hack me I have used it and personally I would
say it is very good because it covers all the knowledge from Basic to
Advanced. They have virtual machines where you can practice they also
have certain rooms where they mention information about certain skills
and then they test you on that so you gain practical experience on it and
then there&rsquo;s also Hack the Box. After having certain practical experience
you can also go for internships and you can also try going for this
internships with various organizations.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Semantic offers such internship and there are many more IBM offers also
the internship. After having a certain amount of practical experience you
can decide your cyber security career to which role suits you the most and
maybe after gaining some practical experience you can go for certain
certifications like Comfy Security plus and then you would have a fair idea
which domain of cybersecurity interests you more. You can choose a
cybersecurity according to your interest. This was a simple pathway from
our side. In the next slide we would like to share some resources like some
online learning assets like I mentioned earlier, code Academy, Coursera, W
three schools I think YouTube is the best source but there is I would say a
little demerit with YouTube because it is a vast platform. It is a platform
with a large number of videos and you might get confused for which video
you should follow, which video should not.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
I think you should be specific in what you want to learn. Then, as I
mentioned, Tech Target because as a beginner in cybersecurity I usually
used to read the articles from Tech Target to understand what technology
is, what does it mean, what resource it is. I would highly recommend
Techtarget.com then LinkedIn. We have so many free learnings in
LinkedIn related to any field. So you should try LinkedIn also. My
suggestion is, like, you should subscribe to Cybersecurity News. Like the
Hacker News Security Week. Cyberscope? It is very important to remain
updated in cybersecurity about maybe the vulnerabilities which are being
discovered or maybe the attacks, or maybe the new security technologies
which are coming in place. Yeah, I would recommend these learning
assets. Let&rsquo;s move to the next slide. Quick Tips as we discussed earlier,
learn fundamentals. You should be very clear with your fundamentals.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
You should get certified. Now, whenever I sit for looking for a job, I
usually see there are so many job postings which require certain
certifications. Most common I see is like CISSP. CISSP requires five years
of cybersecurity experience before going for it. I think for a beginner level
you should start with Conscious Security Plus. And then you should
advance further. If you want to go for Ethical Hacking, you should go for
Certified Ethical Hacker or Junior Pen Tester. First you should know what
field you want to go in. Then again, gain practical experience. Stay up to
date. You should stay up to date. I mean, you should know what
technology is recent, then develop soft skills. Having technical knowledge
is important, but if you are not able to convey it, then it&rsquo;s not so useful
because you are working in cybersecurity but your vendors, your
organization, it is not necessary that everyone is aware of the technical
jargons you might be using.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
You should know how to convey your message in simple language. And
also I would also say networking. Grow your network as much as you can.
Communicate with people. Join cybersecurity groups online, on LinkedIn,
on various other platforms, on Facebook so that you can connect with
other people, you can learn from them. So, these were some quick tips
from my side and now I would like to talk about Inocai. Me and Karen are
from Innoci School of Programming. Innoci offers learning courses and
works with a motive of reducing the technical skill gap and inclusion
diversity. Since the course at Inocai are intense, they also offer mentor
sessions, mental mentor sessions and weekly mentor sessions. Like they
are very effective because mentors from different organization come and
guide us through their career journey and we are able to learn so much
from them. At Innocera we go through effective learning programs.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
There are also programs, real time real world programs which are set by
industry experts. Now they make us ready with the skills so that we are up
to date when we join a certain job. So I would like to thank NSI for this
opportunity. My journey at NSI. If I talk about it I came to know about
NSI from LinkedIn and personally if I speak I have worked on premises
and I wanted to learn cloud technology and also I was so enthusiastic to
know how cybersecurity is helping and protecting resources on cloud. I
looked up at NSI and there I got a program which had both the things
where I could learn both the things the cloud computing as well as how
cybersecurity is helping secure the resources in cloud computing. It was a
boom for me and I had to go for it and frankly speaking this was a very
good experience.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
This is actually a very good experience for me because the course is
intense but the course is designed in such a way that you learn very
efficiently. You are at pace and mentor sessions that I spoke about earlier.
We get a lot of guidance. My networking has also improved after joining
inocyte so I would highly recommend you guys also if you are thinking of
being a career in It, go for it. And Kiran, would you like to share your
experience with Innocence?</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
Yes, thank you. Actually I also want to share my experience how I started
my journey with Enoscience. As I have discussed in the starting of the
presentation I have five years of teaching experience so I do not have any
It experience. Last year I have started internship at Telenoras Cloud
Engineer where I have learned a lot about cloud technology. During this
time I have attended many seminars where I came to know about
cybersecurity. I am a person who always try my hands in learning new
things and I challenge myself to learn more about cybersecurity.
Inoscience came to my life and which was entirely a game changer for me.
Which combined my both cloud experience and my cybersecurity
learnings. Today I am with a quite a good exposure in cybersecurity. This
is my experience how I have started my journey with Inoscience. If you
want to tie your hands with learning something new and wants to make a
career in cybersecurity then come and join us at Inoscience and be a part
of cybersecurity society.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
For any question regarding innoscience please contact and follow and
given information. You can also follow Serbia and me on the LinkedIn. If
you have any further curious regarding how to start career and in
cybersecurity we are happy to help you. Thank you. We are also open to
any questions.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Yeah I have a couple really cool. I really like the way you&rsquo;re explaining the
different paths and the different ways to get into cybersecurity, which is
really cool. Do you have any thoughts about people with quite a lot of
experience? I think we talked before we started. I think a big source of
talent, of course, is the new generation, right? It&rsquo;s making them excited
about it, saying it&rsquo;s a great career, right. I would say for anybody that&rsquo;s
new joining, you should still reassure that you have individuals on the
older side. I would put myself on that side now that we&rsquo;ve been doing this
for 30 years, but we&rsquo;re still super passionate. We love it and it&rsquo;s a great
career, right? And there&rsquo;s some amazing problems to solve. I think that
path is in, but I feel that in the kind of diversity side of things, I feel that
we&rsquo;re missing a little trick by not finding good ways to bring talent that is
quite experienced and for example, is really great at engineering, really
great at medicine, really great at other very complex careers.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Somebody with a PhD really knows how to process data, right? Somebody
that works on any or works for managing a lot of people in certain
situations. They know a lot about the core, almost. They have a lot of the
core skills that we need in cybersecurity, but they might not have
cybersecurity experience. What&rsquo;s your thoughts on how do we can help
them to come into kind of our world where although they don&rsquo;t have a
couple of little things that they need to learn, almost the hard capabilities
that we all want to hire for, they already have?</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
So Karen, should I answer this? Okay, so as Denis, you said that there are
people who have skills and they are highly qualified in them, but they do
not know cybersecurity so much. I personally think that we should give
everyone a chance if you think that they have that potential, that they will
be able to combat any type of attack with the skills that they have learned
from their past profession. What we can do from myself, if I say from the
outsider, we can specify certain basic skills, just as I said, for a beginner to
have certain basic certifications. Right? Because I think that if they are so
much qualified in the profession that they are doing, I think experience is
more important than skills. If they are able to learn a skill which is quite
good in their profession, I personally believe that they will be able to pop
up quickly in this profession.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
The only thing required is the support from our side. And the clarity. The
clarity that what exactly do we expect from us? Do we require a certain
basic level of expectation certification, right, or do we require we are
actually judging them on the basis of their knowledge, like providing
trainings. I think for me, the solution would be like to provide them
trainings and then for a certain period of time and then invite them for an
interview like we do with our employees in the organization. I personally
feel like this because giving them not a chance. I don&rsquo;t think this is going
to solve the problem just because we have the fear that they won&rsquo;t be able
to whether they will be able to do it or not.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
When you say we provide them trainings but there&rsquo;s lots of training online
already, right? There&rsquo;s lots of really good open source training stuff. If you
want to learn how to hack, there&rsquo;s online platforms even for free, right.
You can set up juice shop, you can fire up a bunch of things, right, so you
mean those to see almost like hey, if you can find, try that and if you really
like it, then we just want to see the delta where they were and now and see
their excitement about it.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Yes. Because if they are passionate about entering them, suppose if there
is a job for an ethical hacker in your organization and you are searching
for someone who has at least a hand on experience on CTF, I think you
should interview that guy. Right. To have that knowledge. Or you can
provide them with a specification just like before interviewing. You can
come up with these courses, just prepare these courses and then you are
eligible to sit for an interview so they will have a clean perspective.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Yeah, which is interesting. We kind of talk about it. It&rsquo;s almost you&rsquo;re
saying we can even create a curriculum for non security experts and
saying look, here&rsquo;s the kind of path if you think about that curriculum
should be the same one that they follow internally, right. We should say,
look, if you&rsquo;re going into the cybersecurity, this is the path we would like
you or recommend you to take.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Right?</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Here are the actions and hear the things, right?</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Yes.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Actually to be like maybe we should do an open security summit project
around it because I need it. I think there isn&rsquo;t a good path out there.
Ideally in this session you could actually turn that path. It&rsquo;s almost like you
got some good pointers. I think we can be a bit more explicit on go here,
start here, do this. I like the idea that&rsquo;s the path that we would promote
both with the people that we hired or the people that we want to hire
because at least it&rsquo;s fair. Also we allow that talent to be proactive and to
say look, I started here but I&rsquo;m already here.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Yeah, okay, we&rsquo;ll have that in mind to add here.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
I totally agree with Surbhi, but I have another way also. Like if we can
call for a person for a journal interview and let them know what we are
actually looking for and on what projects we are working, what
technology they are looking for and give them. Some deadline, like for one
month and something according to your requirement and give them a
chance at least so they can go back and learn about something. After a
month you can have a session again and according to that, you can find
out that how a person is eager to learn and what can the person can learn.
This could also solve a problem of unemployed person, like directly say,
no, you are not matching with our requirements because we are also
looking for a job. I think if this thing is happening, the companies maybe it
will solve the problem of unemployment.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Yeah, cool. No, I like it. I was just checking the chat. I don&rsquo;t think we have
billy, you want to ask a question? Sorry, let me make you co host. Give me
a second and.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Sorry, I.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Think that&rsquo;s the other question. I&rsquo;m just sorry, I&rsquo;m just making him a co
host because I don&rsquo;t think.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
I there is one person. Hanson.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Yeah, I just need to log in quickly as the host. Okay, sorry, you can share
now. Go ahead. Actually, sorry. Now you can.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Hi Billy.</p><p>Billy:
Yeah, first, I really love what Kiran was saying there about having a list of
things companies want to see in a prospective employee or like a new hire.
Also what Dennis was saying about having a criteria or a curriculum, I
would really love to see a curriculum of different skills for the different
types of roles because I&rsquo;m also just learning about cybersecurity, but I&rsquo;m
just kind of going with what I can see at the moment. Starting on Try
Hack Me, I just started learning about learning Python, just different
things like that. I would really love to have a direction and that&rsquo;s
something that I would really love to see in the future, either from
prospective employers that are looking to hire in the security field or even
just from the industry professionals. Just to show if you&rsquo;re looking for this
type of a career in cybersecurity, you should focus on these right now.</p><p>Billy:
That way I think that would really help a lot of people just getting the ball
rolling on their training.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Yeah, Billy, I totally agree because I think that applying for jobs from
being an outsider and I have worked with in cybersecurity. My past
experience is that learning is fine, reading theory is fine, but until unless
you have an hands on experience, that is not going to help. I should say
thankfully that there are options right now which we can explore, which
provide us hands on experience. Like try hack me to take that for an
example. Now it has various courses from beginners to advanced level,
right. I could literally follow the instructions and exploit a particular
vulnerability to get that flag. I was eager to earn that flag and from in
that process I could learn about that vulnerability. I personally think that it
is very important that the employers understand this point to give chance
to the people who are eager to join cybersecurity.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Because when I go for a job search and I see that in an entry level, it
requires three years of experience. Four years of experience, five years of
experience. Right. So even I am not very clear. Why is this experience
required? Because I join as with a zero level, zero experience, right. I learn
everything on the ground in the organization. I would learn much faster in
that way. I think everybody can learn much faster if they are given a
chance. Basically, what Kevin said, even I agree with that. My thinking is
that there should be specifically clarity what is exactly expected from us?
How should we proceed? Yeah, absolutely.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
The main is to give a chance first and let employees explore. Maybe it will,
because it works.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Right.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
I had a lot of success, right, of bringing people that didn&rsquo;t have a lot of
experience in cybersecurity. What they had was the passion. Right. The
challenge, I find, is how to do that in a fair way, doing the job interview
process, right. There&rsquo;s a school of thought that we shouldn&rsquo;t be giving a
lot of homework or a lot of tasks to the candidates. My thinking is actually
the more tasks we do and there&rsquo;s a little difference between tasks and paid
work.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Right.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
I&rsquo;m not saying we should give them unpaid work, but I think that the more
tasks and the more paths we can give to the candidates, the more we can
distinguish between the ones that really want to do it and the ones that
think it&rsquo;s a good idea. Because actually we now have an interesting curse
where because the salary margin is so good now in cybersecurity, the
premium is so good there&rsquo;s, people say, oh, cool, I&rsquo;ll go into that.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Right?</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
I think almost I would argue that&rsquo;s not who we want. Who we want is the
people that want to do that because they have a passion. They found a
place that it&rsquo;s really interesting. There&rsquo;s something in cybersecurity and
the world is so big. In cybersecurity, you can always find an area. You can
go from compliance to testing, to planning, to architecture, development,
engineering.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Finding.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Problems, fixing problems like literature, you name it, right? What we
need to do is find something that you&rsquo;re very passionate about and also
have the confidence that you will add a lot of value by just having
experiences that most people in our industry don&rsquo;t have. That&rsquo;s why we
need the diversity of thinking. We need diversity of thoughts. That comes
from individuals that have different experience, they have different life
experience, have different thinkings. Right? A mom actually has the type
of experiences that others don&rsquo;t have. Hiring moms that have raised kids,
maybe now they pass the age where the kids don&rsquo;t kill themselves if you
don&rsquo;t keep an eye on them every day, right? Then they are amazing talent,
right. They haven&rsquo;t worked for five years, for example, or they haven&rsquo;t
worked in the industry. So how do we get them in? Some of it is actually
impostor syndrome.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
You haven&rsquo;t really talked a lot of it, but I have also seen a lot of impostor
syndrome, which is very frustrating because I believe in the individuals. I
just want the individuals to believe more in themselves. Right. To know
that you might not have the exact technical skills, but the skills that you
have, the common sense and the experience is what we really need
industry.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Yeah, I agree with you, Denis. The thing is, I think the only way is giving
them a chance through internships, maybe, and proving themselves. I
think this is the best goal.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Yeah, but internships are tough when for somebody more senior, right?
Let&rsquo;s say somebody works as a doctor on an emergency hospital, right? An
E, right? That person knows how to deal with pressure.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Correct.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Talk about somebody who knows how to deal with crazy situations.
Everything is flying around. What do you focus that&rsquo;s who you want as an
instant responder, right? Like, that person will be amazing in
cybersecurity, right? You can&rsquo;t give them an intern job, right? Because that
person might be quite senior ready. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of talent that fits
into it. Talent that could be great at cybersecurity, especially in the mid to
senior roles. That kind of we need to find a way to give them simpler roles
without having seniority, that they can use their skills, but then give them
the time to basically be able to hold their own in cybersecurity.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Okay, so if I say in this way, like taking your example, a doctor who is
doing an operation or delivery and he wants to become a part of
cybersecurity, but you are saying that he is much experienced to give an
internship, right? Still, he&rsquo;s a beginner in cybersecurity, right? You are a
beginner in any industry, you start from zero. I think that having a basic
knowledge is very important. When you are starting, because in
cybersecurity, it is very important that you learn the fundamentals. If he
wants to enter himself into cybersecurity, he&rsquo;s very well aware of the fact
that he will be starting from beginner level. He is a beginner. Right. I don&rsquo;t
think according to me, there might not be a problem. But if you are trying
to we.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
Can say that it depends on your priority. Like if you can choose a salary
package or you can choose your opportunity. If you go with the like, I&rsquo;m a
five year experience, I can&rsquo;t take an entry level position. It means you are
not eager to learn new things. It means you are more focused on surgery.
So I think. So you have to prioritize your things. What is more important
for your experience or you want to learn something new? I think it is a
personal level who can think in what way. Like if I talk about myself, I
have five years teaching experience. Now I move to it and I&rsquo;m totally new
to this, it background and all. If I expect I have five experience, I can&rsquo;t do
entry level job, then I don&rsquo;t think I can ever go into the It and get a job.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
So it depends upon me how I.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Take this, how you approach certain specifications. Because ultimately
you are a beginner, you enter into any field or if I.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
Say I am an engineer, I want to doctor. I even don&rsquo;t know how to do
stitches for that I have also go to entry level for every area or every
industry. If you are new, you have to start from zero and it is nothing
wrong in that, I guess.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Yeah, I get that but I think.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
That.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
I feel that&rsquo;s the bit that I don&rsquo;t think we have good examples or good paths
like you said, right? Because I feel that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s available today. But that
doesn&rsquo;t work in practice. It doesn&rsquo;t work in practice for somebody who
already have a career responsibilities basically, right? If you&rsquo;re just out of
university, right, you can afford to do an internship, right?</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
Because probably or another way we can do in this way like we don&rsquo;t left
our job first and side by we are giving extra time to learn more technology.
You think that you are capable of that then you should move to next job
and asking for like I have this experience so I should go for this. So this is
another way we can.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Say, and I think most of the people do like this only, right? They continue
learning new skills with the job they are already doing.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
We&rsquo;re saying that maybe we should have these part time openings to give
people the ability to do it part time in extra bits, so they can learn, get the
experience, have real world experience in these activities and then do the
move. That could be an interesting offering, right?</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
If we can, because we all know that every profession requires certain
amount of dedication and cybersecurity requires continuous learning,
right? It&rsquo;s like one needs to be very sure that he or she has to be a part of
cybersecurity and for that, according to me, they should have some
experience to decide.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Like that phrase you said cybersecurity does require dedication, right?
Maybe that&rsquo;s what we should be already pushing early on to say look, if
you don&rsquo;t have dedication to jump these initial hoops, right, then it&rsquo;s not
going to work for you because this is just the beginning of that path.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
I think it&rsquo;s high time for the industry to address these challenges and
create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
The.</p><p>Billy:
I was just thinking for technical roles we have ways of testing that such as
try hack me, pack the box, things like that, GitHub if you&rsquo;re a coder, that
kind of stuff. What if people who are looking to hire people for entry level
cybersecurity roles in a more technical field, what if they set up their own
a mini try hack me thing, for people that are just looking to so that way
they could have it so that you could log into a virtual machine, try to hack
it, or do whatever their assignment is. If you&rsquo;re for coding, maybe they
could ask you to supply a script that would do a specific function,
something like that, just for various technical things that they&rsquo;re looking
for. Maybe set up docker containers or something on Amazon web services
in like a virtual environment kind of a thing, just so they can see that
people have those abilities.</p><p>Billy:
Once if someone can complete those abilities, at least to some degree, then
that would allow that company or that company would then allow that
person to submit a resume or they could get their information to further
speak to them about a potential role. I think a lot of them they&rsquo;re asking
for resumes and from my understanding, most of the time they don&rsquo;t even
look at most of the resumes, just toss them aside and that&rsquo;s someone&rsquo;s
chance right there just getting thrown out. This way as well, if they do it
like this, they could make it anonymous so that they don&rsquo;t know who is
completing all the challenges, they just know that they&rsquo;ve done them and
that way it removes any bias from the decision right off the get go. I think
that would really help with getting them a diverse set of applicants right
then and there just because it&rsquo;s strictly by what they can do, what they can
prove that they can do.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Yeah, I completely agree with you. Like you said that you&rsquo;re applying two
jobs and we are not sure whether our resume are properly looked upon or
not. I completely agree with you and we are actually focusing on just
giving a chance because somebody who is an expert in this industry at
once was given a chance, right? Someone has to start from somewhere for
starting somewhere we want that chance. I&rsquo;m saying like that because you
can&rsquo;t become an expert until and unless you gain experience on a
particular thing and there are many things which you learn while you are
in an organization in real time. Okay, so my appeal is only that, yes, we
can go through a curriculum, we can go through creating virtual
machines. That organization give us this chance of solving particular like
capture the flag or something like that. But we should be given chance for.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
An entry level job. They are asking for some hands on cloud technology
three years experience for entry level job. How can they expect hands on
now?</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
I think they will be able to answer this question.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Well, look, I think that if somebody is asking for that, then it&rsquo;s already not
the right employee. I put job specs in the past where we literally would
have in the job spec saying you don&rsquo;t need service experience for this job,
right? Like apply. And we had some great candidates, right? I think it&rsquo;s
also on the employees, right. I think if the employee is open to hire people
without cybersecurity experience because they&rsquo;re going after a certain
type of talent, then they need to be explicit. And I think that&rsquo;s the key.
Right? It&rsquo;s a bit like if somebody says you need to have three years
experience with chat GBT, right? You already know they&rsquo;re clueless. Right.
It&rsquo;s the same thing. Right. But you have that, right? You always have these
jobs where they want to I remember there was Net, you need to have five
years experience in Net.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
We&rsquo;re like, dude.net, was released two years ago, right?</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Yeah.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
You always have this. I think it&rsquo;s up to the employee to basically put good
JDS out there because, look, it&rsquo;s a privilege, right. We want companies
that view the talent that they&rsquo;re hiring as talent, not as numbers or as
quantity. Right? You want to find companies who think like that. The good
news is that the cybersecurity market at the moment is so hot that it&rsquo;s
probably the easiest time to get into the industry, right, because you can
literally hack your way into it. You can literally deliver on the job, right,
because there&rsquo;s such a demand. The good news is the pay is good, right.
It&rsquo;s not even like you have to go in a massive desert before you even get
this amount of money, right? There&rsquo;s a lot of great talent, there&rsquo;s a lot of
skill shortage. I kind of agree when you were saying that the people that
want to do the job need to show a level of productivity, need to show a
level of putting some skin in the game, right, to show that they are
committed to do the jump.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
Yeah.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
And even one, please.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
Yeah.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
I just wanted to being clear, because I&rsquo;m not the employer, I wanted to
know how an employer thinks about it. Now, in a cybersecurity company,
when you are hiring, right, you already have some experts who an existing
Sock team or existing vulnerability assessment team who is already doing
their work, right? If you hire a person who has basic knowledge or who
has little bit experience, meanwhile the existing team is handling the
operations, that person can learn. Right. What is the fare in hiring a
person who has, I mean, basic level of experience? I just want to
understand this point because there&rsquo;s already a cybersecurity team which
is doing their job. Maybe the beginner level can be given a chance to learn
from them, because I learned in that way. I wanted to ask, what is the
current scenario?</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
But why do they do charity? Why they hire internship?</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
I&rsquo;m talking about internships.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
Internship, you can say, but for a job, I think nobody can do no.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
I&rsquo;m talking about internships. Can we do this in this manner?</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Well, you can. To be honest, if you have internships and early entry jobs,
and if somebody applies with that, which clearly has crazy experience
right. I would argue that person has a big competitive advantage. Right.
It&rsquo;s a bit like you&rsquo;re already hiring people that don&rsquo;t have clear experience.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Why?</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
It&rsquo;s an internship or a junior role. If somebody appears in there that says,
I&rsquo;ve run teams of 2030 people. I know how to work here, I&rsquo;m an architect,
I know how to build a house, I&rsquo;m a lawyer, I have a PhD or I have a degree
on psychology. Right. All those things are insane assets. Right. I don&rsquo;t
think that&rsquo;s the gap that we have. Right. That market already kind of
exists, but I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s enough people joining the market because
the ones we need to attract, especially on a diverse and women more
specifically. Right. We don&rsquo;t have a good funnel. If you look at the number
of kids in schools, you still have 90% males in computing course. Right.
You still have cybersecurity courses. It&rsquo;s still very male dominated, so it&rsquo;s
already skewed from the start. The reality is that I think we need to be
finding talents that already has graduated, that already done other
careers that maybe haven&rsquo;t found their calling.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Right. And security is a great career. It&rsquo;s a great industry, and we need to
find paths for those individuals. The individuals that have gone a career,
have spent 35, 10, 20 years, 30 years in a particular industry and now
want to go to cybersecurity. Like I said, internships does not work for
them. We won&rsquo;t find them with internships because they will be too. Also,
in a weird way, if somebody has a level of experience, you want to give
them a mandate, right? You give them good challenges. You want to say,
look, you might not have cybersecurity experience, but how to run a
meeting. How to run a team, how to deal under pressure, how to think
logic, how to read the GDPR standard and not fall asleep and be excited
about it. That&rsquo;s the challenge that we need to give to those individuals.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Okay.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
I think now it&rsquo;s time for employers to rethink the process of hiring a
person and starting to give a newcomer a chance if we move the
unemployment from the society.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Yeah, but I think Billy, you mentioned right, like the impostor syndrome.
Right? It&rsquo;s real. Right. It&rsquo;s, for me, very frustrating because I think most
individuals sometimes don&rsquo;t understand where they add value. I&rsquo;m telling
you, man, as an employee and as somebody who leads teams and I hire
quite a bit and I work with other people, a lot of times the technical skills
are important, but that&rsquo;s not the main thing. Right. It&rsquo;s how people think
and how they learn, how they interact, how they respond under pressure,
how they have clarity of thought, how they learn, how they&rsquo;re curious
about learning. Right. Those skills are way more important than whatever
you happen to land or whatever you happen to be paid to do, which is on
your CV.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Right, exactly. Yes.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
Agreed with you.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Totally.</p><p>Billy:
I also was listening recently to a podcast where they had a guest on who
claims he had his majors, he had his Master&rsquo;s degree in cybersecurity and
he cannot find a job. That would be soul crushing, going through that
much work and not being able to find work.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Okay. I can have you brutal on my answer. I don&rsquo;t know the individual.</p><p>Billy:
I&rsquo;m willing to bet I know the answer, though.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
There has to be another reason. Nothing to do with cybersecurity.</p><p>Billy:
That&rsquo;s a possibility. Yeah.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Or going for roles that are crazy. Again, having a Master of Cybersecurity
experience doesn&rsquo;t mean you can take any jobs. Right. For me, it just
means that you are able to actually do something that is very good
academic. To be honest, in cybersecurity, it&rsquo;s actually really good for, a
reasonable, not small, but not large amount of cybersecurity roles. It
depends what role he&rsquo;s applying for. He or she, I don&rsquo;t know. We have
close to 0% unemployment in cybersecurity. Right. If he had a degree on
an esoteric. Right. Kind of. Okay, I&rsquo;m going to make up a degree because
there&rsquo;s always a crazy degree that people do. Right. If you have a degree, I
don&rsquo;t know of creating lamppost. Right. Because I&rsquo;m actually seeing a
lamppost now. Right. You can&rsquo;t find a job because you took a Master&rsquo;s in
creating lampposts, I think. Yes. You may be struggling to find jobs.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Right. If you have a degree in cybersecurity and you&rsquo;re struggling to find a
job, then there&rsquo;s something else that is not working. There&rsquo;s something
else I play.</p><p>Billy:
Yeah.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Sorry. I don&rsquo;t know. Not in 2023.</p><p>Billy:
Yeah. I don&rsquo;t know too much about the context there, but it did kind of
catch me by surprise.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Yeah, but that&rsquo;s like people that take a degree and go and work on a
checkout and supermarket. Right. Which, to be honest, there&rsquo;s nothing
wrong with it. Right. It&rsquo;s a job. Right. Again, how you have your attitude
on it, but at the end of the day, you have to think strategic about your
career. If you take a university degree on a job that doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of
market opportunity, then sorry, there&rsquo;s literally a market economics at play
here. Yeah.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
It also depends on like he has masters of in cybersecurity and he&rsquo;s
applying for a job, but we don&rsquo;t know if he getting calls for interview. Like
he has attended any interview and then rejected. Or in my case, I have also
the same, but if I get selected for the interview, then they reject it. That is
something wrong in me. Like, I couldn&rsquo;t clear the interview. What if you
are applying and nobody and you are not getting calls for the interview?
Then where you are wrong? What is the problem?</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Well, to be honest, look, one of the things that I always ask on our jobs
applicants, I asked the candidates to create a presentation about
themselves. Right. We debate a lot about it. My point is that CVS are a
horrible way to review people. Right. Again, you have to take into account
that when people will have a job, and if you have 50 people, 100 people
applying for a job, let&rsquo;s say, ultimately you have to have a CV that stands
out. Right. I like a presentation because it allows you to expose more
about who you are and what you do. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s about, for
example, having public participation. I don&rsquo;t think we mentioned a lot
here, but like, open source projects are a great way to get experience.
Right. Look, the summit, I know a lot of people who got jobs because they
did presentations at the Open City Summit during COVID There was a
couple of amazing individuals that got furloughed and they contributed a
lot.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Their career skyrocket because they were mass involved in the summit.
They helped, they met a lot of people. There&rsquo;s lots of ways that you can
start to hack your way into the industry. Right. Again, the fact that there&rsquo;s
a lot of jobs in cybersecurity doesn&rsquo;t mean you get a free pass. Right. You
still have to work really hard and you have to earn your spot because
ultimately it&rsquo;s a competition. Right?</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
You&rsquo;re right, Dennis. I think maybe me and Karen will find a way and we&rsquo;ll
come back to you.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Yeah, look, but this is important, right? I think sessions like this, they
make a difference. Right. Again, even from you&rsquo;re building a brand, you&rsquo;re
creating connections, you expanding and you&rsquo;re learning. That&rsquo;s who you
want, right? That&rsquo;s who you want to hire, and that&rsquo;s how you grow. Right.
I think it&rsquo;s about making it fair for the right candidates.</p><p>Kiran Gandhi:
Thank you. I think next time we will participate in panel discussion.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
We can do that.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Absolutely. There are a lot of people we can bring. There&rsquo;s some amazing
individuals. I always mentioned Petra because she&rsquo;s one of my rock stars.
That, again, she was a doctor. Right now is an amazing cybersecurity
manager professional, and let&rsquo;s bring talent in. Let&rsquo;s have a panel about,
again, the evolution and thinking and good examples on career paths.
Maybe what we could do is let&rsquo;s work maybe together on those examples
of where to start. Right? Like, if you want to start here and, collect
materials from OAS, from other things so that we can basically have a
nice path or almost like journeys for the individuals that want to jump into
cybersecurity.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Yeah.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
There you go. There&rsquo;s our project for the next couple of months. And you
guys going to be involved?</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Yeah? Yes, me. Sure.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Brilliant. Okay, cool. Look, thanks for participating.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
I hope our session was informational and people learned from it. Little bit.</p><p>Dinis Cruz:
Brilliant.</p><p>Surbhi Gupta:
Thank you.</p><p>Billy:
Absolutely.
