Hi, welcome to this open security summit session. In April 2023, we&rsquo;re
going to be talking about risk in the monetary space. We got some high
super experienced hyper knowledge panelists here. Maybe Isaac give a
quick intro and Marius and then.</p><p>Marius Poskus
Hi, guys. My name is Marius vice president of cybersecurity for global
financial services. Yeah, been around Cyber for a little while. Heavily
involved in building risk treatment plans in modern tech space. Hopefully
we have an interesting conversation with the guys this evening.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Yeah.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Me, I&rsquo;m a senior staff engineer at Datadog and focusing on the security
products over there. Lately for the last ten or so years been discussing this
risk thing quite a lot, both from the side of the customer, like figuring out
what is risk, and from the side of the producer saying, how are you going
to explain risk to other people? As we can see, Dennis was in the middle of
a very risky operation, trying to go from one place.</p><p>Marius Poskus
To another in the rain.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
I&rsquo;m cycling through Central London. It&rsquo;s less risky these days. Man they&rsquo;re
cycling now. It&rsquo;s very civilized. When I was the risk analysis 15 years ago
was way worse than now, right? For me, risk, I think I had a number of
epiphanies on risk, I guess, in my journey, especially once I can start to
visualize and think of risk as graphs and then maps. I guess one of the
reasons me and these already had several of worldly map sessions, right?
Marius do you want to take that one first? When I realized that you can
think of it also has maps, you have a huge amount of context. I feel like
for me, the big interest here is how do you make this scale? Which is also
why I think things like GPT, like technologies are probably one of the
missing pieces of the puzzle because it allows us to process data and
maybe tree maps if you want it like that in a much more scalable and
pragmatic way, but also in a way to customize the message to the
audience.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Why don&rsquo;t we kind of start there, right, like in terms of how to capture risk
and then present it so that the audience understands the risk that they&rsquo;re
taking and makes good risk decisions.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Myers do you want to take that one first?</p><p>Marius Poskus
Yeah, well, I think the problem normally I think we face because if we
start talking about qualitative risk management, it normally starts with
somewhere finger in the wind, because normally you do a three x three
five x five matrix. You have to start some ways, and then once you develop
enough of the risks and enough of the framework around it, then you can
gauge in between how we define what&rsquo;s risky and what&rsquo;s not. I guess we
define what do we care about by qualitative risk management and then we
define by quantitative risk management whether it&rsquo;s worth doing or not.
That&rsquo;s normally I see organizations kind of marry those two. The problem
is, I think nowadays and I see a lot, actually the last few posts that I&rsquo;ve
been talking with some professionals in this space. The problem is how do
you report risk further up the chain and how do you get buy in?</p><p>Marius Poskus
Because the problem is normally I see some security professionals, they
report things like vulnerabilities, found incidents because they can&rsquo;t define
how to report risks and how to put it in tangent numbers so the board will
understand. That&rsquo;s when I think that normally the problems arise. I don&rsquo;t
know what your experience with eyes are, but that&rsquo;s where I see the big
problems normally happening.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
I agree with you completely and it&rsquo;s interesting that immediately you took
the risk to the board and I agree that&rsquo;s usually where we see this thing
expressed. Those are the people who apparently are the most interested in
risk, at least in the quantitative side of risk. Actually you just popped that
in my head. If we take it to the other side, to the developer, they are more
interested in the qualitative side of risk, right? That&rsquo;s where I think that
the notion of risk becomes more important than the definition of risk. I
mean, the formal definition that I have always been taught is that risk
equals probability times impact. Impact is usually dollars, right?
Probability is whatever between zero and one. So risk in that equation
becomes dollars. One thing that I have noticed is that come to a developer
and talk to them about risk in terms of dollars, they&rsquo;re not really
interested.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
They&rsquo;re interested to know is this bad, is this good? You pop into info low,
medium, high, critical. Right! That&rsquo;s when you fall back into the
probability times impact. Well, there&rsquo;s a probability of X that this impact is
going to happen. The next question that they ask you is why? That&rsquo;s where
people start moving their hands very fast in the air because basically
nobody knows the probability.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Right?</p><p>Izar Tarandach
We don&rsquo;t know what the probability of attack is. It depends on so many
things and so many things that we absolutely have no control over. Denise,
you were going to say something, you garbled.</p><p>Marius Poskus
I think he&rsquo;s gone, so I&rsquo;m going.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
To go to my ramp. We are losing.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
I can hear you guys.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
The winds of London are stronger than you.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
All right. I was just moving around.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Oh, that&rsquo;s better? Yeah.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Is that better? Yeah. Yes. No. Cool. Yeah. What I was saying is that I think
you jumped massively right there, right? Because yes. There&rsquo;s a number of
risks that I think it&rsquo;s hard to measure the probability. Right, fair enough.
Right. I would argue that these days you have lots of data, right? There&rsquo;s
lots of data that you can start to make some very good fact based analysis
on your environment, on the company that you work for. You have, man.
Whatever company you work for has a history of incidents, right? Well,
you should have okay, if you&rsquo;re telling me that I just arrived at a company
they haven&rsquo;t, then be doing cybersecurity.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
No. Even if they have, what does that tell me about the future?</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Not necessarily. If you give me a mapping on what are your threat agents,
right? What kind of attacks you see, what attack surface you have, what is
the business model of the attackers. I can already tell you to a certain
degree the kind of vulnerabilities, the kind of exploits you will have. Right.
Like what kind of monitoring you have in place, what kind of impact you
have.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
You are asking for a huge job of threat intelligence to come back at the
same list of vulnerabilities that we keep going back to all the time. So just
fix those.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
No, because you need context, right? Because the vulnerabilities depends
on context. A vulnerability is just in fact, a lot of businesses have
vulnerabilities by design, right. Like their business model is a f******
vulnerability. Right.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Let&rsquo;s say that your company had an ATO incident. Does that mean that the
next thing that you&rsquo;re going to have is an ATO incident? No, it means that
ATO incidents happen.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Sure.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
You don&rsquo;t know if the chance of the next one is 65% 95%. It will happen at
some point.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
No, it matters. Right? Because it depends how the ATO going there. Right.
For example, I think in risk we have to have a level of objectivity here.
Right. It&rsquo;s like, I found that if I don&rsquo;t have a data to support a point, let&rsquo;s
say, for example, inside the threat, right? You say that inside a threat is a
problem, let&rsquo;s say. Right, but I would argue in some companies there&rsquo;s no
evidence of insider threat. Also, if there was an inside malicious insider,
the amount of damage they could do is massive. Right. That company
current business model is based on them not having malicious insiders.
Now, that&rsquo;s an important distinction because you need to focus on what is
their real threats. Right? Because when you go and say, and this is why I
like that risk, quantifying the risk. Right. If you have a Pragmatic
conversation with boards and with execs, right.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
You need to be able to say, this is the things that we worry about. These
are things that we&rsquo;re not worried about. These are things that we cannot
do anything about unless you double our budget because we just don&rsquo;t
have the capacity. And that&rsquo;s a risk based conversation.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
I guess that my point. That at some point you stop talking about risk and
you start talking about priorities. Priorities are much easier to explain
than risk. The language of risk at some point connects itself to the
language of insurance. Right. That there is enough data out there to say
that a male of a certain age, of a certain background has X chances of
having a heart attack by I don&rsquo;t know when there is enough data for that.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Priority without risk.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
On the other hand, for risk, for our risk, a lot of what you see is casino
mat. It&rsquo;s people like Brooke famously says, it&rsquo;s casino math. You see
people like just throwing coins in the air and saying, dude, the chances of
an attack happening is X. Even having the data that you mentioned, the
context that you mentioned, which is very important, I agree with you. You
still don&rsquo;t come out with data that should be considered totally actionable.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Let&rsquo;s explore that concept of how can you set priorities without having a
good level of risk. Let me just define this. I like to think of risk as a series
of whys, right? Is the five whys. It&rsquo;s almost like it&rsquo;s a graph, right? You
start with a vulnerability. In fact, a vulnerability is a fact that has security
implications. Right. I want to say a fact is that server unpatched. That&rsquo;s a
fact. Right. I could say, well, that server is unpatched with this type of
thing that has a security vulnerability on it. Cool. Now you ask why does
that matter? Right. You keep asking why until you hit some very top level
items. Right? It could be that it matters because it holds highly
confidential data. Well, yeah. Then that matters. Right? It matters because
it&rsquo;s connected to the Internet.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
You see, it&rsquo;s what I said about the developer. You went into five wise. I said
the developer is going to two. So having those five is great.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
The five wise is how you go to the top and every five, every answer to a Y
is almost at a management layer, right?</p><p>Izar Tarandach
That&rsquo;s great. If at some point you don&rsquo;t come and say the probability is X
because you will never be able to support that X. That&rsquo;s my whole point.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Where you can define probability these days when you&rsquo;re hitting places
where the probability is really low, probably needs to be this is with more
or less risk appetite. Fair enough. In a lot of organizations, I would argue
that if you cannot make a valid logical reason why that&rsquo;s a f******
problem, right? Then the job, right?</p><p>Izar Tarandach
There you go.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
You should be able to right? Because you should say, look, you have a
freaking server connected to the Internet with a loan vulnerability. There&rsquo;s
none exploits. Five companies got exploited over there. There&rsquo;s a high
possibility that you&rsquo;re going to be hacked next, right?</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Versus, wait, I want to hear my view because he comes from an executive
point of view rather than the logic of the things that chain.</p><p>Marius Poskus
Mayus yeah, well, I always have a view because we&rsquo;ve been talking a lot
about risk in terms of actors and attacks. There&rsquo;s a much wider enterprise
risk that I consider when I start talking, because we start talking about
business continuity, planning, disaster recovery, we talk about obviously
threat actors. There&rsquo;s loads of other things that come into talking about
business impact analysis and critical systems that not necessarily talking
only about patches, but talking about business continuity of operations.
That&rsquo;s the key, I think. Especially nowadays, I work in the fintech space in
kind of new they don&rsquo;t have legacy systems. I&rsquo;m a big proponent as well
when we start talking about risk, because normally, even my post today, I
think I&rsquo;m a big proponent about creating a narrative. When you go to the
board, you need to know who you&rsquo;re talking to, you need to know the
language you need to use.</p><p>Marius Poskus
Security normally is always viewed as a cost center. How do you change
the narrative from becoming not only cost center, but becoming
potentially a money saving person, and secondly, becoming creating a
security solution programs and strategies to gain competitive advantage
against companies that you might be competing for tenders or competing
in the same environment? If you create a narrative, not only talking about
risk, but, as Isaiah mentioned, talking about probabilities, but talking
about how do we do security to gain competitive advantage? How do we
embed application security program into DevSecOps lifecycles? To make
our product the best in class so that every single client that comes and
puts their customer data with us, they are safe. That becomes much more
conversation, not only about risk, but about all of these other things. And I
think that&rsquo;s normally.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
What you just done with that is you anchor a lot of, I would say, top level
risks that you can use as leverage to put context into the risks at the
bottom. When you say, how do we get a developer to do X? First of all, the
developers don&rsquo;t do stuff because they like it or not. They&rsquo;ll do stuff
because on a f****** canban board, right? If it&rsquo;s not a Kanban board,
they&rsquo;re not going to do it. The developer is not even the most important
person to do is the PM is whoever owns a Kanban board. They&rsquo;re the ones
who need to take responsibility. I like what marriage you&rsquo;re talking about
has also taken into account the business continuity, like the business
elements, right? The business practice, the business properties, because
that&rsquo;s where it matters, right? You could argue that, for example, if I
change this in security, I&rsquo;m now reducing the risk of business continuity.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
That&rsquo;s a very valid reason to do it. That has a lot of strength, right?
Because it means that we&rsquo;re going to make these changes to some part of
the business, but we&rsquo;re going to improve not just the risk of data loss or
the risk of financial, but we&rsquo;re going to improve the risk of, for example,
disruption or lack of business continuity. And that&rsquo;s what I mean. The five.
Whys? Because when you follow the risk, you arrive at those at the top.
The key is to make sure that you have contact. That&rsquo;s the problem that
most people have. The problem that we have is that we don&rsquo;t easily
connect this action on the ground, which is reality, make this change,
patch this, fix this, make whatever to almost what is the business impact
actually positive or negative in the business? Right?! We need to be
following this in a data driven way and knowing something is data.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Right? Like, I could say I have no visibility on what the h*** happened
over there, so you have to accept the risk of debt.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
That to me, translates into the priority.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Right?</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Because as Mari said, the narrative is important, but the narrative is
important both at the board level and at the developer level. I agree with
you, developers who want to do what&rsquo;s on the Campbell board. The place
where we come and unfortunately, the narrative that we&rsquo;ve been using for
a long time is selling insurance. We say you do the same or terrible things
are going to happen.</p><p>Marius Poskus
The thing is, I just wanted to add this. We&rsquo;re talking about developers. I&rsquo;ve
been posting and talking a lot about developers and addressing potential
risks and, and building devs across frameworks. I think the problems
normally the people struggle. That because A, developers don&rsquo;t hate KPIs
in terms of looking at security, and B, normally to build an appsack
program, you need to build security into development culture. That can&rsquo;t
happen in three, six, or even twelve months. Sometimes. It&rsquo;s a big job to
teach developers to do threat modeling to them understand the risk, and
it&rsquo;s not easy.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
To Dennis point, yes, they will only do what&rsquo;s in the Camban board. The
question here is not what&rsquo;s in the Camban board is how do we get our
stuff in there? And that&rsquo;s true priorities.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
You use risk.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
The thing that you&rsquo;re proposing is more important than that next feature.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Yes. And you use risk ownership for that. The trick that we now start to
use, and then it works really well, is that every risk needs to be accepted.
The only variable is for how long? Right? The key here is to make the right
person and the right organization chart accept the risk. Because what
happens in most organizations, the security team is actually accepting a
lot of risks on behalf of the business. The way I look at this is that let&rsquo;s say
that I represent security team is that you represent the engineering
function and Mario, you represent the business function. Right. The way it
works is Marius comes along and says, we need to do X, right, for this
business objective, right. Either you come and you map a plan, you hire a
team, you&rsquo;re implementing it, security comes along, go, hey guys, there&rsquo;s
some side effects of security.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
We have to do this XYZ, right? The key here is to give the risk and the
whys of those risks, why is there a problem? Because this increases the
exposure of this exposure of that compromises, these bricks compliance
XYZ, and it&rsquo;s Marios who needs to accept the risk. Now in this example,
Mario, as a business owner, your only option is you want to accept the risk
for a day, for a week, for a month, for six months. Because what that
means is that Delta is how long you expect it to be done, right? If you say,
oh, I&rsquo;m not happy to accept this for more than two weeks, for example,
you can only do that if you already have an item in the backlog, right?
Because if that was on the backlog, there&rsquo;s no way it&rsquo;s going to be done in
two weeks. Even if you, from a business point of view, say, yeah, that&rsquo;s
quite harry, I&rsquo;m not comfortable with those risks.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
We can challenge you to say, yeah, but if you don&rsquo;t allocate resources in
Isa&rsquo;s team, which represents the engineering team, then you&rsquo;re going to
have to accept it for three months or six months or a month, because until
you allocate resources, that risk will still be there. That completely
changes because the problem I always have with risk is we don&rsquo;t make the
right people accountable for the decisions that they&rsquo;re making. Every time
you make somebody click on something, even adding an emoji to answer
or replying to an email, they know that we are making them accountable
because we&rsquo;re creating a digital trail. That, I think, is the key, is to create
a digital trail with a business owner for the risks that they&rsquo;re buying, so
they become accountable when those risks materialize.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
First of all, I&rsquo;m going to tell you I&rsquo;m a huge fan of personal accountability.
I love your approach.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Role with accountability, right? Role.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Yeah, let&rsquo;s say role. My problem is exactly with that we live in a reality
right now that people rotate very fast between jobs. Somebody in that role
accepted that risk. The next guy is going to come in, the first thing that he
receives is a bomb on his head of all the risks.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Absolutely. Yeah, exactly. That&rsquo;s exactly how it should be. Right. But today
what happens is the worst. Today what happens is a new person comes
along and they have no idea what this is inherited. By the way, the other
key element here is that when you give risk to an individual, you&rsquo;re not
giving the risk to that individual or that role, you&rsquo;re giving it to the whole
food chain. That means that you accept the risk on behalf of your
manager, on behalf of their manager. So the risk follow upwards, right?
Also we have also the power because we get to choose who ultimately is
the ultimate arbitrator of risk, right? Because we could say, hey, you need
to accept this, but your boss needs to underwrite it because actually this
has bigger implications. What we&rsquo;re doing is we&rsquo;re making the people
accountable at the right level of the organization.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
In your example, when the person leaves, guess what, their boss has all
their risks and ultimately ends up on the CEO or the board because all
risks have to go upwards.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Comes the question, are we creating a bit of institutional paralysis in
here? Because you&rsquo;re going to start a dialogue that goes up and down the
chain all the time. Do we accept this risk? Do we accept that risk? He
accepted that one, but his manager won&rsquo;t. Now they have to have a
discussion between them to see who accepts what.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
That&rsquo;s great. Today is the worst. You get that and officially with no
accountability, with people not paying attention because they know there&rsquo;s
no accountability.</p><p>Marius Poskus
I want to add a couple of things. I think in modern organizations, what we
try and do nowadays, you can preempt some of these things. So we started
building Security Champions Network. One thing to preempt the risks and
get visibility in various departments, but secondly, now organizations, and
I&rsquo;m a big fan of It, doing Cybersecurity Council. Normally before you take
things to the board, you have a council that is built up of management
team that has already pre approved your ideas and your solutions for risk.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Exactly.</p><p>Marius Poskus
And for everything else. Before it goes to the board, you already have a
big support behind your back.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
But that&rsquo;s key, right? The way this scales is that when you accept risks,
you&rsquo;re also accepting that level of risk across a particular so in a way, you
created authority, in a way correctly, actually accelerates the business
because you now know what risks you&rsquo;re willing to accept versus what
risks you&rsquo;re not willing to accept.</p><p>Marius Poskus
Yeah, it&rsquo;s probably similar as to thinking about AA language model. You
build a model because sometimes organizations, especially when you come
in and new, it&rsquo;s very hard to have a conversation of what&rsquo;s your risk
appetite because it goes up and down. Especially it depends which
department you&rsquo;re talking because obviously innovation and developers,
they&rsquo;re always going to be more risk takers because they&rsquo;re all absolutely
going to innovate. Whereas someone who&rsquo;s dealing with 2008 servers in It,
who&rsquo;s just daily standing one stick, they&rsquo;re not going to be as risk averse.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Yeah, and what you want is make sure that, for example, your startup
model does not have access to all the assets of the organization. I think
that&rsquo;s why risk is interesting, because you can go, hey, you guys want to go
100 miles an hour. You want to have these shortcuts, which I get it from a
developer point of view, but you now, for example, need to accept the risk
that you have access to all our customer data. Immediately, if you say that,
they&rsquo;re going to go, whoa, I don&rsquo;t want that risk, I don&rsquo;t want to have that
responsibility. Okay, fine, then let&rsquo;s limit that. Until you give them that risk,
they don&rsquo;t understand it, right? Even, for example, like GDPR, I had some
really cool cases where companies want to capture a lot of this data,
right? We basically said, okay, but if you capture all this data, you&rsquo;re going
to have to accept all these GDPR risks.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
You&rsquo;re going to have to accept all these things and all these requirements
that you now need to do, even something as simple as erasure data.
Erasure, right. When we gave them those risks, they start asking the
question, why are we capturing this data? Why do we need it? Do we
actually need this particular data for our business case? And they didn&rsquo;t.
Right. It was giving them the risk was a much more business friendly way
to say, look, we&rsquo;re not going to stay in front of what you want to do as a
business, but you need to be able to take accountability for the risk that
you&rsquo;re buying, for the business, for what you&rsquo;re doing.</p><p>Marius Poskus
That becomes a key sometimes even becomes people, I think struggle with
it becomes a key skill. How do you follow this trend? How do you ask
specific questions to get to the bottom of the truth? Because sometimes
people just get frustrated, oh, I can never get done with this and that, or
we can never do it. You get to the bottom of the root cause of why
something is happening, why there is a risk, why somebody has to accept
the risk, why there is because people sometimes forget, yes, data is king.
Data collection comes with so many responsibilities, and it&rsquo;s normally so
many regulations. Especially, it always says you only collect the data that
you need for your business operations, and if you don&rsquo;t, that becomes very
tricky.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
You can use risk to drive that. Yeah, imagine he&rsquo;s doing a thread model.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
And we lost him again.</p><p>Marius Poskus
Yeah.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Actually, I agree with everything that you guys are saying, but it&rsquo;s just that
all of a sudden risk is getting this huge profile, and all of a sudden you
need this huge operation around risk to identify, to justify, to manage.
Dennis, we completely lost you for the last 30 seconds.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
I can hear you guys. It&rsquo;s really weird. I can hear you guys.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
No, continue where you were. You are going to an interesting place.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Go. Yeah, look, I think the idea is that you need to make for that to scale,
you have to actually going just to the point you were saying this doesn&rsquo;t
work if it doesn&rsquo;t scale. Right. That&rsquo;s why I like the whole GPT stuff and
it&rsquo;s the chat GPT stuff. The next generation where you can feed it lots of
data is the first time that I can see this can really scale because it can
scale from the point of view of imagine feeding it all the GDPR. Feeding it.
All of us, 27,000 feeding it. Also AWS best practices plus ASVs from OAS
plus maturity model and say. Okay, now, here&rsquo;s my data. Now what&rsquo;s my
priorities? Or how do I put context into this particular risk that I have
here? Right? More importantly, how do I then translate it to the multiple
audiences that I need to communicate it to?</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Okay, that first part there, I&rsquo;m allergic to the idea how to communicate.
I&rsquo;m totally for. To let that kind of model make decisions for me at this
point.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
In the technology I didn&rsquo;t say make decisions, I say give me contact.</p><p>Marius Poskus
I think loads of things. Depends how you build your enterprise risk
management framework. Because, for example, I&rsquo;m a big fan that we have
a risk co, but we only talk about risk, about the top things. I have a cyber
risk register which houses however many risks. The ones that go to Risco
is the ones that within the context, within now and today we need to
address. The thing is, the key point is it&rsquo;s always changing. Things are
happening, risk grows up and down. The one key thing as well, sometimes
I want to mention that I think sometimes people really forget. You
mentioned Dennis about accepting risk. Yeah, accepting risk or accepting
risk with an end date in mind. But there&rsquo;s another thing. Sometimes
people, when they reach a risk that goes to an acceptable level, they close
it. You never close the risk because no, you accept it.</p><p>Marius Poskus
Something you added and the risk profile changed completely and now it
became from low risk, became medium, and then all of a sudden, another
month later became a high risk.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Yeah, but that&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t close it. You accept it. It&rsquo;s very different.</p><p>Marius Poskus
Yeah.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
You don&rsquo;t close it. You accept it, and that&rsquo;s very different. I&rsquo;m stuck on
that.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Well, closing a risk implies it&rsquo;s done, right? Implies that we got rid of it.
Right? I would say close is close to eliminate because you can eliminate
some risks, right. Or put this right. You can bring it to the level where
they&rsquo;re not statistically significant. Right. You don&rsquo;t have to care about it.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Accepting is saying, I can live with it and it&rsquo;s under my risk appetite.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Exactly.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
And I&rsquo;m not going to fix it.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Yes, but I&rsquo;m taking responsibility for it. Because that&rsquo;s what the business
does every day. Every business executive every day makes business
acceptance decisions. I invest here, I invest there, I live with this, I&rsquo;m roll
the dice here. I&rsquo;m hoping that will happen. All those are risks, but what
they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re accepting the risk. What we&rsquo;re doing here is
formalizing that, but we&rsquo;re formalizing so that they&rsquo;re accountable. What
teach you about this is notice how so many business risk decisions are
made in meetings. Sometimes it&rsquo;s like you will say, XYZ, and somebody
very senior goes, I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with that. That&rsquo;s a risk decision. At
that moment in time, they just said, I don&rsquo;t want to do this. What you need
to give them is that little piece of paper going, Cool, then go on a record,
right?</p><p>Marius Poskus
Yeah, we did that before as well. What we do sometimes as well, we
underpin, for example, a cybersecurity program based on level of threat.
Sophistication so we say, for example, me, as a company, I say, I can&rsquo;t
invest enough money to prevent state sponsored threat actors so we can
work up to the level of cybercrime, but I&rsquo;m not going to try and invest
millions and millions to prevent from state sponsored threat actors
because it will just not be financially viable.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Or you haven&rsquo;t hit them, right? Or you haven&rsquo;t got to the point where
you&rsquo;ve been compromised by a state actor and the board asking you
protect us from them, right? But you&rsquo;d be a very different company. Think
about what you just there was. You create a risk decision. The risk
decision is that we&rsquo;re not going to protect ourselves against state
sponsored actors with this kind of sophistication but that&rsquo;s the risk
decision.</p><p>Marius Poskus
Yeah, of course.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
That&rsquo;s when I would say, well, you can do it for six months, for a year,
because in principally, it&rsquo;s not going to change, but you can keep going
down, right? You can then say, I&rsquo;m not going to protect myself against
highly sophisticated actors. Or, for example, you can say, I&rsquo;m not going to
protect ourselves against activists because we have a great brand, because
our brand does not have activists hitting it, and because I have no
evidence at the moment of being hit by activists, right. Or the other round,
right? I&rsquo;m not going to protect ourselves against commercially driven
actors because it&rsquo;s really hard to make money with our digital access, but
I&rsquo;m going to protect ourselves against activists because we kept f******
being hit all the time by that. But those are risk decisions.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Dennis I feel like I have to throw a bit of a bucket of cold water in this
because you&rsquo;re describing this amazing framework where you have access
to all kinds of intelligence and understanding and you have these people
sitting up in the top saying, we will need to accept this and this is our
tractor. Meanwhile, I have a developer that I can&rsquo;t even stop doing an
SQLi. Okay? We&rsquo;re building the whole risk treatment factory here, while
at the ground level, we are not getting the most basic risks.</p><p>Marius Poskus
Killed.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
We had ten years ago.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
No, but then yes and no. Right, okay, start with that guy. Right, okay. You
have a developer creating SQL injection. All right? Does it matter what&rsquo;s
the implications of that SQL injection?</p><p>Marius Poskus
Yeah, there&rsquo;s a few things obviously yeah, you have to answer, right? What
kind of data is he working exactly? Is there going to be sensitive data? I
think there&rsquo;s two ways you can angle it, isn&rsquo;t it? I always tell people you
work top down and bottom up. Bottom up, you obviously find out about
the data is working. Does this matter? Secondly, normally when I build an
appsack program, you have to get development managers on board,
where you have to go to them, you have to build security KPIs. We have to
talk because I hate about there&rsquo;s one thing normally that breaks down
when we talk about developers fixing security stuff. We go into their
world, we bring our security tools, we go into their platforms, whether
they work in Jira, wherever they work, we bring the platforms to the Jira.
We create a context, we prioritize, we create risks we can&rsquo;t do from SAS,
output 10,000 tickets and try and solve it.</p><p>Marius Poskus
No, you go to context, you marry that with SAS, Dast and Sea, and you
create a risk narrative. What&rsquo;s the impact of this particular? What data is
going touch? What app is going to work with? You create KPIs with the
people that are going to manage those developers, and you work together
to create a plan.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
What&rsquo;s the top five things we want them to fix next week? Right? We
should be able to give them that, right?</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Let me close that loop for a second. We started with the divide between
risk from the point of view of the board and from the point of view of the
developer. Now we are bringing that together, saying there is a
framework, somebody decides the risk appetite, and now the developer
has to execute based on that. Where in you guys mind sits the decider of
what is it that the developer will do next based on that risk profile, who is
the function, what&rsquo;s the role that actually gets to decide what goes next?</p><p>Marius Poskus
It depends how you build. I&rsquo;ve normally done frameworks, and I&rsquo;ve been a
big of a fan of what AWS does. I normally build plans similar to what they
do. You have a development team, say, of teams are built off six, seven,
eight people, whatever it is. You have a security champion in each
development team. There&rsquo;s the person who you gather them all and you
teach them about risk, about the impact, about the likelihood, and they
will become your essentially threat modeling champions. And they will
identify the risk. You create they call it a security bar or a level of where
the risk is. If that risk exceeds that level, there is an escalation point. So
you create AbSec engineers. Normally I will say one engineer per three
development teams. So that gets escalated. We do a second round of
threat modeling to see if we can reduce that.</p><p>Marius Poskus
There is a penetration test and a a gateway into release, into production.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
To me, you&rsquo;re describing a near verna situation where in the best of all
known words, that would be the that&rsquo;s.</p><p>Marius Poskus
The framework, you know, getting there. That&rsquo;s why I said to you, getting
there is normally that&rsquo;s why I say to people think, oh, we&rsquo;re going to start
doing AppSec. Yeah, but normally that framework until it&rsquo;s operational. I
always say to people, it&rsquo;s 18 months. Developers, when they haven&rsquo;t done
security, you can&rsquo;t just say, oh, we&rsquo;re going to start doing security
tomorrow. It&rsquo;s a cultural shift. It takes effort, it takes training. You create
security champions. Do you think these people want to be security
champions for nothing? You have to create reward programs. Like, we
send all of us to something like Black Hat, RSH. There&rsquo;s tangible rewards.
You become a security specialist on a team. You hire, obviously, the
secured AppSec, security engineers. You bring all the tools. The tooling is
fine. Fine tuning the tooling and force positives, force negatives. That
takes however many months to get to the point.</p><p>Marius Poskus
This all reaches a combination in 18 months. You get somewhere close to
what you say is an Irana no, I love what you&rsquo;re selling.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
I think that&rsquo;s definitely like paradise sounds like that, but my God, we are
so far from paradise. How many companies do you know that actually do
exactly what you&rsquo;re describing?</p><p>Marius Poskus
You can count on figures.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
When you finish training those people in those roles, they move. They&rsquo;re
just gone. So, I mean, we need something that we can use immediately.
Like somebody just came in, got on board. It, dude, this is risk for us here.
These are priorities. This is what you do, this is what you don&rsquo;t. We don&rsquo;t
have time to build that huge runway to get to the desired.</p><p>Marius Poskus
I think that&rsquo;s where we are heading that way because we starting to bring
security tools into development. IDE. We start in going away from going
to the boards and stuff like that. Nowadays, developer types code, and in
IDE, it gets straight away pointers to raise. And now they&rsquo;re even adding
risk. You&rsquo;re just quantifying and creating some framework of what needs
fixing now versus you can push into production and we accept the risk.
There&rsquo;s a timeline for the fix. You just probably quantify critical high, we
fix now and then medium lows, you have a time limit. You built in SLAs
and it can go into production because then you prevent from them
innovate. You&rsquo;re not preventing them from innovating but at the same time
you&rsquo;re keeping security in terms.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Is this the time when.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
We I just wanted to add a comment on when you said about who owns the
risk. I think yes. The closer you can be to the technology teams and the
engineering teams, the better. Right. I have to say that these days there&rsquo;s a
much bigger realization by engineering that they need to be secure. Right.
I think Al.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
I feel like these are the best parts of what he has to say.</p><p>Marius Poskus
I think he just presses something like I&rsquo;ve got great idea. Let me press a
button to freeze.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
There&rsquo;s probably an app for that.</p><p>Marius Poskus
Must be something in there.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
I&rsquo;m going on a rain.</p><p>Marius Poskus
Here you go. There&rsquo;s no reception.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Yeah, I&rsquo;m on a South Bank in London. Can you guys hear me now? I think
he&rsquo;s taking the idea of.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Mobile way too far.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Yeah, I think you need to give it to the business owner. Right. You need to
give it to the person who controls the development, the pipeline. Those are
the ones who have to own the risk. The key is to make it official. And it&rsquo;s
not easy, man. It takes a lot of time and effort, but I think that&rsquo;s the
direction of travel is to give them the risks to accept. Yeah.</p><p>Marius Poskus
Because definitely sometimes people even forget to the point we
mentioned kind of thing you mentioned in the beginning saying security
owns too many risks. Security shouldn&rsquo;t own even a single risk. Security is
a consultative function to the business that provides you provide ideas
what business to do. If any of the risks are owned by security, then I would
say you&rsquo;re doing something wrong.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
Totally agreed.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Yeah. The only risks that we should own are the risks that we need to own
from our own business function outside of security for the security tools,
for example, that we push, then we need to own those risks. Yeah.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
And you know what?</p><p>Diniz Cruz
As a business owner, as a business owner, that&rsquo;s the risk we should own,
not the business risks.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
I think that mars you touch on a really important point that we as security
people have to make peace with we are not as important as we think. We
are here for consultancy.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Right.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
So we don&rsquo;t have to own risk. We shouldn&rsquo;t. And if we are doing it wrong.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
I agree with the second part, not the first part, but I think we are a very
important part of the fruit.</p><p>Marius Poskus
We are very important but people forget we&rsquo;re not there to because
sometimes we create such stories about the risk that might prevent
business operations. We&rsquo;re not there to stop business operations because
of risks but now we are there to enable business and make those
operations just more secure and that&rsquo;s the key point. Sometimes people,
especially people in senior cybersecurity positions, they keep saying no.
The problem is, the more you say no, the less likely you are to be listened
to. At some point, you lose the seat by the table and then you get
frustrated because you can&rsquo;t do anything because you caused it yourself.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Well, look, I tell the board and the senior executive says, my job is not to
prevent incidents, my job is to prevent crisis. Right. Our job is not to make
this secure, is to make it safe. And it&rsquo;s a very different proposition. Cool.
Guys, look, top of the hour. Any final thoughts? This is a great session. We
need to do more of these. Love the session.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
You should make a different event. Dinners in the park where you talk.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
To people.</p><p>Marius Poskus
Playing banjo and talking about security.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Actually, I&rsquo;m about to go to an event here in London with tons of security
professionals. I should go there and get them on here.</p><p>Marius Poskus
Yeah, exactly.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
I&rsquo;m going to assist our event. Cool. Any final words, guys?</p><p>Izar Tarandach
It&rsquo;s a risky business.</p><p>Marius Poskus
It&rsquo;s risky business. I think the main point will be touching. It&rsquo;s a journey
and it takes a lot of work to get to a certain level of risk, treatment,
maturity. It needs a change of thought, a change of narrative and a
change of approach. Yes. I always say to people, there is one key saying
here, stop doing the same things if you expect different outcome.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
Exactly.</p><p>Marius Poskus
That&rsquo;s what we need to keep. We need some fresh ideas, we need fresh
outlook of how we address the risk going forward.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
The best part, we work in an industry that can still be super passionate
about what we do, love what we do and make a difference. Right. Come
on, that&rsquo;s awesome.</p><p>Marius Poskus
Exactly. It&rsquo;s all about making a difference. I think just a caveat to that, I
think the industry itself is probably nothing like anywhere else you would
meet, because I&rsquo;ve never met so many individuals that do stuff out of
passion, serve their time and efforts to help others without any rewards.
I&rsquo;ve been involved loads in mentoring and all kinds of things, and they&rsquo;re
rewarding. You always say, Just pay it forward. I&rsquo;ve never seen that
anywhere in such a magnitude as in cybersecurity.</p><p>Diniz Cruz
I agree. It&rsquo;s a great industry to be part of. Man all right, guys, catch you
later.</p><p>Izar Tarandach
