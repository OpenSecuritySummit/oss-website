While it does have much merit and has influenced security in an indispensable way, I argue that “shift left” should be viewed as a tactic in a larger management strategy rather than a comprehensive solution to solve application security woes. Just as software development is a very complicated process with many layers, “shift left” should not be viewed as a straightforward, linear effort.</description></item><item><title>Application Security vulnerabilities - measurements, maturity magic - Vulnerability Framework Project</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/application-security-vulnerabilities-measurements-maturity-magic-vulnerability-framework-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/application-security-vulnerabilities-measurements-maturity-magic-vulnerability-framework-project/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Behaviour Change and Awareness</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/behaviour-change-and-awareness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/behaviour-change-and-awareness/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT - What &amp; How (Hands-on Session)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/chatgpt/chatgpt_how_to_use_it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/chatgpt/chatgpt_how_to_use_it/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT impact on Cyber and Application Security (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/chatgpt/chatgpt_impact_on_cyber_security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/chatgpt/chatgpt_impact_on_cyber_security/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Conducting effective Table Top Exercises for Cyber Incident Response Practise (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/conducting-effective-table-top-exercises-for-cyber-incident-response-practise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/conducting-effective-table-top-exercises-for-cyber-incident-response-practise/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity assessments: finding the way forward</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/cybersecurity-assessments-finding-the-way-forward/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/cybersecurity-assessments-finding-the-way-forward/</guid><description>About this session &amp;ldquo;Big enterprises, startups, scaleups, mature in security and just starting their journey - we all from time to time find ourselves in a situation when we wonder what&amp;rsquo;s next? What should we do to make this company secure? Are we doing the right thing? Cybersecurity assessments help to get the answers and find a way forward. We will talk about frameworks and approaches, how to start self-assessments and what to look for in third party offers if you need help.</description></item><item><title>GitLab Security Tools (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/panel-gitlab-security-tools/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/panel-gitlab-security-tools/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Language content negotiation, where it's going (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/language-content-negotiation-where-its-where-its-going/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/language-content-negotiation-where-its-where-its-going/</guid><description>About this session Language Content Negotiation (LCN) is a critical aspect of web application security. LCN is a process of selecting the language and content that a web server will respond to a client&amp;rsquo;s request with. It is essential for websites to provide appropriate content in the user&amp;rsquo;s preferred language to enhance their user experience. However, this process can be exploited by attackers, leading to various security vulnerabilities.
This session will discuss the current state of LCN and its future direction.</description></item><item><title>Open Security Summit Awards and plans for 2023</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/oss/open-security-summit-awards-and-2023-plans/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/oss/open-security-summit-awards-and-2023-plans/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Protect Your Application, Not Just the Network - add Zero Trust Superpowers to Your Critical Applications and Systems</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/protect-your-application-not-just-the-network-add-zero-trust-superpowers-to-your-critical-applications-and-systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/protect-your-application-not-just-the-network-add-zero-trust-superpowers-to-your-critical-applications-and-systems/</guid><description>About the session: Applications are the new edge and zero trust is the security industry’s latest hot buzzword. Most solutions are closed source and try to protect the network. Securing the network isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. Adding zero trust directly to your app is the future and the best way to keep your mission-critical systems secure and running. Zero trust overlay networking can be embedded into your application making the security of the network entirely irrelevant - the isolated application will have zero trust of the internet, local and host OS network.</description></item><item><title>Risk Acceptance and OISRU (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/risk-acceptance-and-oisru/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/risk-acceptance-and-oisru/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Security Vendors - Operating Model</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/security-vendors-operating-model/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/security-vendors-operating-model/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Taking Your DevOps Tooling To The Dark Side</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/taking-your-devops-tooling-to-the-dark-side/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/taking-your-devops-tooling-to-the-dark-side/</guid><description>About the session: &amp;ldquo;We support battle-hardened production applications every day, but do we hold ourselves accountable to the same standard with our own tools?

We can&amp;rsquo;t go a week without hearing about another database leak. What if we could access these databases using strong identities and zero-trust principles?
That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what you can do quickly and easily using OpenZiti&amp;rsquo;s zero trust JDBC. Not only can you add the OpenZiti JDBC directly to your app for zero-trust access, but you can also add it to your favorite SQL editors and access the DB over a zero-trust overlay network with no VPN.</description></item></channel></rss>
