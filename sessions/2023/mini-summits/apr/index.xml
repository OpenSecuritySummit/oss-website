While it does have much merit and has influenced security in an indispensable way, I argue that “shift left” should be viewed as a tactic in a larger management strategy rather than a comprehensive solution to solve application security woes. Just as software development is a very complicated process with many layers, “shift left” should not be viewed as a straightforward, linear effort.</description></item><item><title>Application Security vulnerabilities - measurements, maturity magic - Vulnerability Framework Project</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/application-security-vulnerabilities-measurements-maturity-magic-vulnerability-framework-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/application-security-vulnerabilities-measurements-maturity-magic-vulnerability-framework-project/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Behaviour Change and Awareness (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/behaviour-change-and-awareness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/behaviour-change-and-awareness/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Conducting effective Table Top Exercises for Cyber Incident Response Practise (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/conducting-effective-table-top-exercises-for-cyber-incident-response-practise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/conducting-effective-table-top-exercises-for-cyber-incident-response-practise/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity assessments: finding the way forward</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/cybersecurity-assessments-finding-the-way-forward/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/cybersecurity-assessments-finding-the-way-forward/</guid><description>About this session &amp;ldquo;Big enterprises, startups, scaleups, mature in security and just starting their journey - we all from time to time find ourselves in a situation when we wonder what&amp;rsquo;s next?

Most solutions are closed source and try to protect the network. Securing the network isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. Adding zero trust directly to your app is the future and the best way to keep your mission-critical systems secure and running. Zero trust overlay networking can be embedded into your application making the security of the network entirely irrelevant - the isolated application will have zero trust of the internet, local and host OS network.</description></item><item><title>Risk treatment planning in modern tech space (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/risk-treatment-planning-in-modern-tech-space/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/risk-treatment-planning-in-modern-tech-space/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>The Truth about suffering a cyber-attack</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/the-truth-about-suffering-a-cyber-attack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/the-truth-about-suffering-a-cyber-attack/</guid><description>In this session we will focus on what really happens when your business suffers a cyberattack Get an honest understanding of:
