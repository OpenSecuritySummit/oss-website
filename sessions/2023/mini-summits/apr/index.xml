While it does have much merit and has influenced security in an indispensable way, I argue that “shift left” should be viewed as a tactic in a larger management strategy rather than a comprehensive solution to solve application security woes. Just as software development is a very complicated process with many layers, “shift left” should not be viewed as a straightforward, linear effort.</description></item><item><title>Application Security vulnerabilities - measurements, maturity magic - Vulnerability Framework Project</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/application-security-vulnerabilities-measurements-maturity-magic-vulnerability-framework-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/application-security-vulnerabilities-measurements-maturity-magic-vulnerability-framework-project/</guid><description>About this session Learn about the framework: https://phoenix.security/vulnerability-management-framework/</description></item><item><title>Behaviour Change and Awareness</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/behaviour-change-and-awareness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/behaviour-change-and-awareness/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT impact on Cyber and Application Security (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/chatgpt/chatgpt_impact_on_cyber_security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/chatgpt/chatgpt_impact_on_cyber_security/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT: Cyber Risks &amp; How to Harden Against Them</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/chatgpt/chatgpt-cyber-risks--how-to-harden-against-them/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/chatgpt/chatgpt-cyber-risks--how-to-harden-against-them/</guid><description>About this session In this panel, we will further explore the ChatGPT cyber risks and potential misuse by attackers, how to prevent these were possible, and harden the attack surface, as well as part of detection and response.</description></item><item><title>Conducting effective Table Top Exercises for Cyber Incident Response Practise (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/conducting-effective-table-top-exercises-for-cyber-incident-response-practise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/conducting-effective-table-top-exercises-for-cyber-incident-response-practise/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity assessments: finding the way forward</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/cybersecurity-assessments-finding-the-way-forward/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/cybersecurity-assessments-finding-the-way-forward/</guid><description>About this session &amp;ldquo;Big enterprises, startups, scaleups, mature in security and just starting their journey - we all from time to time find ourselves in a situation when we wonder what&amp;rsquo;s next?

We will talk about frameworks and approaches, how to start self-assessments and what to look for in third party offers if you need help.</description></item><item><title>Risk treatment planning in modern tech space (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/risk-treatment-planning-in-modern-tech-space/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/risk-treatment-planning-in-modern-tech-space/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Security Vendors - Operating Model</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/security-vendors-operating-model/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/security-vendors-operating-model/</guid><description>Session Transcript Dinis Cruz:
Hi. Welcome to this open security summit session in April 2023. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about security vendors operating model and hopefully set up the beginning of a nice, again, community infrastructure for us to have a much more productive relationship with a lot of the vendors and really ratchet up right where the states or where we currently are. So I&amp;rsquo;m Denis. I&amp;rsquo;m the chief scientist of Glasswall.</description></item><item><title>The Truth about suffering a cyber-attack</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/the-truth-about-suffering-a-cyber-attack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/the-truth-about-suffering-a-cyber-attack/</guid><description>In this session we will focus on what really happens when your business suffers a cyberattack Get an honest understanding of:
the reality of facing an outbreak the impact on your staff the harm to your business operations the struggle to recovery the damaging long term affects The real-world costs to a business of falling victim to cyber-crime Get an insight into where CISO&amp;rsquo;s and CTO&amp;rsquo;s fail, your weak spots and the hardest areas to protect.</description></item><item><title>Threat Modeling Kata</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-kata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-kata/</guid><description>About this session Katas are great ways to practice the movements of martial arts. They allow the practitioners to gain muscle knowledge to get more fluid movements. The same principle has been proposed by Neal Ford and others for System architecture. In this session we will a) Take a kata excercise from https://nealford.com/katas/list.html b) Create an architecture to satisfy the requirements c) Threat model this architecture and rate findings. This will be a working session open to newbies and experienced practitioners, where we will work together in creating the architecture and the threat model.</description></item><item><title>Women kick off in Cybersecurity</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/women-kick-off-in-cybersecurity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/governance/women-kick-off-in-cybersecurity/</guid><description>Session Transcript Dinis Cruz: Hi. Welcome to the last session in Open City Summit. April 2023. We&amp;rsquo;re going to end with a bang on actually a super massively important topic, which we&amp;rsquo;ve done a whole bunch of sessions before. I&amp;rsquo;m very glad that Kieran and Subi are going to continue their thinking and give us some really great case studies on really woman kickoff inside security, which I&amp;rsquo;m a big defender and I really believe we need to get a lot more talent and a lot more women in cybersecurity.</description></item><item><title>Zero Trust Database Access Using OpenZiti and JDBC</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/zero-trust-database-access-using-openziti-and-jdbc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2023/mini-summits/apr/devsecops/zero-trust-database-access-using-openziti-and-jdbc/</guid><description>About the session: Securing your database is incredibly important and easy to get wrong. We can&amp;rsquo;t go a week without hearing about another database leak. What if we could access these databases using strong identities and zero-trust principles?
That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what you can do quickly and easily using OpenZiti&amp;rsquo;s zero trust JDBC. Not only can you add the OpenZiti JDBC directly to your app for zero-trust access, but you can also add it to your favorite SQL editors and access the DB over a zero-trust overlay network with no VPN.</description></item></channel></rss>
