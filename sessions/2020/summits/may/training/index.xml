We will discuss how these apps work, some concerns about the way these work, and an overview of the reception these apps have had.

About this talk: Inspection and Sanitisation Guidance standards allow us to analyze elements and objects contained within the file structures, reveal the data hiding, data attack, and data disclosure risks. They show how identified elements can be a cause for concern for hiding sensitive data to ensure that files are safer for users to open and conform to the specification.</description></item><item><title>Identity Management &amp; Secret Stores</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/cloud-security/identity-management-and-secret-stores/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/cloud-security/identity-management-and-secret-stores/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Incident Scenario Exercise</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/ciso-and-risk-management/incident-scenario-exercise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/ciso-and-risk-management/incident-scenario-exercise/</guid><description>This is the third section in a four-part exercise: Part 1 -threat modeling Setting the scene to the further sessions.

This can be found at https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/pattern-safely-importing-data
The pattern fundamentally recommends a Transform and Verify approach to imports as shown below:
This has some significant differences to import processes typically in use in commercial environments.
The objective of this session is to raise the awareness of this pattern, highlight the differences in the pattern and the pros/cons of them, and to explore the practicalities of using this patter in commercial environments.</description></item><item><title>O365 Security - Anti-Phishing best practises and Demo</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/hacking-and-defending/o365-security-anti-phishing-best-practises-and-demo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/hacking-and-defending/o365-security-anti-phishing-best-practises-and-demo/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Office Documents ISG - How to automate Inspection and Sanitization Guidance testing</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-office-docs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-office-docs/</guid><description>About this talk: Once learning about the potential areas of concern that exist within office documents and exploring ISGs for them, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to discover the testing strategies that will be oriented on validation of the requirements of the ISGs.

we will take a quick tour through the OWASP flagship project that claims to be &amp;ldquo;probably the most sophisticated vulnerable web application!&amp;rdquo;
Starting with a &amp;ldquo;happy path&amp;rdquo; shopping tour we will then learn what security flaws lurk beneath the shiny web UI surface!
You will also learn about the CTF support, hacking instructor scripts, tutorial mode, dos and don&amp;rsquo;ts and some technical background of the project!</description></item><item><title>OWASP Juice Shop Introduction</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/owasp-juice-shop/owasp-juiceshop-introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/owasp-juice-shop/owasp-juiceshop-introduction/</guid><description>Notable logs from the chat during the session 17:21:39 From Jannik : Fun Fact: The Hacking Instructor was merged during last year&amp;rsquo;s Open Security Summit :slightly_smiling_face: 17:36:48 From Rusty : He&amp;rsquo;s using this framework 17:36:49 From Rusty : https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf/releases/tag/v8.1.0 17:51:16 From N/A : Bjorn (sorry no umlaut on my keyboard :) ) is there any official walkthrough with all vulnerabilities and how to exploit them?

Data helps companies and businesses grow, expand and improve their products and services, constantly apply innovations, better serve their customers and gain new ones.
While more and more companies gather data and share, store and access various files, it becomes vital to analyze files, spot unknown threats and struggle with malicious content.</description></item><item><title>What security exploits are prevented by implementing ISGs</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-security-expoit-protection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-security-expoit-protection/</guid><description>About this talk: Cyber attackers want access to the user&amp;rsquo;s sensitive information or intellectual property for strategic advantage, or more commonly, for monetary gain. They commonly attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the user&amp;rsquo;s computer system and network by using malware delivered via email or web servers.
This session will be dedicated to a discussion of the security exploits that can be prevented by applying ISGs.
