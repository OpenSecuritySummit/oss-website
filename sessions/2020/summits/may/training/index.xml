About this talk: Inspection and Sanitisation Guidance standards allow us to analyze elements and objects contained within the file structures, reveal the data hiding, data attack, and data disclosure risks. They show how identified elements can be a cause for concern for hiding sensitive data to ensure that files are safer for users to open and conform to the specification.</description></item><item><title>Identity Management &amp; Secret Stores</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/cloud-security/identity-management-and-secret-stores/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/cloud-security/identity-management-and-secret-stores/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Incident Scenario Exercise</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/ciso-and-risk-management/incident-scenario-exercise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/ciso-and-risk-management/incident-scenario-exercise/</guid><description>This is the third section in a four-part exercise: Part 1 -threat modeling Setting the scene to the further sessions.

This can be found at https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/pattern-safely-importing-data
The pattern fundamentally recommends a Transform and Verify approach to imports as shown below:
This has some significant differences to import processes typically in use in commercial environments.
The objective of this session is to raise the awareness of this pattern, highlight the differences in the pattern and the pros/cons of them, and to explore the practicalities of using this patter in commercial environments.</description></item><item><title>O365 Security - Anti-Phishing best practises and Demo</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/hacking-and-defending/o365-security-anti-phishing-best-practises-and-demo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/hacking-and-defending/o365-security-anti-phishing-best-practises-and-demo/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Office Documents ISG - How to automate Inspection and Sanitization Guidance testing</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-office-docs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-office-docs/</guid><description>About this talk: Once learning about the potential areas of concern that exist within office documents and exploring ISGs for them, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to discover the testing strategies that will be oriented on validation of the requirements of the ISGs.

we will take a quick tour through the OWASP flagship project that claims to be &amp;ldquo;probably the most sophisticated vulnerable web application!&amp;rdquo;
Starting with a &amp;ldquo;happy path&amp;rdquo; shopping tour we will then learn what security flaws lurk beneath the shiny web UI surface!
You will also learn about the CTF support, hacking instructor scripts, tutorial mode, dos and don&amp;rsquo;ts and some technical background of the project!</description></item><item><title>Owning AppSec Automation with Python</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/devsecops/owning-app-sec-automation-with-python/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/devsecops/owning-app-sec-automation-with-python/</guid><description>Notable logs from the chat during the session 14:39:25 From Abhay Bhargav : https://github.com/we45 14:57:18 From Didar Gelici : this is their repo where you can find some robot framework related tools 14:57:32 From Didar Gelici : and also robotframework.org for the overview and cheatsheets 14:39:40 From Abhay Bhargav : https://github.com/we45/oss-live-code 14:46:18 From Didar Gelici : Abhay and we45 also have a lot of good tutorials on their youtube channel, check it out after the session : https://www.</description></item><item><title>PDF ISG - Inspection and Sanitization Guidance for Portable Document Format and JPG ISG - How to automate Inspection and Sanitization Guidance testing</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-pdf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-pdf/</guid><description>Notable logs from the chat during the session 00:32:02 WallabyCurtis: Yara: https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara yextend: https://github.com/BayshoreNetworks/yextend &amp;ldquo;A curated list of awesome YARA rules, tools, and resources.&amp;quot;: https://github.com/InQuest/awesome-yara https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writingrules.html#regular-expressions https://www.cs.yale.edu/flint/cs422/doc/art-of-asm/pdf/CH16.PDF 00:43:17 Vinh Tram: http://giflib.sourceforge.net/whatsinagif/bits_and_bytes.html 00:51:35 WallabyCurtis: https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writingrules.html#regular-expressions

The rules of improv comedy can apply to many social interactions, including bluffing your way to compromise a target.</description></item><item><title>SOCIAL - Cards Against Humanity game</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/social/social-cards-against-humanity-game/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/social/social-cards-against-humanity-game/</guid><description>About this talk: Cards Against Humanity game (up to 50 players) for those who are not easily offended!?

In such attacks, the victim is not the ultimate target of the attack, but rather a stepping stone to other larger networks. In this talk, I will present an overview of enterprise cyber risk and supply chain attacks and delve into various attack patterns, specific cases, lessons learned, challenges and mitigations.</description></item><item><title>Team Topologies &amp; Compliance as code</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/misc/team-topologies-compliance-as-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/misc/team-topologies-compliance-as-code/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Threat Modeling - Cloud Functions as Detonation Chambers</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-cloud-detonation-chambers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-cloud-detonation-chambers/</guid><description>About this talk: In this session, we&amp;rsquo;ll do threat modelling for using a cloud funtion as a detonation chamber. A detonation chamber as defined by NIST, is an ideal capability for providing vulnerability shielding.

The protocol is used to extend proxy servers and investigation is ongoing on how to integrate CDR technology with Proxy companies like F5 through ICAP to allow safe transfer of documents accross domains. We&amp;rsquo;ll be doing a threat model to better undertand potential vulnerabilities.

Data helps companies and businesses grow, expand and improve their products and services, constantly apply innovations, better serve their customers and gain new ones.
While more and more companies gather data and share, store and access various files, it becomes vital to analyze files, spot unknown threats and struggle with malicious content.</description></item><item><title>What security exploits are prevented by implementing ISGs</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-security-expoit-protection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-security-expoit-protection/</guid><description>About this talk: Cyber attackers want access to the user&amp;rsquo;s sensitive information or intellectual property for strategic advantage, or more commonly, for monetary gain. They commonly attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the user&amp;rsquo;s computer system and network by using malware delivered via email or web servers.
This session will be dedicated to a discussion of the security exploits that can be prevented by applying ISGs.
