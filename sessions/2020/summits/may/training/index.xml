&lt;p>11:40:59	 From Sam Stepanyan : OWASP DefectDojo - open source vulnerability management tool: &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-defectdojo/">https://owasp.org/www-project-defectdojo/&lt;/a> &lt;br>
11:43:38	 From Didar Gelici : OWASP projects and content are the best friends of any devsecops person. We love you OWASP!
11:45:39	 From Shivani : what are the open source tool for DAST which companies are using? &lt;br>
11:47:22	 From Sam Stepanyan : - OWASP ZAP is a free DAST tool from OWASP (it is like Burp Suite, but free) : &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/">https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/&lt;/a> &lt;br>
11:48:00	 From shubham.m : Does Github also having CI/CD capabilities? Or we can achieve CICD by using Jenkins?
11:48:53	 From Raghav Rao : Github has &lt;br>
11:48:54	 From Muhammad Yuga : for GitHub it calls GitHub Actions &lt;br>
11:54:55	 From Taj : when I&amp;rsquo;m doing sast and dast in DevSecOps. am I expected to know the programing language on which the project is build? for example one project is on java other on python other on dotnet. so am I expected to know them to do saat and dast as part of devsecops? &lt;br>
12:44:35	 From Taj : devsecops pipeline in test shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be similar to production right?? then can you give a example of what should be enabled in production devsecops pipeline.? &lt;br>
12:44:57	 From Taj : and what should be disabled?? &lt;br>
12:46:20	 From Rostom Zouaghi : There are some compliance requirements where it is mandatory to test production systems but there are limitations to those tests of course, given they can affect the prod env. &lt;br>
12:46:30	 From Taj : yes that answers it. &lt;br>
12:49:08	 From Taj : In test environment. while I&amp;rsquo;m implementing dast in devsecops . then how can I configure when the build should fail, can you give an example.. &lt;br>
12:50:16	 From N/A : Is sslyze a good fit for a pipeline? I mean it is a tool that should be run from time to time. In my opinion not every time a pipeline runs since the server ssl configs are not constantly changing. What are your thoughts on that? &lt;br>
12:53:17	 From Raghav Rao : Do we run DAST scans for mobile apps in ci/cd pipeline as well? &lt;br>
12:53:18	 From N/A : Do you know any tool we can collect and see all pipeline results in a dashboard for example? &lt;br>
12:54:10	 From Raghav Rao : ArcherySec or Threadfix will help you do vulnerability management. &lt;br>
12:56:16	 From Didar Gelici : In test environment. while I&amp;rsquo;m implementing dast in devsecops . then how can I configure when the build should fail, can you give an example.. &lt;br>
12:57:04	 From Sam Stepanyan : OWASP DefectDojo is another popular free dashboard tool for vulnerability management. You can import scan results from many calls , display on one dashboard, obtain metrics and manage each finding
12:57:17	 From Shivani : Do we run Desktop application DAST testing? &lt;br>
13:05:25	 From Taj : while implementing dast in DevSecOps , what the strategy to eliminate false positives. because human intervention is needed to get false Positives. But if everytime human intervention is there don&amp;rsquo;t you think it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do proper justice to dev ops.?? &lt;br>
13:07:33	 From Sam Stepanyan : Re: Desktop apps - SAST tools which analyse the source code of application can provide better value from security point of view. There are commercial DAST tools which will analyse the EXE &amp;amp; DLL files. On the Open-Source scale the primary DAST tools are fuzzers. This is how many vulnerabilities in desktop apps like Acrobat Reader etc are discovered
13:09:06	 From Imran Mohammed : Awesome fuzzing&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dependency scanning lab</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/devsecops/dependency-scanning-lab/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/devsecops/dependency-scanning-lab/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="notable-logs-from-the-chat-during-the-session">Notable logs from the chat during the session&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>11:45:20	 From John : do all tools also check for dependencies that have been directly checked in - ie not in a package manifest (a problem with large old codebases) &lt;br>
12:00:50	 From Imran Mohammed : &lt;a href="https://portal.practical-devsecops.training/courses/sca-using-safety">https://portal.practical-devsecops.training/courses/sca-using-safety&lt;/a> &lt;br>
12:01:41	 From N/A : Imran, one problem I have is Time. If I put all this tools on the pipeline I would have a developers rebelion on the company xD &lt;br>
We spent alot of time reducing the time a pipeline runs, how can we add security tools to the pipeline without increasing pipeline running times &lt;br>
12:05:20	 From Jing : Hi Imran, which OAST tool can we use for .net and C++? &lt;br>
12:06:58	 From Raghav Rao : Flawfinder can be used for C++ &lt;br>
12:07:57	 From Raghav Rao : &lt;a href="https://security-code-scan.github.io/">https://security-code-scan.github.io/&lt;/a> —&amp;gt; .Net &lt;br>

12:13:20	 From Franziska : And: &lt;a href="https://devslop.co/">https://devslop.co/&lt;/a> &lt;br>
12:19:39	 From Manav : hey Imran, I didn&amp;rsquo;t provide any input file for retire, how does it know what&amp;rsquo;s the input file &lt;br>
12:23:44	 From Manav : I remember when I integrated dependency it downloaded NVD db &lt;br>
12:24:20	 From Manav : does retire does kind of same? or does it check in the fly making outbound internet connections? &lt;br>
12:27:11	 From N/A : Imran, I saw you are running tools like, nmap and nikto before deploying. &lt;br>
You are running those tools against a staging/dev server? Before deploying? &lt;br>
12:28:41	 From N/A : So, some tools like retirejs are run before a deploy and nmap/nikto are run after deploying? &lt;br>
12:28:58	 From Manav : when we run SAST.. with tools like checkmarks or Fortify.. I guess the library files aren&amp;rsquo;t included right?
12:29:27	 From Didar Gelici : &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxLweN1tBkoS4y73tJwWupuVsfgTQo-oV">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxLweN1tBkoS4y73tJwWupuVsfgTQo-oV&lt;/a> &lt;br>

12:53:15	 From N/A : Imran, where should we install the tools (retirees, niko, etc) in the machine that runs the runner? &lt;br>
12:58:11	 From Manav : we should ask for root account.. never problem with permission ;)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Drinks and Persona Building: Creating Adversary Trading Cards (1st Session)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/social/drinks-and-persona-building-creating-adversary-trading/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/social/drinks-and-persona-building-creating-adversary-trading/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="notable-logs-from-the-chat-during-the-session">Notable logs from the chat during the session&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Inspection and Sanitisation Guidance standards allow us to analyze elements and objects contained within the file structures, reveal the data hiding, data attack, and data disclosure risks. They show how identified elements can be a cause for concern for hiding sensitive data to ensure that files are safer for users to open and conform to the specification. Whilst getting acquainted to ISG standards in details in one of our sessions, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to measure and visualise these standards.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Identity Management &amp; Secret Stores</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/cloud-security/identity-management-and-secret-stores/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/cloud-security/identity-management-and-secret-stores/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->

&lt;p>01:08:25	Andreas Falk:	do you use the elevation of privilege card game in practice ? &lt;br>
01:14:17	Sebastian Schlesinger:	I often have the fear to miss something when doing threat modelling. STRIDE is good for brainstorming. But as I follow you in your explanation, a lot of implicit knowledge is required to memorise in which forms actually spoofing and tampering etc. can materialise. I used various sources - STRIDE, but also OWASP ASVS and NIST SP 800-53 controls to derive a guidance for the security workshop during which the DFD is developed etc., to help not forget anything. Are there other sources, like apparently this card game you just explained, to be taken into consideration to obtain an exhaustive guidance being able to cover all forms of threats that are conceivable? &lt;br>
01:14:49	InfosecMinion:	How would you incorporate privacy related element here? &lt;br>
01:15:26	Sebastian Schlesinger:	also good question. There is this Linddun framework &lt;a href="https://www.linddun.org">https://www.linddun.org&lt;/a> &lt;br>
01:18:14	Sebastian Schlesinger:	Sure, I agree. At the end it is some creative process and no &amp;ldquo;tool&amp;rdquo; or framework can cover everything. And everything that helps revealing something is useful at the end &lt;br>
01:18:44	Karl Petermichl:	How About the OISRU Open Information Security Risk Universe model by Phil HUggins and now open sourced? is it a good starting Point? &lt;br>
01:25:21	Andreas Falk:	how can i use threat modeling as part of agile scrum sprints? do I also look into this as part of my usual refinement process? &lt;br>
01:26:07	Karl Petermichl:	OISRU Framework Link: &lt;a href="https://github.com/oracuk/oisru">https://github.com/oracuk/oisru&lt;/a> &lt;br>
01:45:02	InfosecMinion:	Q: I am interested to know your process aftwerdwards, like once we documented the findings, what now?
01:46:59	Andreas Falk:	does it make sense to combine data flow models with attack trees, so create attack trees for possible threats found in the DFD &lt;br>

&lt;p>Jira is known as a task management tool, but for Glasswall it is a graphing database allowing us to mark and map anything we wish to. Combined with the power of Jupyter notebooks, we have stunning new ways to organize and visualize our data. Utlizing Jira’s API, secure authentication ensures that data doesn’t get into the wrong hands, and all the same flexible privilege options that we set in Jira will apply in Jupyter. In this session, you will see how with Python’s automation abilities, entire reports and dashboards can be built in clean and scalable ways, right from a simple notebook. You’ll see how graphs help visualize your workflow, and easily find what needs changing/improving. These changes can be implemented, and new nodes and edges can be added to our “map”, on a huge scale. We can neatly graph all of these Issues however we’d like - by their type, or by the link types they share with other issues, for example - or even store it in a clean Pandas dataframe. The consistency in Jira’s structure translates over seamlessly to code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LGTM in action</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/devsecops/lgtm-in-action/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/devsecops/lgtm-in-action/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="about-this-talk">About this talk&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>OWASP Juice Shop is an incredible tool to learn and teach about web
application security. The Juice Shop lets people attack a real(ish) web
application - which looks like a normal eCommerce Shop - and learn step
by step about some of the most impactful vulnerabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you are running a Security Training for developers based on the
Juice Shop you have one problem: How can every developer run and access
his own Juice Shop Instance to train his skills? The Juice Shop is
basically a single user application, so every user needs to have their
own instance to train.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NCSC - Safe File Import Pattern</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/ncsc-safe-file-import/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/ncsc-safe-file-import/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="about-this-talk">About this talk:&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Portable Document Format (PDF) is one of the most widely used file formats. In this session we&amp;rsquo;re going to explore ISGs for PDF files which will include inspection and analysis on various elements and objects that are contained within the PDF file structure and how they can be a cause for concern for either hiding sensitive data or attempts to exploit a system. We&amp;rsquo;ll analyze numerous features in PDF recommendations to mitigate these threats to provide a safer file.

&lt;p>Have you ever gotten an &amp;ldquo;urgent call about you car warranty&amp;rdquo; or a demand that &amp;ldquo;you need to pay the IRS by credit card right now&amp;rdquo;? Social Engineering is the practice of talking your way into or out of situations, and is often employed by the underhanded, but can also be used to defend against those very attacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rules of improv comedy can apply to many social interactions, including bluffing your way to compromise a target. The constantly changing situations of improv are great practice for accepting unexpected circumstances, and happily going with the flow.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SOCIAL - Cards Against Humanity game</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/social/social-cards-against-humanity-game/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/social/social-cards-against-humanity-game/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="about-this-talk">About this talk:&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Supply Chain Attacks are becoming increasingly widespread as cyber criminals seek to access sensitive data and systems through less secure third parties. In such attacks, the victim is not the ultimate target of the attack, but rather a stepping stone to other larger networks. In this talk, I will present an overview of enterprise cyber risk and supply chain attacks and delve into various attack patterns, specific cases, lessons learned, challenges and mitigations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Threat Modeling - Cloud Functions as Detonation Chambers - Part 1</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/hacking-and-defending/hacking-glasswall-sdk-and-cloud-thursday/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/hacking-and-defending/hacking-glasswall-sdk-and-cloud-thursday/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Threat Modeling - ICAP</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-icap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/threat-modeling/threat-modeling-icap/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="about-this-talk">About this talk:&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>00:39:26	DSB:	Is Glasswall Threat Model accessible to all, link you shared says &amp;ldquo;dsb@****.com don&amp;rsquo;t have access to Jira on glasswall.atlasssian.net&amp;rdquo; &lt;br>
00:42:07	Shivani:	Please give access to see this JIRA Task?? &lt;br>
00:42:14	Dinis Cruz:	https://os-summit.atlassian.net/ &lt;br>
00:43:15	Dinis Cruz:	i.e. we need help to move them over to this Jira envioronment &lt;br>
00:49:12	DSB:	Sec Champion should part of InfoSec Team or DevOps Team? I guess any, Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t having someone from DevOps team might give better results? &lt;br>
01:03:39	Uday-cfc010993:	can u help out with the third step &lt;br>

01:23:30	DSB:	If using MS products is not considered a sin Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool is available for free. :-). But I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is programmable like Threat Dragon. &lt;br>
01:24:24	Apoorva:	okay, just for clarification the Dragon Threat Model is a commercial product? &lt;br>
01:25:18	Shivani:	I think so it&amp;rsquo;s open source &lt;br>
01:25:32	Petra Vukmirović:	Threat Dragon is open source &lt;br>
01:33:08	F.P:	Hey guys, thanks for sharing this. I&amp;rsquo;m finding it hard to understand the starting point of the threat model. Assuming that in a first stage you don&amp;rsquo;t use any tools to automate the process / parse code. You are simply using a whiteboard. My questions are: &lt;br>
1 - Do you (as a security engineer) call everyone into the same room (devs, devops, product owners maybe), and start asking the questions OR you start alone by understanding the maximum you can, and then create multiple meetings with different teams to improve your model ? &lt;br>
2 - Assuming you are threat modeling a huge web application, with a variety of dependencies on different teams / third parties. Do you start by a really high level threat model of all journeys, or you pick one specific journey until you feel confortable with the final result ? &lt;br>
3 - A few times you mentioned you can zoom in on a specific process. How do you actually do this ? Does it mean you have a high level threat model and then multiple smal threat models ? are these all different files/ (edited)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wardley Maps introduction</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/wardley-maps/wardley-maps-introduction4/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-1/wardley-maps/wardley-maps-introduction4/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wardley Maps Introduction</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/wardley-maps/wardley-maps-thursday/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/wardley-maps/wardley-maps-thursday/</guid><description/></item><item><title>What are ISGs and how to convert ISGs into checklists?</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-converting-to-checklist/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-converting-to-checklist/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="about-this-talk">About this talk:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We live in an age where data has penetrated into all areas of our lives, where everything gets captured digitally. Data helps companies and businesses grow, expand and improve their products and services, constantly apply innovations, better serve their customers and gain new ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While more and more companies gather data and share, store and access various files, it becomes vital to analyze files, spot unknown threats and struggle with malicious content. Files inspection and sanitisation plays a significant role in reaching that goal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What security exploits are prevented by implementing ISGs</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-security-expoit-protection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2020/summits/may/training/week-2/security-standards/isg-security-expoit-protection/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="about-this-talk">About this talk:&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Cyber attackers want access to the user&amp;rsquo;s sensitive information or intellectual property for strategic advantage, or more commonly, for monetary gain. They commonly attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the user&amp;rsquo;s computer system and network by using malware delivered via email or web servers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This session will be dedicated to a discussion of the security exploits that can be prevented by applying ISGs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ISGs can be found in this publication repo: &lt;a href="https://nsacyber.github.io/publications.html">https://nsacyber.github.io/publications.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
