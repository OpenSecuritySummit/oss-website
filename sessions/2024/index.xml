It covers topics such as data protection, identity and access management, and the integration of security measures within cloud-native applications. The discussion emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to cloud security.
Outline Overview of the current cloud security landscape Data protection strategies in the cloud Identity and access management in cloud environments Security considerations for cloud-native applications Compliance and regulatory aspects of cloud security</description></item><item><title>Exploring A Risk Approach to Software Supply Chain Security</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/june/devsecops/exploring-a-riskapproach-to-software-supply-chain-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/june/devsecops/exploring-a-riskapproach-to-software-supply-chain-security/</guid><description>About this session Throughout the presentation, I&amp;rsquo;ll dive into software supply chain attacks and explain how they unfold incrementally. By understanding the latter, attendees will learn how to analyse their firms&amp;rsquo; internal processes for software ingestion, integration, and testing to account for Supply Risk both during and after deployment. Attendees will also understand how the risk-based model can respond to software supply chain attacks even when they are not detected until later in the internal software supply chain, and gain critical insight into the kinds of changes needed in their organisations&amp;rsquo; internal processes and software tools to support this approach.</description></item><item><title>IoT and Cyber Threat Intelligence: Staying Ahead of the Curve (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/feb/devsecops/iot-and-cyber-threat-intelligence-staying-ahead-of-the-curve/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/feb/devsecops/iot-and-cyber-threat-intelligence-staying-ahead-of-the-curve/</guid><description>About the session: This topic focuses on the integration of cyber threat intelligence with IoT security. It explores how organizations can leverage threat intelligence to proactively identify and mitigate potential risks in their IoT deployments. The discussion includes real-time monitoring, incident response, and the role of threat intelligence sharing.
Outline Understanding cyber threat intelligence Importance of threat intelligence in IoT security Real-time monitoring for IoT devices Incident response strategies for IoT incidents Threat intelligence sharing in the IoT community</description></item><item><title>Ransomware Resilience: Strategies for Prevention and Recovery (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/feb/devsecops/ransomware-resilience-strategies-for-prevention-and-recovery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/feb/devsecops/ransomware-resilience-strategies-for-prevention-and-recovery/</guid><description>About this session This topic addresses the increasing threat of ransomware attacks and explores proactive strategies for preventing such incidents and enhancing recovery capabilities. It delves into the latest trends in ransomware tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as effective countermeasures to mitigate the impact of these malicious campaigns.
