Panelists will discuss the importance of hands-on assessments, challenges in designing effective practical evaluations, and techniques for assessing candidates&amp;rsquo; ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
Outline: Importance of practical assessments in evaluating ethical hacking skills Designing effective hands-on evaluations for candidates Challenges in creating realistic and fair practical challenges Techniques for assessing candidates&amp;rsquo; ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities Strategies for providing feedback and gauging potential in ethical hacking</description></item><item><title>How to perform threat assessments, the right way!</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/threat-modeling/how-to-perform-threat-assessments-the-right-way/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/threat-modeling/how-to-perform-threat-assessments-the-right-way/</guid><description>About the session: Threat actors continue to bypass all kind of defensive and detective measures. Nevertheless, prevention remains the most cost-effective method to keep threats away. In particular, most organizations still prefer to invest in a variety of less effective tools. The question is: Are you relying on the right metric, to assess the security posture of your service? If standard metrics such as CVSS is not accurate enough, then what kind of metric should you consider for vulnerabilities without CVE, such as those related to your own business logic?</description></item><item><title>Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Recruitment(Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/leveraging-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-in-recruitment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/leveraging-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-in-recruitment/</guid><description>About this session This topic explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in cybersecurity professionals&amp;rsquo; recruitment and selection process. Panelists will discuss the benefits and considerations of AI/ML algorithms for resume screening, candidate evaluation, and job fit prediction.
