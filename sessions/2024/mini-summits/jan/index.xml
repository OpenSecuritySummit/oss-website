In this session, we will delve into two distinct perspectives. Timo advocates for a purely OpenSource approach, as exemplified by metricCA. On the other hand, Benji and Lars are inclined to leverage existing &amp;ldquo;as-a-service&amp;rdquo; solutions within his organization.
The crux of our discussion will be: Can we merge these approaches to avoid duplicating efforts in tool development for the same purpose?</description></item><item><title>AI-Driven Threat Modelling with STRIDE GPT</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/threat-modeling/ai-driven-threat-modelling-with-stride-gpt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/threat-modeling/ai-driven-threat-modelling-with-stride-gpt/</guid><description>About this session &amp;ldquo;In this presentation, I will introduce STRIDE GPT, an AI-powered tool that leverages the latest OpenAI GPT models to generate comprehensive threat models and attack trees. Designed to enhance cybersecurity practices, STRIDE GPT also assists professionals by suggesting possible mitigations for identified threats, ensuring a proactive approach to security.
Attendees will gain insights into the integration of AI with traditional threat modelling techniques, observe a live demonstration of the tool in action, and understand the benefits of incorporating AI-driven security solutions into their own practices.</description></item><item><title>Alert Readiness Framework</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/alert-readiness-framework/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/alert-readiness-framework/</guid><description>About this session Join us for an insightful webinar as we unveil the Alert Readiness Framework (ARF), a powerful tool in modern cybersecurity.

Organisations can tap into new revenue streams by productizing their service capabilities through APIs. However, with the growing use of APIs also come new security risks. APIs represent gateways into our systems, and security vulnerabilities in our APIs can open organisations to different forms of attacks. In this talk, I’ll explain how API design affects security.</description></item><item><title>Battling the coming wave, Understanding cybersecurity in 2024</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/battling-the-coming-wave-understanding-cybersecurity-in-2024/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/battling-the-coming-wave-understanding-cybersecurity-in-2024/</guid><description>About the session: Looking at the effect that Generative AI has had on the ways in which business protect themselves from the latest in threats from bad actors walking through how AI has changed the approach to protection and what tools, techniques and technologies businesses should be applying to protection in 2024.

Securing every door, window, network, endpoint, device, API, and system is an overwhelmingly endless task. How can we hope to keep the enterprise secure while the threat landscape keeps evolving ever faster?
It is time for an age of champions. Security Champions.
Security champions are individual team members on teams outside of security who volunteer to stay up to date with security updates and help spread the word.</description></item><item><title>Ethical Hacking Challenges: Evaluating Practical Skills in Selection Processes (Panel</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/ethical-hacking-challenge.mds-evaluating-practical-skills-in-selection-processes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/ethical-hacking-challenge.mds-evaluating-practical-skills-in-selection-processes/</guid><description>About this session This topic focuses on evaluating the practical skills of candidates in ethical hacking during the selection process.

Nevertheless, prevention remains the most cost-effective method to keep threats away. In particular, most organizations still prefer to invest in a variety of less effective tools. The question is: Are you relying on the right metric, to assess the security posture of your service? If standard metrics such as CVSS is not accurate enough, then what kind of metric should you consider for vulnerabilities without CVE, such as those related to your own business logic?</description></item><item><title>Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Recruitment(Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/leveraging-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-in-recruitment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/leveraging-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-in-recruitment/</guid><description>About this session This topic explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in cybersecurity professionals&amp;rsquo; recruitment and selection process.

This complexity requires methodical comprehensive reviews to secure the entire stack. Often a company may lack the time, specialist security knowledge, and people needed to secure their CI/CD pipelines. Realising these facts; cyberattacks targeting CI/CD pipelines has been gaining momentum, and attackers increasingly understand that build pipelines are highly-privileged targets with a substantial attack surface. In this presentation, we will share some of our observation through showing different flavours of attack on possible development pipelines, and introduce a tool to detect them.</description></item><item><title>Stop Committing Your Secrets - Git Hooks To The Rescue</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/devsecops/stop-committing-your-secrets-git-hooks-to-the-rescue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/devsecops/stop-committing-your-secrets-git-hooks-to-the-rescue/</guid><description>About this session &amp;ldquo;No one wants their keys, passwords, and other secrets exposed. Ideally, no developer would ever hardcode anything like that into their work, but unfortunately, a lot of repos are just one bad push from the world gaining access to sensitive data and mission-critical systems. In the best-case scenario, you discover the issue and fix it before something terrible happens, but in the worse cases, you don’t find out until it is far too late.</description></item><item><title>Technics to limit hallucinations when using a LLM solution like ChatGPT</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/technics-to-limit-hallucinations-when-using-a-llm-solution-like-chatgpt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/technics-to-limit-hallucinations-when-using-a-llm-solution-like-chatgpt/</guid><description>About this session Join us in an exciting session with Matthew Thompson as he delves into the innovative world of Large Language Models (LLM) like ChatGPT.

Finding out after the fact does little to protect your systems and your data.
Ideally, you would want to set an alarm that an attacker would trigger while limiting the damage to your environment.
We know from many recent breaches that attackers commonly try to expand their foothold in a system by finding and exploiting hardcoded credentials in environments they have accessed.</description></item></channel></rss>
