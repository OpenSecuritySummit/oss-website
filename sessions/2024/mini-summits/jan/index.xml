Organisations can tap into new revenue streams by productizing their service capabilities through APIs. However, with the growing use of APIs also come new security risks. APIs represent gateways into our systems, and security vulnerabilities in our APIs can open organisations to different forms of attacks. In this talk, I’ll explain how API design affects security.</description></item><item><title>Battling the coming wave, Understanding cybersecurity in 2024</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/battling-the-coming-wave-understanding-cybersecurity-in-2024/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/battling-the-coming-wave-understanding-cybersecurity-in-2024/</guid><description>About the session: Looking at the effect that Generative AI has had on the ways in which business protect themselves from the latest in threats from bad actors walking through how AI has changed the approach to protection and what tools, techniques and technologies businesses should be applying to protection in 2024.

Nevertheless, prevention remains the most cost-effective method to keep threats away. In particular, most organizations still prefer to invest in a variety of less effective tools. The question is: Are you relying on the right metric, to assess the security posture of your service? If standard metrics such as CVSS is not accurate enough, then what kind of metric should you consider for vulnerabilities without CVE, such as those related to your own business logic?</description></item><item><title>IoT and Cyber Threat Intelligence: Staying Ahead of the Curve (Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/devsecops/iot-and-cyber-threat-intelligence-staying-ahead-of-the-curve/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/devsecops/iot-and-cyber-threat-intelligence-staying-ahead-of-the-curve/</guid><description>About the session: This topic focuses on the integration of cyber threat intelligence with IoT security.
