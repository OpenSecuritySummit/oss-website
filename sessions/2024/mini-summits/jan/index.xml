&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re excited to invite you to a dynamic discussion featuring Benji, Lars, Timo, and yourself, focusing on the strategies for collecting and showcasing DevSecOps metrics effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this session, we will delve into two distinct perspectives. Timo advocates for a purely OpenSource approach, as exemplified by &lt;a href="https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/metricCA">metricCA&lt;/a>. On the other hand, Benji and Lars are inclined to leverage existing &amp;ldquo;as-a-service&amp;rdquo; solutions within his organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crux of our discussion will be: Can we merge these approaches to avoid duplicating efforts in tool development for the same purpose? This talk promises to offer insightful viewpoints and foster a collaborative environment where we can explore the synergy between different methodologies in DevSecOps metrics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI-Driven Threat Modelling with STRIDE GPT</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/threat-modeling/ai-driven-threat-modelling-with-stride-gpt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/threat-modeling/ai-driven-threat-modelling-with-stride-gpt/</guid><description>&lt;iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQzOqKvccdSPsVcV3SuurY9EHobCiFw68oda2-pi8tVqz1K5F2Cg0e3X0OaLA0_Hg/embed?slide=id.p/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true">&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>APIs are transforming the way we build applications and deliver business value. Organisations can tap into new revenue streams by productizing their service capabilities through APIs. However, with the growing use of APIs also come new security risks. APIs represent gateways into our systems, and security vulnerabilities in our APIs can open organisations to different forms of attacks. In this talk, I’ll explain how API design affects security.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Battling the coming wave, Understanding cybersecurity in 2024</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/battling-the-coming-wave-understanding-cybersecurity-in-2024/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/battling-the-coming-wave-understanding-cybersecurity-in-2024/</guid><description>&lt;iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTD0kXj6rgCKvNR_KmbSCfet78JITkuzw5kog_kZSioLp6bDN2Mo6lDVFlwMancGQ/embed?slide=id.p/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true">&lt;/iframe>

&lt;p>Security teams, at best, are outnumbered 100 to 1 in their organizations. Securing every door, window, network, endpoint, device, API, and system is an overwhelmingly endless task. How can we hope to keep the enterprise secure while the threat landscape keeps evolving ever faster?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is time for an age of champions. Security Champions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Security champions are individual team members on teams outside of security who volunteer to stay up to date with security updates and help spread the word. They look for places where security best practices can be applied and help the security team know where people are struggling and have questions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ethical Hacking Challenges: Evaluating Practical Skills in Selection Processes (Panel</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/ethical-hacking-challenge.mds-evaluating-practical-skills-in-selection-processes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/ethical-hacking-challenge.mds-evaluating-practical-skills-in-selection-processes/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Threat actors continue to bypass all kind of defensive and detective measures. Nevertheless, prevention remains the most cost-effective method to keep threats away. In particular, most organizations still prefer to invest in a variety of less effective tools. The question is: Are you relying on the right metric, to assess the security posture of your service? If standard metrics such as CVSS is not accurate enough, then what kind of metric should you consider for vulnerabilities without CVE, such as those related to your own business logic? Let&amp;rsquo;s dive deep into most common mistakes by software architects and security professionals alike, and how to optimize the time spent on developing secure products to get the best out of your entire team.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Recruitment(Panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/leveraging-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-in-recruitment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/governance/leveraging-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-in-recruitment/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>CI/CD pipelines are complex environments. This complexity requires methodical comprehensive reviews to secure the entire stack. Often a company may lack the time, specialist security knowledge, and people needed to secure their CI/CD pipelines. Realising these facts; cyberattacks targeting CI/CD pipelines has been gaining momentum, and attackers increasingly understand that build pipelines are highly-privileged targets with a substantial attack surface. In this presentation, we will share some of our observation through showing different flavours of attack on possible development pipelines, and introduce a tool to detect them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stop Committing Your Secrets - Git Hooks To The Rescue</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/devsecops/stop-committing-your-secrets-git-hooks-to-the-rescue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/jan/devsecops/stop-committing-your-secrets-git-hooks-to-the-rescue/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;No one wants their keys, passwords, and other secrets exposed. Ideally, no developer would ever hardcode anything like that into their work, but unfortunately, a lot of repos are just one bad push from the world gaining access to sensitive data and mission-critical systems. In the best-case scenario, you discover the issue and fix it before something terrible happens, but in the worse cases, you don’t find out until it is far too late.

&lt;p>Intrusion detection works best when you can discover the attacker while they are still in the system. Finding out after the fact does little to protect your systems and your data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ideally, you would want to set an alarm that an attacker would trigger while limiting the damage to your environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We know from many recent breaches that attackers commonly try to expand their foothold in a system by finding and exploiting hardcoded credentials in environments they have accessed. We can use these behavioral patterns to our advantage by engaging in defensive cyber deception.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
