By understanding the latter, attendees will learn how to analyse their firms&amp;rsquo; internal processes for software ingestion, integration, and testing to account for Supply Risk both during and after deployment. Attendees will also understand how the risk-based model can respond to software supply chain attacks even when they are not detected until later in the internal software supply chain, and gain critical insight into the kinds of changes needed in their organisations&amp;rsquo; internal processes and software tools to support this approach.</description></item><item><title>IoT Security: Safeguarding the Internet of Things Ecosystem (panel)</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/sep/governance/iot-security-safeguarding-the-internet-of-things-ecosystem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2024/mini-summits/sep/governance/iot-security-safeguarding-the-internet-of-things-ecosystem/</guid><description>About this session The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices introduces new security challenges, including device vulnerabilities, data privacy concerns, and ecosystem complexity.
