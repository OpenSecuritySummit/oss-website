&lt;p>IT and OT (Operational Technology, including the subset ICS - Industrial Control Systems) have traditionally operated and been managed separately, and OT tends to lack visibility and threat protection, especially due to legacy software and equipment, outdated operating systems, vendor restrictions, and other factors. Insecure passwords and direct internet connections also still pose a challenge, as well as lack of security staff and skilling dedicated to these industrial systems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Awards and Networking / drinks time</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/social/wards-and-networking-drinks-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/social/wards-and-networking-drinks-time/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Bridging the skill gap and hiring challenges in cyber</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/bridging-the-skill-gap-and-hiring-challenges-in-cyber/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/bridging-the-skill-gap-and-hiring-challenges-in-cyber/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2></description></item><item><title>How do male and female voices project authority in Cyber</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/how-do-male-and-female-voices-project-authority-in-cyber/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/governance/how-do-male-and-female-voices-project-authority-in-cyber/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This discussion will aim to explore authority issues connected to men/women in cyber particularly during the onboarding process and regarding retention. We will aim to explore:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>who people in cyber look to as authority figures in cyber today&lt;/li>
&lt;li>examine whether there may be any pre-programmed biases in the sector in prioritising male authority figures;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>how this is reflected in sector-specific literature - the citation and reference to female voices,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>whether there is a relationship between these ideas around authority and the confidence/competence debate,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>how this dichotomy in turn impacts communication between female hires and their managers during the recruitment process,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>how women feel being managed by other women as well as by men,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>whether/how these ideas and dynamics work differently in new start-up business models than in established business hierarchies.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The OWASP Nettacker project was created to automate information gathering, vulnerability scanning, and in general to aid the penetration testing engagements. Nettacker is able to run various scans using a variety of methods and generate scan reports for applications and networks, including services, bugs, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, default credentials and many other cool features - for example the ability to chain different scan methods. This relatively new (Summer 2017) and a lesser-known OWASP project has generated a huge amount of interest at BlackHat Europe 2018/2019 Arsenal live demo gathering massive crowds of seasoned hackers and penetration testers eager to see this new tool in action. This talk will showcase the OWASP Nettacker project giving an overview of its features and including a live demo of the tool.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Wardley Maps changed how I think</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/wardley-maps/why-wardley-maps-changed-how-i-think/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/jul/wardley-maps/why-wardley-maps-changed-how-i-think/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-this-session">About this session&lt;/h2>
