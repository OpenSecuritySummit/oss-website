Abstract  Vulnerability tooling is increasing, security advisories are faster, and teams are leaner. Have we lost the battle of vulnerabilities, is shift left and is security everyone’s problem working? We present a risk and cyber quantification view on vulnerabilities across cloud, application, and infrastructure addressing modern approaches to cybersecurity from the point of view of the product security team.</description></item><item><title>Crowdsourcing Security Talent</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/dec/governance/crowdsourcing-security-talent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/dec/governance/crowdsourcing-security-talent/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Demystifying Risk and the Future of Vulnerability Management</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/dec/governance/demystifying-risk-and-the-future-of-vulnerability-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/dec/governance/demystifying-risk-and-the-future-of-vulnerability-management/</guid><description>About this session This talk provides the short comings in current vulnerability scoring techniques like CVSS, EPSS when it comes to triaging vulnerabilities. Provides directions, scientific foundations and use cases of how to build more robust vulnerability management programs that is driven by risk based decisions. This talk also gives sneak peak into current state of art research, use cases and open problems in this fascinating and emerging area of &amp;ldquo;Cyber Risk Intelligence&amp;rdquo; (Not to be confused with Cyber Threat Intelligence).</description></item><item><title>Linux (kernel) containerization without Docker/runc/OCI</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/linux-kernel-containerization-without-dockerruncoci/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/linux-kernel-containerization-without-dockerruncoci/</guid><description>About this session A Linux® container is a set of 1 or more processes that are isolated from the rest of the system. That is available in Linux/Unix (kernel) from decade. In this topic, will explore the layers, isolation, privileges, environments/resource utilization etc for a Linux process and use the same as container/isolated env. Also will discuss the security concerns regarding why not Docker. It will help students, working professionals to understand the concepts of Linux kernel namespace and kernel level privileges for containerization.</description></item><item><title>Open Policy Agent</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/open-policy-agent/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/open-policy-agent/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Open Source Security</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/open-source-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/dec/devsecops/open-source-security/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Practical approach/considerations to developing a cybersecurity program</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/dec/governance/practical-approachconsiderations-to-developing-a-cybersecurity-program/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/dec/governance/practical-approachconsiderations-to-developing-a-cybersecurity-program/</guid><description>About this session In Practical approach\considerations to developing a cybersecurity program.
