Everyone wants to put tests into the release pipeline, but no one wants to wait hours for them to finish. In this talk we will discuss multiple options for adding dynamic application security testing (DAST) to your CI/CD, in ways that won’t compromise speed or results, such as limiting scope, using HAR files, using test subsets, etc. Then we will do it!</description></item><item><title>Adversary Simulation: Close the Gaps in Your Security Posture</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/adversary-simulation-close-the-gaps-in-your-security-posture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/adversary-simulation-close-the-gaps-in-your-security-posture/</guid><description>About this session Can you validate your security posture and assess your network resilience against an adversary?

The session also covers the common pitfall of organization in throwing technologies at problem and how to include people for a successful programme</description></item><item><title>Beat Alert Fatigue with Cyber Asset Relationship Graphs</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/beat-alert-fatigue-with-cyber-asset-relationship-graphs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/beat-alert-fatigue-with-cyber-asset-relationship-graphs/</guid><description>About this session Reference:https://info.jupiterone.com/resources/scar-report-2022
Cloud security is noisy - our research shows the average organization has a backlog of over 120,000 findings from cloud security posture management and vulnerability scanning tools. Yet, despite the volume of data, security operations teams struggle to answer even seemingly simple questions about open source vulnerabilities or event triggers.
Learn why cloud attack surface management is much simpler with cyber asset and relationship graphs - using open source solutions to deploy knowledge graphs in your environment (can be accomplished with Gremlin, Sparql, or TinkerPop, as well as other OSS solutions).</description></item><item><title>CDC - Collective Defence Clusters</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/cdc-collective-defence-clusters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/cdc-collective-defence-clusters/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>Dependency Management and Supply Chain Security</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/dependency-management-and-supply-chain-security/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/dependency-management-and-supply-chain-security/</guid><description>Session slides About this session Modern software has dependencies – lots of dependencies, especially when including the transitive ones. Most of these dependencies are open source packages downloaded from a public software repository. Any of those dependencies may have vulnerabilities, include a supply-chain attack or use unwanted licenses. All this may change with any version. That’s why actively managing dependencies should be one of the focus areas of software development.</description></item><item><title>Docker For Security Professionals</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/docker-for-security-professionals/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/docker-for-security-professionals/</guid><description>About this session Getting Started with Docker, Installation , Docker Engine and Security Tools

Having to then go back and fix the security bugs, 6 months to a year later, can be a pain. In this talk, you’ll learn common approaches of hacking your own apps and APIs (called offensive testing) from the get-go, so that you can learn how to respond (fixing vulnerabilities in your code) earlier in the software development life cycle.</description></item><item><title>How can we make Grafana a great open source security tool?</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/how-can-we-make-grafana-a-great-open-source-security-tool.devsecops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/devsecops/how-can-we-make-grafana-a-great-open-source-security-tool.devsecops/</guid><description>About this session</description></item><item><title>How to overcome DNS security threats</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/how-to-overcome-dns-security-threat/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/governance/how-to-overcome-dns-security-threat/</guid><description>About this session DNS security basics, DNS layer security challenges

The improvements from technology vendors have got so much better that the only bad things an insider can do is click on malware. However, in that same time the number of devices which are not managed or overseen by end users has grown.</description></item><item><title>Threat Model for an Autonomous System</title><link>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/threat-modeling/threat-model-for-an-autonomous-system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-security-summit.org/sessions/2022/mini-summits/may/threat-modeling/threat-model-for-an-autonomous-system/</guid><description>About the session:</description></item></channel></rss>
